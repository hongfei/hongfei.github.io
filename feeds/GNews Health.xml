Archaeologists at Magna Roman Fort have uncovered leather footwear that is unusually large for the period, in some cases longer than 12 inches, with one example measuring roughly 12.8 inches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the discovery stands out in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-roman-concrete-offers-lessons-for-sustainable-building/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; archaeology and raises fresh questions about who was wearing what on Hadrian’s Wall. The find is not a one-off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the season’s assemblage at Magna, about a quarter of the shoes exceed 11.8 inches, while a nearby site, Vindolanda, shows only a tiny fraction of supersized examples in its long-studied collection. That contrast invites careful comparison rather than quick conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/classics//about-us/greene.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Greene&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at &lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;rn University&lt;/a&gt; and the Vindolanda Trust’s footwear specialist, and &lt;a href="https://ajaonline.org/author/4743/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Andrew Birley&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Director of Excavations at the &lt;a href="https://romanarmymuseum.com/about-vindolanda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vindolanda Trust&lt;/a&gt;, are among the researchers interpreting the new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-size-for-roman-shoes"&gt;Surprising size for Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/317-skeletons-from-the-roman-empire-found-beneath-an-old-shopping-center/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear usually mirrors modern feet more than myths suggest, which is why Magna’s outliers get attention. Eight shoes longer than 11.8 inches have been logged so far this season, including the current Trust record at about 12.8 inches, taken from a defensive ditch just outside the fort wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What explains the upsizing here but not next door at Vindolanda, where more than 5,000 Roman shoes have been cataloged over decades of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is a garrison or community with different body types or supply habits, but the data set is still small and under conservation, so restraint is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoes are not just sizes and soles. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archeologists-discover-sculptures-that-could-be-almost-life-size-representations-of-a-roman-family/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; cobblers built layers of cowhide into sturdy platform shoes and pegged them with iron hobnails, so the outsole gripped and lasted on rough surfaces, which helps archaeologists read use, wear and gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When leather survives with seams, thongs, and nail patterns, it can point to workshop traditions, supply routes, and even rank or role within a unit or household. Those are testable lines of inquiry at Magna as conservation advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clues-from-the-soil"&gt;Clues from the soil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shoes survive because the ditch fills at Magna have been at least partly anaerobic, meaning oxygen was limited and decay slowed way down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low oxygen, high groundwater, and fine sediments together create &lt;a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/preserving-archaeological-remains/heag100e-appendix4-water-monitoring-for-archaeological-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preservation pockets&lt;/a&gt; where organic finds hang on for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those conditions also seal in fragile traces of daily life, like insect parts, seeds, and parasite eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Vindolanda, just a short walk east along the frontier, previously recovered roundworm and whipworm eggs from drain sediments linked to a latrine, which adds a health dimension to material culture studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preserving-ancient-roman-shoes"&gt;Preserving ancient Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same chemistry that protects leather can be undone by drying soils, fluctuating water tables, and shifts in oxidation reduction potential (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.nt.ca/sites/ecc/files/oxidation-reduction_potential.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ORP&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site monitoring on Hadrian’s Wall has documented the vulnerability of waterlogged archaeology to modern weather patterns, which is a polite way of saying that climate variability can accelerate loss of information in a single hot, dry season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94853-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have paired portable X-ray fluorescence with microbial DNA surveys to track how buried conditions shape preservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work provides a technical baseline for interpreting the state of organic artefacts and for planning how to stabilize deposits before they turn aerobic and start crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only celebrate and marvel at the diversity and differences of these people if we can still see them in the archaeological data we gather today,” said Birley, pointing to the bigger picture that sits behind a single large sole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-watch-as-analysis-continues"&gt;What to watch as analysis continues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservators expect modest shrinkage during treatment, so final measurements may tick down a hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the current proportions already push the edges of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasas-roman-space-telescope-hopes-to-solve-the-dark-matter-mystery/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear known from Britain and justify careful comparison to the long-run dataset at Vindolanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear patterns, nail layouts, and any surviving uppers will help distinguish winter boots from everyday shoes, and medical padding from sizing differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context matters, so associated pottery and construction phases inside the fort will anchor the footwear in time and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frontier-that-keeps-teaching"&gt;Frontier that keeps teaching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadrian’s Wall is famous for stone and turf, but its quieter story is the organic record below the grass. When that record holds together, it can show how soldiers and families shopped, worked, walked, and stayed warm, right down to what got tracked through a doorway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why Magna’s ditch fills matter beyond a headline about big feet. They give archaeologists more than a snapshot, they give a sequence of choices across seasons and supplies that we cannot reconstruct from pottery alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-hygiene-and-the-small-stuff"&gt;Health, hygiene, and the small stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists are also looking for tiny traces in the same layers, since these deposits can contain important health-related evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24141513/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paleoparasitology&lt;/a&gt; integrates microscope work with site context to trace infections across time and place, and it already has a track record in Roman Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, the latrine drain eggs confirmed gastrointestinal infections that were widespread across the empire, a pattern echoed by independent &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/roman-toilets-gave-no-clear-health-benefit-and-romanisation-actually-spread-parasites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of Roman sanitation and parasite prevalence. That kind of evidence sits in the same micro-environments that keep leather intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest next step is the hardest: patient conservation, measurement, and context-by-context analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then will the statistics settle enough to test whether Magna’s footwear points to taller people, different supply chains, or colder kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the preservation question will not wait forever. Keeping ditch fills wet and low in oxygen is not just a technical preference, it is the condition that keeps this period’s most personal artefacts readable at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:42:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQRkNXNDR4QktZTWswM082cFFLNVVWZ0RMU0xld3BkZXFMaUVRQlA5a1FXU2NySERndVM5QXBfbHZ5T0E0cHVpTFJjYnQwSWkxa1l5ZTAyNm52OWlwNHh6WGN4WXlMRDB4NC1yOGNFNkJLa3I5VU4waDNIUHAtSUlZWGdseDRHVGJxcGk0SklqVXJqcWR4WFF2Y3p5c211TWN1bzNwZzB5OFpPNmx3OTludQ</guid></item><item><title>索马里白喉病例螺旋上升，卫生官员警告-《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQS3ZkYm1YR0N0QjhyVGlaZ084dndNMmNvUEsxTm43OFdqczFHVVA1S3dlZzJ5QVJ4bElfSUNGT2NSd0FtbFBLYVRvV0F5dEd1RWJqM2RBd0dGS1FEbzhEV2tPejdsZGt1RnJjM2FYTnFTQl9oQlJIMEpCQ1NhS3VpQkpYMlpxcUds?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Diphtheria cases are rapidly increasing across &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, officials and humanitarians warn, with children accounting for more than 97% of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Diphtheria, a highly contagious and deadly bacterial disease that mainly affects children, is preventable by a vaccine.

We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed’s hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF’s Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system’s capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGO &lt;a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2025-press-releases/infectious-diseases-in-somalia-double-in-3-months" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQS3ZkYm1YR0N0QjhyVGlaZ084dndNMmNvUEsxTm43OFdqczFHVVA1S3dlZzJ5QVJ4bElfSUNGT2NSd0FtbFBLYVRvV0F5dEd1RWJqM2RBd0dGS1FEbzhEV2tPejdsZGt1RnJjM2FYTnFTQl9oQlJIMEpCQ1NhS3VpQkpYMlpxcUds</guid></item><item><title>性建议：当我脱下约会对象的裤子时，我感到震惊。我不知道接下来该怎么走。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE0weFd2WGZLaXBzdEJxN3lOdGZ4ampQZEFMY2x4U1VzVmJLMmNRZ05OcW90dW5IQW9CenFIdVJsdnVRd3BDYVVFdjlMeDg1MlpBNnJWakU4dTdnbDJ6SmJDYmRSc1dBQzcyRUFQa2s5UV9CU2Y0MWxtRnZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy0zc00123b79n5u3ef2f@published"&gt;I recently started casually online dating after leaving an abusive marriage, and it’s been going great! There have been lots of nice guys, and we have had some sexy fun. That said, I’ve run into a weird situation that I’m almost certainly overthinking but am baffled by.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy11a00133b79nfn96917@published"&gt;I used to work in adult retail in my early 20s and am a very empathetic and sex positive person, all of which is information I share either before meeting or on the first date. I went on a first date last night with a great, interesting, funny guy that I got along very well with, who told me after dinner that he has a medical condition that causes incredibly painful erections and, because of this, has had difficulty with intercourse (and subsequently, online dating). Being the curious and empathetic person I am, I asked if he wanted to take me back to my place, and we had some really incredible foreplay.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy13700143b79ftv82enj@published"&gt;When his pants came off, I found that his penis was bent upwards in a U shape with his head pointing back towards his stomach. I saw a decent assortment of penises in my porn store days and am good at keeping my face neutral when I see something new at this point (with my apologies to the guy with the micropenis I slept with when I was 19), so I modified my usual blowjob routine to work with what I had and we were able to have relatively satisfying PIV intercourse, that he initiated. I have two questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy15700153b793pq807gi@published"&gt;How can I balance wanting to make sure he’s not in pain and is enjoying things as we try stuff out with not completely killing the mood every time we switch to something new, especially since there isn’t a blanket answer to what will or won’t be painful on a given encounter? He has the type of personality where I’m concerned he might not vocalize that he’s in pain, so I don’t feel weird about the whole thing, but I don’t want to be causing him discomfort. My other question, and I feel bad for saying this, is… I love a good dick. So much. And after getting out of a bad marriage with bad sex, I was really looking forward to exploring the world of dicks for a while. I’ve been open with him about the fact that I’m just casually dating at this point, so I’m not especially concerned that I’m leading him on, but am I a total … dick if I come to realize that it’s a deal-breaker for me? And if it is, how do I say or not say that so that I don’t make this sweet man feel any more awkward about his condition?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1bb00183b79anb32nxu@published"&gt;Talk to him about how, in general, you need to feel like your sexual partners will let you know if they’re in discomfort. Make it clear that this is something important to you, regardless of the individual’s body or any rare differences, but, you know, without emphasizing the latter excessively. Ask him whether he feels like he’s able to do that. If he’s unsure, find out what might be holding him back from doing so. If you still aren’t comfortable assuming he’ll say something in the moment, that’s a cue to move along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1da00193b79jljbdqo5@published"&gt;You almost certainly already have some awareness of his facial expressions, body language, and vocalizations during sex. During this initial phase, focus a little extra on understanding what he looks and sounds like when he’s having a good time, and when he’s experiencing discomfort, until you feel like you have a pretty good grasp of his individual lexicon. If you’re inclined to notice tactile cues, such as certain parts of his body developing tension, make note of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1fg001a3b79tbx11m18@published"&gt;From there, it’s the same reliance on the twin pillars of “I trust this person to usually notice and speak up if they’re uncomfortable” and “I trust myself to usually notice if their signs of pleasure stop or signs of pain start” that we tend to have in sexual encounters. Even together, the two aren’t completely foolproof. But they are the best we can do without the ability to read minds.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1i0001b3b79zkaaeu4g@published"&gt;As for whether it’s a dick move to decide that the sex isn’t working for you in a way that your partner can’t do anything about, broadly speaking, I’d say no. No more than it’s a dick move to decide you’re unwilling to relocate to a different city, live a significantly different type of lifestyle, or date people of genders outside your sexual orientation. What would be a dick move, though, is focusing entirely on people’s dicks as a metric of whether you’re interested in continuing to see them. I suspect that when you’re considering your dates, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; factoring in many other features. So, as much as this man’s member is quite the outlier, keep an eye on the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1k2001c3b792051ppil@published"&gt;If you do decide to end the relationship, remember that no matter how gentle you are, you can’t control how he reacts. There’s one possible world where you let him know that you’re no longer interested in seeing each other, and he’s relieved because he’s been trying to figure out a way to break things off with you. There’s another where you end the relationship over, say, political views, and he still makes it out to be a rejection over his dick. One thing you can do at this stage, while you’re waiting to find out what your feelings are toward him (and his anatomy), is resist any temptation to see him every other day or stay in constant contact—keep things as casual as you’ve told him they’re going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="200" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfg001p3b79cnpsqc16@published"&gt;As a 21-year-old woman who is a virgin, I know I’m late to sex. I’d ideally like to start having some—but be it because of my generation’s sex recession, my own shyness, or the complete absence of dating culture, the opportunity has never really presented itself. I never dated in high school (I wasn’t interested, and was too focused on getting into college to have a relationship), and by the time I got to college, I just kind of assumed it would happen on its own. But in truth, there isn’t much of a culture of hookups or dating at my college, as it’s very small and competitive. Everyone is pretty awkward all around. I’ve had a longer-term relationship with a guy before, but he was religious and wanted to wait until marriage, so nothing ever happened (we broke up for reasons unrelated to sex). Hinge led to a handful of OK first dates, and Tinder led to six cancellations and two honestly terrible in-person encounters. I’ve since deleted the apps to focus on school and just to get off my phone. At this point, I’m not even sure if I’m into men, or if I might lean more lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001q3b7982ulrkgn@published"&gt;I felt like my college years were hyped up as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun. I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m decently attractive, funny, and have plenty of friends at school and work; in all other ways but this, I have my life together. My parents and relatives frequently question why I’m not in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001r3b790ze6kzvp@published"&gt;Is there any way forward in this situation? I’m not looking for a long-term relationship right now, but should I try for one just to see where things go? Redownload the apps, or try a different platform? Or just surrender and accept that my virginity doesn’t really matter to anyone but me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001u3b7957lp7tzj@published"&gt;I’m guessing that part of your perception of college as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun comes from the media you were exposed to growing up—be that social media or television and film. But both memes and movies tend to distort reality. A whole bunch of people in previous generations got through college and then found themselves feeling they’d missed out on a big bacchanal. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/i-lived-through-peak-indie-sleaze-gen-z-need-to-stop-glamourising-it"&gt;a lot of Millennial hook-up culture took place in a context of large quantities of alcohol and substances&lt;/a&gt;, which has a way of removing inhibitions. Given the ways that inebriation clouds consent, it’s for the best that this former fad has faded.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001v3b796ivzd88g@published"&gt;Another cultural institution that seems to be transforming is the dating app. Where 15 to 20 years ago, dating apps often felt like they were opening up a whole world of romantic and sexual partners we might be more likely to share interests and desires with, many people now describe them with a lot of frustration, often lamenting that they’re full of scammers and profiles that seem to be bots. Mostly, though, lots of people—including your peers, and maybe even some of your classmates—are having the same desire you describe of wanting to get off their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001w3b79xa7fmuh0@published"&gt;So get out there and meet people. Join a club, bring any schoolwork that can be done in a public space to a cafe or similar, and go out with friends. Do whatever you can to put yourself in situations where you might socialize. Keep an open mind about whether the people you’re meeting will fit in your life at all, and especially what form being in your life might take. Maybe you make some new friends, you find someone to hook up with, or you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find someone you want to develop something longer-term and romantic with (and who wants the same with you). Yes, there will likely be some awkward moments. Those uncomfortable moments often decrease with experience and practice. Most of your cohort are probably in a similar position—they all went through the upheaval of COVID lockdowns in their high school years, too, and you’re all part of the same generation that is reportedly going through a “sex recession” (however &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/04/gen-z-generation-sex-abstience-puriteen-research-studies.html"&gt;actually accurate&lt;/a&gt; that is). Even if sparks aren’t flying, you can support each other through the experiences you’re having and longings you’re hoping to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

Build a support network that will hopefully help you through that, and you might meet someone whose desires align with yours along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past several years, we’ve slowly incorporated various toys into our sex life to great success. Our most prized possessions are a few large dildos that have become part of our standard repertoire. My wife loves being stretched out, and I love pleasuring her with them. It’s a win-win, and we have a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc66002b3b79iakjoy2p@published"&gt;Over the past year or two, however, my wife has been getting sporadic UTIs and yeast infections, and they’ve always come on the heels of a session with the big boys. We always do our best to keep everything sanitized, and we always make sure that the toys are cleaned thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap after each use and stored separately in their own bags. The dildos are never used for anything other than vaginal insertion.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002c3b793ot8s0vd@published"&gt;A few months ago, we decided to start putting condoms over the dildos to prevent any infection. (We still maintain the old cleaning routine, too. That hasn’t changed.) Things were going great until our last session, when my wife got yet another yeast infection after an evening with her largest toy wrapped up in a condom. We are both feeling frustrated and stumped. We love playing with the toys but it’s crushing for me to see her in discomfort and pain the day after a fun evening. Is this just a normal risk of using large toys? Are there better precautions that we could be taking? Is there something we’re missing?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002e3b7900ypzlrg@published"&gt;It’s worth your wife making a trip to her gynecologist, explaining the situation, and asking for some extra testing to confirm that what she’s experiencing really is recurring UTIs and yeast infections. So many different factors can throw off a vaginal microbiome, and more than one can result in the kind of discharge that looks like a yeast infection or the symptoms that read as a UTI, but it could be &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/better-me/is-it-a-yeast-infection-or-something-else"&gt;something else entirely&lt;/a&gt;. She should call the office, explain the situation briefly, and ask when it is best to come in—sometimes the doctor needs to see the issue when it’s active, and sometimes they want certain tests run before the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

Since both of you enjoy this practice, it might be that big toys need to be a special occasion activity and reserved for times when she’ll be able to recover in comfort afterward. The good news is that there’s a whole wild world of sexual practices outside of big toys, and a significant chance that you’ll be able to find something else you both love just as much to fold into your repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

But one health gym-goer revealed she was drinking so much it nearly killed her (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/water-hydration-exercise-heat-hyponatremia.html"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Cameron wrote on&lt;span&gt; top of her water consumption she would consume more liquid through her 'morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!)', and any other drinks she happened to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The writer explained: 'Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much. And now I was in danger.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, women should drink about 11.5 cups of water per day (2.7 liters), while men should consume 15.5 cups (3.7 liters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you're exercising in the heat, aim for four to eight ounces every 20 minutes, depending on the intensity of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron was drinking to keep hydrated but she wasn't replacing the sodium lost from her sweat through sodium-rich foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sports drinks packed with electrolytes are one of the most convenient options for athletes or those engaging in intense physical activity to keep their sodium levels in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy sodium levels in the blood typically range from 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and a level below this range is considered hyponatremia, or low sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron did not reveal what her reading was, just that it was below the healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when drinking too much water within a short time frame overwhelms the body's organs, namely the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the kidneys filter out extra water and waste, producing urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Thunder Jalili, a professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah, previously told the Wall Street Journal that a person's kidneys can typically filter out one liter of water every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you drink more than a liter of water an hour, that's when you run into the risk of potentially diluting your electrolytes,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Putnam (pictured), then 74, suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sodium, which is vital for regulating the amount of fluid in the body, but having too little of it causes water to build up around the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells then swell, leading to nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, muscle weakness, dizziness, and restlessness. But in more severe cases, such as Putnam's, it can lead to heart attack-like symptoms such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron said her doctor's response was 'blunt' and she was told that if she didn't change her habits she would be 'risking far worse than a headache.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was told to drink no more than a liter of fluid daily for several days in order to bring her sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a person used to drinking up to four liters a day, she found that cutting back was 'hard.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years on from her initial diagnosis, Cameron wrote that she is better at monitoring her water intake but she is still not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded: 'Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron's story comes about a year after Texas resident John Putnam, then 74, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13714529/texas-man-rushed-hospital-water-toxicity-heart-attack.html"&gt;suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was working as a landscaper in June 2024 when the temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he mowed his second lawn of the day, Putnam was so thirsty he had consumed almost three gallons of water within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was overcome with nausea and fatigue, which turned into chest pain and trouble breathing by evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was rushed to the hospital for what he believed was a heart attack. Instead, doctors told him he had suffered water poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have suspected that water toxicity is on the rise due to an increase in heat waves across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that the condition affects anywhere from 3million to 6million Americans every year, or at least one in 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia can also be more common in older adults like Putnam. According to the Mayo Clinic, this is because older patients are more likely to take medications or suffer from conditions that lower their sodium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases of hyponatremia, brain cells swell and lead to pressure inside the skull. Blood flow to the brain then becomes reduced, resulting in seizures, coma, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for hyponatremia depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases, doctors may restrict fluids. However, more severe cases may require medications to manage low sodium levels or replacing sodium intravenously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A once-vanquished disease spread by mosquitoes may be making inroads into the United States. New Jersey officials are now investigating whether a resident’s malaria infection was locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Departments of Health (NJDOH) and Environmental Protection &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250818a.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the case Monday. The resident hadn’t recently traveled, suggesting they likely caught it from homegrown mosquitoes. If so, this would be the first locally acquired malaria case seen in the state in over three decades, though not the first such case reported in the country this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The blood-loving parasite&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/index.html"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; is caused by several species of the single-celled parasite &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;. When an infected mosquito transmits the disease to a person, the parasites will first invade certain tissues (usually the liver), reproduce, and then infect red blood cells. A small percentage of the parasites in the bloodstream will develop into a stage of life that can newly infect and grow inside mosquitoes that bite the person, starting the cycle all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The symptoms of malaria, which include fatigue, chills, and other flu-like illnesses, are caused by the damage the infection causes to our blood cells. Though most people survive their bout of malaria, it can also cause life-threatening complications like seizures, kidney failure, and sepsis. Even with available treatments today, malaria still &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; roughly 600,000 people worldwide every year—making it one of the deadliest diseases around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria was once a common threat in the U.S., particularly in warmer areas during the summer. But a dedicated public health campaign, which included mosquito spraying programs and the removal of breeding sites, eradicated the disease by the 1950s. Since then, just about all malaria cases reported in the U.S. are travel-related, originating from places where the disease is endemic. But the potential for malaria to make a comeback remains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A mosquito mystery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria is spread by the bite of a female &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito, and there are native species in the U.S. that can transmit the disease to humans, including in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though officials are unsure about the origin of this latest case, it’s possible that a person with travel-related malaria arrived in the area and was bitten by a mosquito that may have then bitten someone else. According to health officials, roughly 100 travel-related cases are reported annually in the state. If this new case is confirmed as local, this would be the first homegrown case documented in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Officials say that malaria’s threat to the greater public is minimal, but other recent cases have been locally acquired. In 2023, for instance, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00496.html"&gt;three separate clusters&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, Texas, and Maryland (at the time, they were the first local U.S. cases documented in two decades). And earlier this month, Washington officials &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; their own possible homegrown case of malaria, quite possibly the first ever found in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low as people’s risk of malaria may be, we should still do our best to prevent mosquito bites. There are other diseases that mosquitoes in the U.S. can spread outside of malaria, including West Nile virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), and even dengue fever. We can personally reduce bites by using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. And people should also do their part to clean up areas around their homes that could turn into literal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I urge the public to continue taking steps to eliminate standing water around their properties, which will go a long way to reducing the risk of mosquito breeding,” said Shawn M. LaTourette, NJ Environmental Protection Commissioner, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250818a.shtml"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “As the summer winds down, taking this simple but necessary step will help ensure quality of life and protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

The signals vary widely from person to person and from one moment to the next, which means no one should rush to treat a single breath reading as proof of recent use or impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/jennifer-berry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jennifer L. Berry&lt;/a&gt; is a research chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt;). She worked alongside colleagues from the same institution and a partnering medical campus who contributed to the study’s design and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-thc-breath-tests-matter"&gt;Why THC breath tests matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long wanted a simple roadside tool, but chemistry keeps getting in the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THC and related &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11264354/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; are large, sticky molecules that ride in airborne droplets rather than cleanly evaporating like alcohol, which complicates collection and measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why teams now test both aerosol capture devices and exhaled breath condensate (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2170898/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;) approaches that chill the breath to trap what comes out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these methods, prior studies found THC hanging around before any observed use, a reminder that abstinence windows and device sensitivity can skew results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-learned"&gt;What the study learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study enrolled 29 adults, asked them to abstain ahead of time, and collected breath samples before consumption and again at about 47 minutes, 92 minutes, and 180 minutes after eating their own labeled edible product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two devices were used, one designed to catch aerosol particles and another that collects a cooled condensate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then analyzed each sample for THC and 10 other cannabinoids using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the abstinence requests, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/popular-new-thc-variant-delta-8-is-not-harmless-despite-marketing-claims/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; appeared in pre-use breath from 27 of 29 participants, ranging from trace levels to more than 0.4 ng per device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After edible ingestion, 19 participants showed a significant increase at one or more post-use time points, 4 showed no change, and 6 showed a significant decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored,” wrote Berry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thc-breath-tests-and-baseline-issues"&gt;THC breath tests and baseline issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding of detectable and/or quantifiable THC before cannabis use shows how challenging it is to interpret a single THC concentration measurement in breath with no prior information about THC at baseline,” wrote Berry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking pattern, beyond the individual variability, is the high rate of detectable THC before anyone ate an edible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That baseline problem is not unique to breath. A 2025 systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12032524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies connecting blood THC to driving performance found that most papers reported no linear relationship, even when driving metrics like lateral control and reaction time were measured with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral fluid tests are popular because they are easy to use, but their purpose matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35640367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of over 18,000 paired samples found that although THC in oral fluid can show whether THC is present in the blood, using it to identify drivers above standard blood limits would lead to many false positives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIST’s own breath work in cannabis smokers supports taking repeated measurements rather than a one-off reading, since THC often falls sharply within hours and device methods differ in what they capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the new edible study adds a missing piece, but it does not turn breath into an instant yes or no test. It suggests that trends over time, not single snapshots, are more promising for identifying recent use across routes of administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means"&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic safety policy has leaned on numerical cutoffs for alcohol for decades. Cannabis does not play by the same rules, and federal safety agencies have said as much in &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/812440-marijuana-impaired-driving-report-to-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; to Congress that caution against equating blood THC numbers with impairment in the way we do for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have chronic users versus infrequent users, they have very different concentrations correlated to different effects,” said &lt;a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/podcast/whats-known-and-unknown-about-marijuana-part2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Scott&lt;/a&gt;, a physical scientist at NIJ’s Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tracked other cannabinoids. In many participants, CBN and CBG rose and fell in step with THC, while CBD sometimes did not, a hint that multi-analyte panels or ratios may carry more information than THC alone when the goal is to pinpoint recent use after edibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern echoes earlier breath work showing some non-THC &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trema-micrantha-brazilian-plant-contains-cbd-without-thc-found-in-cannabis/"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; appear only after use and could act as markers when combined with THC kinetics. It is a direction that calls for standard methods, shared reference materials, and longer sampling windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-thc-breath-tests"&gt;Next steps for THC breath tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a small, carefully designed study without standardized dosing, and participants brought their own edibles labeled &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-relieves-anxiety-without-the-risks-that-come-with-thc/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; that the researchers did not independently verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling ended at 3 hours, which likely missed some peak values, and device differences could influence capture and recovery. None of the breath measures were tied directly to driving performance in this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A credible breath test will require validated collection protocols, calibration standards, and clear guidance on how to interpret rising or falling readings over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pieces are starting to come together in studies that map breath changes minute by minute and compare matrices side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is measured. Breath can carry THC after edibles, the kinetics can be tracked, and multi-timepoint strategies may be the fairest and most informative way to use that signal in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jat/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jat/bkaf063/8196217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:05:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPU3hHNkxqQ25ZTEcxeDFWeC1LN0MyMDdRVzdoUnFmZjVNRmQ1YjJnMzNHdjRKU3hveWRRRGhhcXVOanBHbURlek45dDJtTE1JUDJKUzVFX1hJZldjNlpvN3dGSWRRcWdxOFJFMHNkNkFQNjJ1YnlsZGFPTENqVFh2dGt4aTFvaFBuNDNrdGQ2VHNFT1hfS2VVVDNveXhoc3U4MlZzRjdYQkJpb09KQWJHUHlEeEJJS3BFMDJKNg</guid></item><item><title>儿科小组无视RFK Jr. ，敦促为幼儿接种新冠疫苗-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOOXEyM01hYkYxbnpORXB5ZWR3ZUZfQ1dua1hkRWQ5bFNjRTJncWJrNFNMMDgxR2JzazZkNFVYWlZqT09BV0p3NGhyUllwLVBRakhwOENkUWFYTm9Jel92U2QyR0lDWnljQ0NIaXdIVTl3ZWtnUWZHdWZSakdKU0xVQ2FPVmhycDBrMG5udFJqbEdXZlAtN1BWdW8zUUtJOGxI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="00Z81XJ9ND27QB44RV1KXVEWGG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;urged parents to get their youngest children vaccinated for covid, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/24/vaccines-access-rfk-cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;broader effort&lt;/a&gt; by medical organizations to bypass Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

All but three were women, and all were living in subsidized housing. The setting was chosen because older adults, particularly in subsidized housing, often don’t have easy access to exercise facilities and may be less motivated to work out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The participants received the counseling and the brain stimulation at home, an attempt to remove barriers to treatment.

But then a patient’s neurons try to react to that, and fire up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But stimulating neurons, Fregni said, seems to help regulate chronic pain by initially overactivating the neurons involved in pain processing, and then the neurons relax, bringing down the pain circuit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;His &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;used electrical brain stimulation, along with exercise, and pain education for 112 women with fibromyalgia, and found the approach effective for helping to manage pain. The researchers taught the participants how to operate the brain stimulation device at home, and they were instructed to do this five times a week for four weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Fregni said the pain relief benefits started to decrease four weeks after the treatments ended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Whatever is causing fibromyalgia, [brain stimulation] is not reaching the cause of whatever may lead to dysfunction in brain plasticity,” he said. The stimulation “is trying to balance the plasticity, trying to create an environment to better decrease pain, but whatever is causing it is still there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/"&gt;Dr. Rodrigo Machado-Vieira&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatry professor at the McGovern Medical School at &lt;a href="https://www.uthouston.edu/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; UTHealth Houston&lt;/a&gt;, was lead researcher in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; involving 174 adults with moderate to severe depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: electrical brain stimulation, or inactive stimulation, which used the same device but did not provide a current. Participants were taught how to use the device at home and followed a 10-week course of treatment. Those who received the electrical stimulation showed significant improvements in the severity of their depression, compared to those who used the inactive device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira said some patients respond better to electrical versus magnetic stimulation, and vice-versa, but researchers still don’t understand why. One benefit of electrical rather than magnetic, however, is that the electrical devices being tested now are much smaller and lighter than the magnetic ones typically only used in doctors’ offices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira and other scientists said getting federal regulators to approve small electrical stimulation devices that can be used at home would make the treatment more widely accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“In terms of convenience for people who live far away, or who cannot travel to sessions at the clinic, that’s a clear advantage of the [electrical devices], but that doesn’t mean that they are going to respond better to that,” compared to magnetic stimulation, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira also said brain stimulation alone, without medications, is probably not powerful enough to treat major depression. But he understands as a clinician who has long treated patients, that some just won’t stick with their medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; “Psychiatric medications have some level of stigma,” he said. “There are some groups of patients who really are not willing to take antidepressants and would benefit from this [brain stimulation] type of intervention.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

In 2019, there were over 9,000 cases, up from less than 1,000 cases reported each year in 2000. The spike has alarmed researchers and health officials since it appears that cases might continue to climb in the years to come as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Valley Fever? Here's what we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus that causes Valley Fever, sometimes called coccidioidomycosis or “cocci,” develops in the soil in various areas of California and other southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both humans and animals are susceptible to the Valley Fever, and it is transmitted via airborne spores that are inhaled into the lungs. It causes respiratory symptoms like fever, coughing, chest pain, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/unsettled-cdc-shooter-patrick-joseph-white-was-armed-with-five-firearms-report-101754789178438.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes untreated due to its symptoms' resemblance to those of other respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia and even COVID. As a result, some patients may receive poor treatment or have delays in receiving the proper care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/google-issues-red-alert-as-new-cyber-attack-targets-gmail-users-using-ai-with-indirect-prompt-injections-101755600288240.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’"&gt;Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people may inhale the spores and not become unwell, while others are prone to acquire a more serious sickness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are particularly susceptible include pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, people over 60, people with diabetes, and people who work in construction or other jobs where they are frequently exposed to dust and dirt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per the CDC, 1 percent of individuals who contract Valley Fever may experience an infection that expands from their lungs to other parts of their body, including their skin, bones, joints, or brain, and 5 to 10 percent may experience severe or permanent lung difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many patients can recover on their own in a few weeks or months without therapy, some may need treatment, hospitalisation and antifungal medication for more severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, it stemmed from investigators' conclusively linking an earlier death to the disease. The city said 108 people had been sickened, up from 101 reported on Friday, and 14 remained hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="eu1o8"&gt;The update follows word from the city last week that 12 water cooling towers in Central Harlem, scattered across 10 properties, had tested positive for Legionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia. Legionella is spread by water droplets and vapors from contaminated water towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7l1do"&gt;Several of the properties are connected with government operations, including Harlem Hospital, at 506 Lenox Ave., the city disclosed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2j6uh"&gt;Among the 10 locations, all but one had cooling towers that were either behind on required Legionella testing or had not been inspected by the city in the past year, according to a Gothamist analysis of city data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ab7p"&gt;The city said Monday that all 12 towers had been remediated. The officials have not yet stated whether bacteria discovered at those towers had been linked to the ongoing infections. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a statement that the city was still awaiting the results of DNA sequencing. She said the fifth Legionnaires' death occurred "before mid-August."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2g5bm"&gt;Jory Lange, a lawyer who said he represents 37 people who have contracted the disease in the current outbreak, called the death toll “shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="33mpq"&gt;“The building owners need to be held to account for this,” Lange said. “Legionnaires’ disease is completely preventable. None of this had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bna2j"&gt;City officials said last week that the outbreak was on the wane, though they expected new illnesses to be reported as people became aware of the outbreak and sought medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="810vh"&gt;The city passed a law in 2015 requiring all building owners to register their water cooling towers, and to put in place a maintenance plan to prevent and control the growth of Legionella and inspect and test cooling towers at least every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="276f4"&gt;The regulatory changes came after the worst outbreak in city history that year sickened more than 130 people and caused 16 deaths. In the 2022 outbreak, five people also died. Each year, on average, hundreds of cases of Legionnaires’ disease are reported. Last year, 257 New Yorkers were diagnosed with the disease. In 2018, the number topped 650.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="36fh0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was updated with additional information from the city.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPZGNDYTVEemE2SlV0TVVPVzFSMDVZaDFLRTk4akNkRTN3ZnQ1U2JucWxMRnNLcWpQVmpmRExSVmI4Mk5kMFNhRE92ZWpDQTV6YVh1bEJabE5zdUxvVmZFcXNEb2pJQVRpTlJzQ2hmMGdjM28yd3dhdV9uSVBNbDM3UnljUXdlU0Q1R0V0VFpWOGU</guid></item><item><title>大脑尸检揭示了阿尔茨海默氏症背后的潜在罪魁祸首- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNbTdzdFJjenNjT2xkbHIxa0hMS0tZSGVPMmNkRjlmd21vOGE0WlFIM1d2eUktU1N0OERudXdqUEdTU0o2TXcxUThGM05nRmRMZFRoMHN4bmlDQXZTZkFMNmFJYzNIV1VtTFJFMDZmQkh3RXpxZnNaNUNGTjhWUWV2TUxweWF1UGhwM2swUkxiMVNGSmpSeVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg" alt="Photomicrograph of microglia from a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease." class="size-full wp-image-103339" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-589x415.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photomicrograph of microglia (green) from a brain affected by Alzheimer's.

So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;Alzheimer's Breakthrough: Lithium Reverses Memory Loss in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00424-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Early detection is essential to understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with this species.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native to East Asia, UMaine says the Asian longhorned tick was first confirmed in the United States in New Jersey in 2017 and has since spread through more than 20 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most ticks, female Asian longhorned ticks can reproduce without mating, creating infestations from a single individual and posing a unique challenge for control, according to UMaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tick found in Maine was at a juvenile stage that can’t reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feed on a wide range of hosts, including livestock, pets, wildlife and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other regions, UMaine says they have been shown to transmit the cattle pathogen Theileria orientalis, which can cause significant illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is ongoing to understand if this tick species can spread the pathogens found in Maine and elsewhere in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the recent finding, state and research partners are intensifying monitoring efforts to determine whether the Asian longhorned tick is persistent in Maine and, if so, to understand its potential spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry recommends these preventative measures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use tick preventatives: Veterinarians should advise on effective treatments for livestock and pets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct rigorous tick checks: Examine animals, especially ears, eyes, tails, and feet, regularly and remove any ticks found promptly and safely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain the landscape: Keep yards and pastures brush-free and create mulch or gravel borders to reduce tick habitat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“If you find an unusual-looking tick or suspect an infestation, don’t hesitate to report it to DACF,” said Dr. Rachael Fiske, assistant state veterinarian. “In this and every instance, early detection is key to protecting Maine’s livestock, pets, wildlife and public health.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report findings or for more information, contact the Maine DACF’s Animal Health Division at (207) 287-3701 or email &lt;a href="mailto:animalhealth.dacf@maine.gov" target="_blank" title="mailto:animalhealth.dacf@maine.gov" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;animalhealth.dacf@maine.gov&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPFO</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:51:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNU0dfTno0S0xOV0IyYlNSSU1ibEhKNXc0cU5fQ3VpLWhyT05KcmRzdEltdGtpTktwT1BWVE1odzF5WWVTVllwaG1ZZzdyU21JMFFWakpGZWwyLWZvVmRURGRsZVRZSWtyQ0NBeG5nR3NTaDFfZGZiQVFadDAxUWZ3NDVadGJWekRJNy14cm1udkRrM2V4N2NjUklEUmJDVnZRbTJJRFJURUlfU1Y3QWtaNnZHLTE1UHpJcldzZ0dZaUpWcFlzSnJCdkcwd3FRdVA2M1pRdkt2aEk1ZDBlQlZlZ0NwcHg5NlZIMHNQQnVjMTJtUGpUVGg1dEFLb2RudFA5V1BWSEhYYkNYY0QxemNtTFhJR21QcDhlMEZDMEljZzA1V2Z3RkxJRFJyUHp6Z1E</guid></item><item><title>美国儿科医生的新冠肺炎疫苗建议与美国疾控中心的建议不同- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPcWJQU3hZMmRNejI3dGRHOVVMNG5DdEJ0UHNWbTBZNmRSYi1PeDJGODl0WEk1WDhYVUliRFV1RHZEclZFS3cxQlZiaHJGN2dSaWFWNElmYjJSZllFUE41RENtWGJlYWJWT2JFUmdzR0pJazBlY0VDd0ZjZjRpcnR6eFFTSFVxTGFyX3ZyWVZQUUVYNWxSZlRYMXZOajZuSTA1Zk9vc0RlYUcwYXZ6dk16T3RxSHpWcTl4QWZjZG8xQdIBVkFVX3lxTFBsVFNkelRjZ0dTWlRJZk9RTHpkajdXVWx3WmhPN2JRVHN1YkhvdW82YUZzUGlyWVYyN2U1RElTV0RPR1RLcGdvemY5U2huSGtIVlBCc1lR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c0526" class="body-graf"&gt;For the first time in 30 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics is substantially diverging from U.S. government vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8de6aa" class="body-graf"&gt;The group’s new Covid-19 recommendations — released Tuesday — come amid a tumultuous year for public health, as vaccine skeptics have come into power in the new Trump administration and government guidance has become increasingly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a795b" class="body-graf"&gt;This isn’t going to help, acknowledged Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the AAP infectious disease committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59685f" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is going to be somewhat confusing.

Kennedy Jr., which doesn’t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a4952" class="body-graf"&gt;Children ages 6 months to 2 years are at high risk for severe illness from Covid-19, and it was important that recommendations continue to emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated, said Campbell, a University of Maryland infectious diseases expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74895e" class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccinations also are recommended for older children who have chronic lung diseases or other conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, the AAP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a93b3" class="body-graf"&gt;The 95-year-old Itasca, Illinois-based organization has issued vaccination recommendations for children since the 1930s. In 1995, it synced its advice with recommendations made by the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a57dd6" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been a few small differences between AAP and CDC recommendations since then. For example, the AAP has advised that children get HPV vaccinations starting at age 9; the CDC says that’s OK but has emphasized vaccinations at ages 11 and 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a45de" class="body-graf"&gt;But in 30 years, this is the first time the recommendations have differed “in a significant or substantial way,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-ad5614"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg" alt="Large Scale Layoffs Begin At Center For Disease Control In Atlanta"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;People demonstrate outside the main campus of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on April 1 in Atlanta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Elijah Nouvelage / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-995ecf" class="body-graf"&gt;Until recently, the CDC — following recommendations by infectious disease experts — has been urging annual Covid-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06e8c3" class="body-graf"&gt;But in May, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the CDC issued language that healthy children &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;may&lt;/a&gt; get the shots, but that there was no longer a “should” recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18042f" class="body-graf"&gt;The idea that healthy older kids may be able to skip Covid-19 boosters has been brewing for some time among public health experts.

Among the options the panel was considering was whether suggest shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5240b" class="body-graf"&gt;But Kennedy bypassed the group, and also decided to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;dismiss&lt;/a&gt; the 17-member panel and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;appoint&lt;/a&gt; his own, smaller panel, that included vaccine skeptics.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to improve your heart health and lower your cholesterol levels, there’s one habit that should be at the top of your list—adding more fiber to your diet. Not only is fiber essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestive health&lt;/a&gt;, but it also plays an important role in lowering cholesterol, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and supporting your overall well-being. The trouble is, most of us aren’t getting enough. In the U.S., only about 5% of men and 9% of women meet their daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we’ll explore the many benefits of fiber, how it &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-underrated-nutrient-for-heart-health-11788119" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;helps to lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and practical tips to incorporate more of it into your meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber can have a powerful impact on cholesterol levels, especially in the way it interacts with the digestive system. The two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble, play a key role in supporting heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Binds to Cholesterol and Removes It from the Body &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://www.theleangreenbean.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Lindsay Livingston, RD&lt;/a&gt;, consuming &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;more soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of foods like oats, beans, lentils, vegetables and fruits like apples and bananas, can help lower cholesterol. “The soluble fiber binds with the cholesterol in your digestive tract, preventing it from being absorbed into your bloodstream,” says Livingston. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This process helps to lower LDL cholesterol, often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, which is a key contributor to plaque buildup in the arteries. In fact, studies found that a higher intake of soluble fiber significantly reduced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-11784141" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; in adults, confirming that even moderate increases in daily fiber intake can support cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut microbiome, which consists of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-time-to-take-probiotics-supplements-11754743" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;trillions of bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, plays an important role in the breakdown of cholesterol. A diet rich in fiber promotes a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which can help regulate cholesterol levels.&lt;a href="https://wholesomenutritionco.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The bacteria then produce short-chain fatty acids, which help reduce cholesterol production in the liver, promoting proper fat digestion and absorption.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By fostering a healthy gut microbiome, fiber supports overall metabolic health, which is essential for managing cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of cardiovascular disease, and it can also lead to elevated cholesterol levels. Eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can help to fight inflammation, reducing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that the polyphenols found in those fiber-rich plant foods have anti-inflammatory effects that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By managing inflammation, fiber helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietitians love fiber for lowering cholesterol, there are other diet and lifestyle changes that can also support heart health:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Incorporate more healthy fats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Juliana Crimi, RD, M.H.Sc.&lt;/a&gt;, suggests choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fat-for-heart-health-8644218" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in foods such as olive oil, nuts, seeds and avocados, and limiting saturated and trans fats to help improve cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://bettrfull.com/about.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Randazzo, M.A., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, exercise raises HDL (“good”) cholesterol, which helps clear LDL from the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars.&lt;/strong&gt; Holzum recommends reducing the amount of sugar and processed carbohydrates in your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily, and men should get 38 grams of fiber per day.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some practical tips for adding more fiber to your meals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Start the day with fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; Begin your morning with a fiber-rich breakfast, such as oatmeal topped with fruit, chia seeds and a handful of nuts, or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-chia-seed-smoothies-11790592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber smoothie&lt;/a&gt; made with leafy greens, berries and flaxseed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and whole-wheat bread instead of refined grains. These foods contain more fiber and are beneficial for lowering cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating more fiber is one of the best ways to lower your cholesterol,” says&lt;a href="https://cravingsomethinghealthy.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Anne Danahy, M.S., RDN.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a simple, sustainable change that can provide immediate and long-term heart-health benefits. While increasing fiber is a powerful step, combining it with other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-habits-for-summer-11766478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;, such as regular physical activity, limiting saturated and trans fats, and maintaining a balanced diet, can enhance your results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make fiber a lasting habit, start by gradually adding it to meals and snacks, experimenting with different fiber-rich foods, and pairing them with foods you already enjoy. Over time, these small, consistent changes can become second nature, helping you protect your heart and improve your overall diet quality.&lt;br&gt;

            The American Academy of Pediatrics released its &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aap.org%2Fen%2Fnews-room%2Fnews-releases%2Faap%2F2025%2Fthe-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7Cffbd27b3b35e417d6dda08dddf11a605%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638911989218166370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=OpQkMSJUt%2B%2BAKMJ5V1LCiVfWPbWRe8Z6RERfS%2FBr64E%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;updated recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines on Tuesday, including Covid-19 shots for infants and young children – a break from the current US for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations.

            “It differs from recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, which was overhauled this year and replaced with individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation,” the AAP said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeiggmn400063b6o5az2tsql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP recommendations are more explicit. It says that all children ages 6 through 23 months should receive a Covid-19 vaccine unless they have known allergies to the vaccine or its ingredients. It also recommends a single dose of the vaccine for children ages 2 through 18 years if they are at high risk of Covid-19, residents of long-term care facilities, have never been vaccinated against Covid-19, or live in a household with people who are high risk for Covid-19. It also says that the vaccine should be available for this age group even if they are in these risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite these recommendations, access to the vaccine may be difficult in the fall. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it may &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F05%2F20%2Fhealth%2Fcovid-vaccine-fda-changes&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7Cffbd27b3b35e417d6dda08dddf11a605%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638911989218201946%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=VnGdVzBzo07iQaLrNc4CG5GTzIQdJLiBz68B1SD4Xl4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;limit future Covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; to older people and those who are at high risk for serious infection, and &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F08%2F12%2Fhealth%2Fcovid-vaccine-children-pfizer-fda&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7Cffbd27b3b35e417d6dda08dddf11a605%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638911989218215861%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=oGcPorswglyL2LG00zHpLhKu1wpEx5hrWQ2jOs2qMQQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;may not renew authorization&lt;/a&gt; for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children younger than 5 years old.

            The AAP also issued updated recommendations for RSV and flu vaccines, in addition to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585?_gl=1*u0z6d4*_ga*MjEyMDI1ODA1OS4xNzUyODU4MjU1*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU1OTg3MDUkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDA2NDMkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjEyNDY3NzExOS4xNzUyODU4MjU0*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU1OTg3MDUkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTU1OTg3NDYkajE5JGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;more than 10 other vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.

            “The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents,” AAP President Dr. Susan J. Kressly in the said in the news release. “Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families and their communities healthy and thriving.”

These supplements promised to do everything from reducing wrinkles, to maintaining focus, to keeping your gut biome intact. But how much of that is true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to Anahad O’Conner, health columnist at the Washington Post, supplements can be a mixed bag. But despite the dubious evidence behind some of them, a lot of us are taking these pills and potions. “The best statistics we have show that at least 60 percent of people in the United States alone use dietary supplements,” he said. “And that’s just one supplement or more. I know one doctor who had told a story of a patient who was taking 121 supplements in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;How do we navigate the dizzying world of supplements?

And scientists will say, “Okaym we need to figure out what doses we should be telling people to take and how often to take these supplements.” They’ve then found people who take these supplements actually develop side effects and are more likely to develop cancer or heart disease, prostate cancer, things like that, and have been shocked. In fact, what we know is that it’s the dose that makes the poison. We need some level of vitamins and nutrients, of course, but taking more and more and more is often not good for your health and can cause a lot of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, why are we allowed to take them? How come the FDA isn’t stepping in? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To put it mildly, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/16/experts-debate-do-we-need-tougher-regulation-of-dietary-supplements/"&gt;dietary supplements are very loosely regulated&lt;/a&gt; in this country. They’re treated almost like they’re just food, because they are nutrients that come from food, but then they’re purified and concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Decades ago, the supplement industry pushed for this law called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which basically created what many critics call the Wild West of the supplement industry. Supplement makers can make all sorts of health claims. They can say that their supplement or their vitamin supports immune health, cardiovascular health, skin health — all these sorts of vague claims. They don’t have to undergo clinical trials where they’re tested to find out what doses are safe, what the side effects are, if they actually work or not for what’s claimed. And the FDA really can’t do anything once they’re on the market, unless there are reports of severe side effects. Right now, there are an estimated 90,000 different dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These companies don’t have to register their products at all with the FDA. The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, in fact, you and I can easily create our own supplement company in five minutes. You can just create a website, get some powder, put it in a capsule, and start marketing your supplement. You don’t have to do any studies or notify any agency. You can just start marketing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we should talk about a few of these supplements. Should we be taking those daily multivitamins? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are eating a healthy diet, then it’s very unlikely that you actually need a multivitamin. Although there have been some studies showing benefits. For example, in older adults, it’s been shown that taking a daily multivitamin could potentially help with memory loss, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another thing everyone talks about is gut health. People say it can impact more than just your stomach. Should we be taking probiotics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Probiotics are basically any bacteria or microbe that confers health benefits. You want a diverse community of gut microbes. You want a healthy ecosystem. But if you take a probiotic in capsule or pill form, what happens is that oftentimes they contain a limited number of species of bacteria in very concentrated mega-doses that can throw off the balance of your gut microbial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Probiotics are good for you, and you can get them from fermented foods. So, you think about things like sauerkraut, kimchi, Greek yogurt, for example. Humans have been consuming fermented foods for thousands of years, and they contain these healthy live microbes. If you’re just taking the probiotics in capsule or pill form, there can be side effects, and you can actually reduce the diversity of your gut microbiome rather than enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a couple of more supplements to ask you about. One is collagen. I admit that I bought some back when my favorite influencer at the time was putting it in her macha lattes, and now it’s sitting there gathering dust on my coffee bar. Should we be taking it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;No, I don’t think so. I haven’t seen any convincing studies that show any benefits of taking collagen supplements. That is something that I would not particularly waste money on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;Unless you have a documented, demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about creatine? Who should be taking this beyond your gym bros who are trying to get buff? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creatine has been around for a while, and there have been a lot of studies on its benefits. It’s something that you can obtain naturally from food, particularly meat. And there have been studies showing that when you take a creatine supplement in combination with resistance training, then you can get some benefits from that. Particularly, it’ll help you grow bigger and stronger, but the benefits are not extraordinary. It might help you gain a few extra reps out of your bench press or your squat, for example. What they have also shown is that if you’re just taking creatine and not lifting weights, then you’re not going to see any benefits from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s been a lot of health claims that it can improve your cognitive health, help with dementia. There haven’t been any real good studies demonstrating that. That’s not to say that it’s not true, just that it hasn’t really been shown conclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any final thoughts on supplements? Should we be as invested in them as we are? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I am not anti-supplement. I still take some supplements here and there.

I always tell people, unless you have a documented demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet just by eating a lot of healthy whole foods, which is what human beings have been doing for millennia and has always worked. If you’re going to take supplements, be really careful about which ones you’re taking, make sure that you actually need it, that you’re actually getting benefits, and don’t just believe what the industry wants you to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPOVJ5RDM2S1BHbjNqZzVyTHVLX1dhYzF6TEZGeFJ6T29JdnAxR0QwTkgtdmVjdDFWUE1GOTRBdzJxNGVnVXk1dEhLUndzdU1jLXlmYUU0MnhTMWktSHg0SVFmMUFtUTdZMjZDZGRzRUR2bGdlaTVac2Y1WnNPejZZbEJ3d0xxSHFMZ3Y1SWFzeWppTWxGOUE</guid></item><item><title>我们是整形外科医生—我们永远不会忽视这7个危险信号- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNQnhLaFMtVEJJdDlDc2NjaWJod1FfSUY5U09SdFFjc3FkdUl0a243Ulg5SWNYYjFNbEVsZXhaOV9rMDA3MlA1SDN1M1NoUzdTUXFxUUloQk92MkF4UkpHTjk4cWU3OWEtSHhaV2tQVVVqc0dHS05PVl9STV85LVFBVDdGN25TaUpZdDBHOTZxSXZGZEV5cGlKNzY2SFHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUDFoZXdKbUVkS004UXpiVGVSTjZjWG03akVuUmgxV3JyOERHMlJ2elc1U3Z6V1NUVndrdGd6eW5uVS1zelJpd2N4UXo0Tk5USm5kWnUwTlRucXJkQWp3MHpIQ1NLSmg2d3YxQUJUQk1NOEx2QjlZM2JHVGhpVkowblNPb3NNRUczaHVfZHZtSDZZcExDVm8wR3JRT01KVlFlRUd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When considering plastic surgery, selecting the right doctor is just as important as choosing the procedure itself.

Your surgeon is not board-certified in plastic surgery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s essential to confirm that a surgeon is board-certified — and not just in any specialty, but specifically in plastic surgery. “This credential affirms they have completed rigorous training and examinations,” explained Murphy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, some doctors may market themselves as plastic surgeons without holding the proper certification. “This happens more commonly than you think and is not illegal, though it is unethical,” said Gould. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Hesh Hipp via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Hesh Hipp via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A "cosmetic surgeon" isn't the same as being a board-certified plastic surgeon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the doctor’s residency was in a non-plastic-surgery field like pediatrics, colorectal surgery, or even dermatology, “there’s a problem,” said Gould, who pointed out that the term “cosmetic surgeon” is often used in these cases, and although it sounds legitimate, it’s not the same as being a board-certified plastic surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Your surgeon should be held to the standards of a board such as the American Board of Plastic Surgery or American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, to ensure your safety and outcome,” said Sturm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Your surgeon doesn’t specialize in the procedure you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sturm advises patients to choose someone who specializes in the specific surgery they’re considering. This usually means the surgeon has performed the procedure more frequently, pursued deeper training, and kept up with relevant advancements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are so many great surgeons, but just because they are amazing at one procedure doesn’t mean they will be at all of them,” she noted. Pursuing a specialist means you’re more likely to see consistent results and benefit from a provider who knows how to handle complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When selecting a plastic surgeon, “always inquire about their experience with the specific procedure you’re considering,” advised Murphy. Furthermore, you’ll want to “verify that your surgery will take place in an accredited facility, and make sure that pre-operative clearance is required.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They don’t have lots of before-and-after photos to show you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before-and-after photos can provide valuable insight into a surgeon’s skills, aesthetic style, and the kind of results you can reasonably expect. “Ask how many similar surgeries they have performed and request before-and-after photos of their work,” suggested Murphy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If they have pages and pages of breast augmentations, but not many rhinoplasties, they may be a great surgeon, but more than likely don’t do as many rhinoplasties,” noted Sturm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, Murphy cautioned patients to have realistic expectations. “A competent surgeon will not promise you perfection, as it simply isn’t achievable,” he said. “A qualified surgeon will provide feedback and input to make sure your expectations are achievable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The price is unusually low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Be cautious of prices that seem too enticing,” warned Murphy, as this may indicate cut corners and come with hidden risks. “Many patients have come to me for revisions after being unhappy with low-cost procedures that didn’t turn out well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You feel any pressure to proceed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trust your instincts. If you feel pressured or manipulated, “this is a psychological form of gaslighting that has no place in medicine and certainly not in plastic surgery,” said Gould. “If your surgeon tries to scare you into a procedure, saying that if you go elsewhere, you will be butchered or that it will cost you dearly, this is another red flag.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you ever feel uneasy about a situation, it’s perfectly acceptable to graciously excuse yourself,” said Murphy. “It’s critical to feel at ease before undergoing any procedure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If at any time — even in the operating room right before the procedure — you feel like it’s wrong, it is always OK to say ‘stop,’” added Gould. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. There’s no wait time to schedule the surgery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Availability can be another indicator of quality. “If your surgeon can do the surgery tomorrow, that’s not a good sign,” noted Gould. “Most skilled surgeons are booked out at least three months in advance, and there is a standardized process to lead up to the surgery, including adequate time for medical clearance, life planning, aftercare and travel. If your surgeon isn’t busy and booked, then that’s a red flag.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. They actively upsell you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a consultation starts to feel more like a sales pitch, it’s a sign the surgeon may not be acting in your best interest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you go to a plastic surgeon, you are coming to address things about yourself that may make you self-conscious. You want to find a surgeon who helps you address those and feel more confident, not find more things to worry about,” explained Sturm, who noted that many of her revision patients were sold into procedures they didn’t originally seek. “They weren’t that worried about that area of their face in the first place but [were] talked into surgery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the consultation feels off in any way, “I would politely complete the consultation and continue my search for the right plastic surgeon,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNQnhLaFMtVEJJdDlDc2NjaWJod1FfSUY5U09SdFFjc3FkdUl0a243Ulg5SWNYYjFNbEVsZXhaOV9rMDA3MlA1SDN1M1NoUzdTUXFxUUloQk92MkF4UkpHTjk4cWU3OWEtSHhaV2tQVVVqc0dHS05PVl9STV85LVFBVDdGN25TaUpZdDBHOTZxSXZGZEV5cGlKNzY2SFHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUDFoZXdKbUVkS004UXpiVGVSTjZjWG03akVuUmgxV3JyOERHMlJ2elc1U3Z6V1NUVndrdGd6eW5uVS1zelJpd2N4UXo0Tk5USm5kWnUwTlRucXJkQWp3MHpIQ1NLSmg2d3YxQUJUQk1NOEx2QjlZM2JHVGhpVkowblNPb3NNRUczaHVfZHZtSDZZcExDVm8wR3JRT01KVlFlRUd3</guid></item><item><title>从胃瘫痪到视力丧失： Ozempic面临超过20亿美元的诉讼-商业标准</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="parent_top_div"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic, the diabetes drug turned global weight-loss phenomenon, is under intense legal and medical scrutiny. Once promoted as a breakthrough drug and a safe shortcut to shedding kilos, this injectable is facing over $2 billion in lawsuits in the US, with patients reporting severe side effects ranging from stomach paralysis to vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why is Ozempic getting sued?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist originally designed for diabetes, shot to global fame when celebrities and social media influencers started using it for slimming down. Social media feeds were flooded with “before and after” reels, driving demand worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But lawsuits are piling up. According to lawsuittracker.org, more than 1,200 GLP-1 lawsuits have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-face-teeth-tongue-side-effects-weight-loss-drugs-125052600597_1.html?1755598377" target="_blank"&gt;Patients reported conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; such as gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), vomiting, and vision problems, alleging that Novo Nordisk failed to provide adequate warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The website of the Law Offices of Melinda J Helbock, a San Diego-based firm, notes that the total liability could exceed $2 billion, with numbers expected to rise further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What does Novo Nordisk have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Helbock's website, Novo Nordisk continues to deny wrongdoing, stating that Ozempic is safe when used as directed. However, plaintiffs argue that the company failed to fully disclose the risks, especially for its off-label use in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company insists Ozempic is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for diabetes only and that labels already warn about gastrointestinal side effects. They argue that off-label weight loss use has exploded beyond its intended scope, thanks to social media hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But legal experts say the $2 billion lawsuits could be just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all users face severe side effects. Many have lost weight successfully without major issues. But experts warn that, as evident from multiple reports of side effects, short-term gains may come with long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What doctors advise for current users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all users face severe side effects, and many have reported successful weight loss without major issues. Still, experts caution that short-term gains may carry long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doctors recommend that those already using Ozempic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Schedule regular check-ups for gut health and vision&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Report persistent nausea, vomiting, or changes in eyesight&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consider lifestyle-based weight-loss methods as safer, long-term alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic is not a magic wand for weight loss. While it can help shed kilos quickly—fueling its popularity—it comes with risks. The mounting billion-dollar lawsuits underscore a wider lesson: in the battle against weight, there is no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquoteBG styleQ1"&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the routine annual vaccine review and approval process has become clouded with doubt and uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado hasn’t waited for the air to clear. Colorado lawmakers &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1027"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year along party lines, later signed into law by the governor, which directs the state’s board of health to &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/18/new-colorado-law-vaccine-recommendations-rfk-jr-cdc/"&gt;take into consideration&lt;/a&gt; recommendations from other high-profile doctors' groups, not just the CDC panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;ACIP&lt;/a&gt; — whose membership was overhauled under RFK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes come after vaccine policy became more controversial during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood immunization rates have &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/show-segment/new-study-gives-a-shot-in-the-arm-to-declining-toddler-vaccination-rates/"&gt;fallen in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, below where &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/"&gt;experts would suggest&lt;/a&gt; for broad community protection. With back-to-school season here and the respiratory virus season approaching, many questions are swirling about new policies and recommendations, CPR Health Reporter John Daley interviewed a key Colorado decision-maker: &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-department-of-public-health-and-environment-names-dr-ned-calonge-new-chief"&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator"&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-group has-layout-flex has-orientation-vertical article__contained"&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Daley: I wonder if you could give folks an update on where things stand with fall vaccines. I would imagine you're getting a lot of questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We've been getting questions from vaccine providers, and we expect there will be enough vaccines for everyone who wants one this coming season. The supplies for vaccines are managed nationally, and we know providers across the state have already placed orders to assure availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;Ed Andrieski/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption"&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge, right, Colorado's acting chief medical officer, during a news conference in Denver, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2002. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Is there confusion about the schedule, as it's normally done, coming from the federal government with the new administration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the key area of confusion has been the COVID vaccine recommendation for pregnant persons. We are continuing to recommend a vaccine for that group as protective against COVID during pregnancy. The latest version of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;ACIP&lt;/a&gt; (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations was just silent on that previous recommendation, and there's been no new evidence of issues of safety in that population. So, we're telling providers that our recommendation is to continue to follow the recommendation as it was in place in January of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: So that would be essentially relying on the guidance from the former vaccine panel? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge: &lt;/strong&gt; Yes. The one additional issue is that the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/?srsltid=AfmBOop8iKHT1qQgzyhNAkWjvsTM91souW4TVAjoJAZwCdS-thRKP9lP"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; is working on putting forward their authoritative vaccine schedule, so that there's an updated authoritative schedule for providers and states to base their decision-making on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: When do you expect that'll be out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Great question. And I don't have the answer to that. I know that they're actively working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; And does that tie in with the state law that the legislature passed this past session that gives the state and the Board of Health the option of following guidance from some of these other high-profile medical groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; That's correct. So the legislation said we could bring in recommendations from other evidence and science-based authoritative bodies, both nationally and internationally, as we set our schedule and as the &lt;a href="https://doi.colorado.gov/"&gt;Division of insurance&lt;/a&gt; sets their funding requirements for insurers in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Let's talk a little bit about flu and RSV vaccines. Has the CDC signed off on those for this fall yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The only change in the flu vaccine is the elimination of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html#:~:text=Thimerosal%20is%20added%20to%20vials,process%20to%20prevent%20germ%20growth."&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mercury-containing preservative. The last place that had been used was in multi-dose vials for flu vaccine. What the manufacturers have done is take the thimerosal out and moved all of their production to single-dose prefilled syringes. So there is no thimerosal in any other vaccine in the United States. And so this move will take thimerosal out of all vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It seems like the biggest questions are still out there about COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The schedule continues to have the vaccine recommended but with shared decision-making. So the provider would say, ‘Here's the vaccine, here's what we know about benefits, here's what we know about harms.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that's the way we think you should do vaccines all the time. That it's a choice issue for individuals to decide whether or not they wanna be immunized. It has full approval for use in people 65 years and older. That's the Moderna product, and then 6 months to 64 years, if you have an underlying condition putting you at high risk. And then this issue about the availability or the ability to provide shared decision making. So one of the things that is swirling around is whether or not the FDA will undo Pfizer's EUA (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;) for the pediatric COVID vaccines. That one goes down to four months, and if they don't have that emergency use authorization, then Moderna will be the vaccine that we have available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: A lot of people are wondering if they'll be able to get COVID vaccines this fall. And this would be not just for kids, but also adults that want to get them. What would you say to people who have those questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We have adequate supply for this coming fall of COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:  Will it be the latest updated COVID vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it's the one that we have now, and it's the one that we would continue to use based on what we're seeing in terms of COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: That's even if they don't give approval to Pfizer, there will still be the Moderna version?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: What's your main message for Coloradans about all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns article__contained"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-pullquote__blockquote"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-pullquote__quote"&gt;The most effective way to prevent these infections during the upcoming fall — we're talking about influenza, RSV and COVID-19 — is to be immunized. The shots are safe and effective. There are adverse reactions, but they're very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wp-block-pullquote__cite"&gt;Ned Calonge&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The message remains the same... On the whole, when you look at the trade-off between your risk of getting disease — which is still out there for COVID-19, comes back every year, for flu, and now we have new tools against RSV — the best protection is to be immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: And what would you like Coloradans to understand about this new state law that's now in effect that gives the state Board of Health the option of following recommendations from these other high-profile medical groups? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it's important to know that what Colorado's done with legislation is to be able to continue our role to share science-based information from a range of these respective public health experts so that Coloradans can make informed health decisions. So that they can make their decisions based on what a range of different experts say. Especially as we've seen changes in the federal panel for the ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like that protects Coloradans and will give them an additional level of safety looking down the road?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; It's my strong feeling this gives Coloradans additional choice to protect their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: Have you heard of any pushback from the Health and Human Services department on that, or do you anticipate any?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We haven't had any pushback at this point, and I'm always reticent to make predictions, especially about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOYU1qY2xHWTNUMEtTekpJZ2daVE5TVkJqcEl5UmZyWDNGVEhxWkYtRFhaSkVMR3hhM0R5cDE2bFZfX3BjV1lVcG5UZ0hYLWVlMjJkX3RpWU9CSnVpRE43ZnpIajJwQUVQNWdhQWVKcGRjR2JxX0VyUEJBUHNVakZSNmNJQQ</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生分享在您的抗衰老护肤程序中不可使用的护肤品以及实际有效的护肤品-非常简单</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOMW9Qb0JfT09xRFRXMjc2Z25Nekh2S0pTbW9NaDBaUExuN3FmaXlhUVR3TXYzWWtvSWVGanF4WEg1ODNRMmRMV2hYaWpZd1dlajRmdlh1NnZ3cmtoWE0wUlFHd2ZvTHY3azhoWTZEMFBBdDQ0eGNJR0doa1d4R1JWYjJ4NFFMT1lIMGdaNG14ZWxHazdkZ0hpZ19iekJjdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to establishing a daily anti-aging skincare routine, it may not be clear where you should start.

She shared her seven go-to products under $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;node=205662310011&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to treat these issues, including CeraVe moisturizing cream, La Roche-Posay serum, EltaMd sunscreen, and RoC retinol cream.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Harsh physical scrubs can create micro-tears in the skin, according to Dr. Engelman, which causes irritation and long-term sensitivity. She explained that polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) help encourage cell turnover while maintaining skin moisture, which is key for a long-term youthful appearance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Engelman shared that alcohol-heavy toners can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupting the skin barrier and increasing dryness and irritation. “I love the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paulas-Choice-Niacinamide-Enlarged-Wrinkles-Normal/dp/B01GF1EOB8?tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster Serum&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthens the skin barrier, refines pores, and improves skin tone without stripping moisture,” she said.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Niacinamide is anti-inflammatory and, according to the doctor, “works beautifully alongside retinoids and vitamin C.” This, she shares, is because niacinamide soothes inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier, which reduces irritation from retinoids and sensitivity from vitamin C. “At the same time, it doesn’t interfere with their effects, so you get smoother cell turnover from retinoids, brightening and antioxidant protection from vitamin C, and balanced, calm skin from niacinamide.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Dr. Engelman—and most dermatologists—SPF is the single most important anti-aging product you can own. She noted that using SPF consistently slows down aging, preserves collagen, and keeps your skin healthy long-term. “Sun exposure is a primary factor of premature aging. No serum, cream, or treatment can undo consistent UV damage, but daily broad-spectrum SPF protects your skin at the source,” she explained. “It’s the foundation for every other anti-aging strategy.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while your favorite foundation with SPF might make your complexion look flawless on the surface, it might provide “insufficient sun protection, leaving skin vulnerable to UV damage and premature aging." Make sure you’re also wearing sunscreen meant for the face—tinted sunscreen, namely, offers sun protection with a little bit of color coverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “My favorite [tinted sunscreen] is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Clear-Tinted-Sunscreen-Face/dp/B00ZPWR0N8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46&lt;/a&gt;, which offers UVA/UVB and visible light protection with niacinamide and antioxidants. Niacinamide strengthens the skin and evens tone, while antioxidants neutralize free radicals from the sun and pollution, as per Dr. Engelman.

Not only can this damage your skin, but steroids can thin it, while hydroquinone can irritate or even darken skin over time (which is the opposite effect of what you desire). Azelaic acid is gentler, calms skin, lightens pigmentation, and is safe to use with most other ingredients, Dr. Engelman added. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pure coconut oil and other occlusives can be particularly problematic for acne-prone skin as the ingredients can clog pores, worsening breakouts, according to Dr. Engelman. “I love &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B000YJ2SLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;CeraVe Moisturizing Cream&lt;/a&gt;, which replenishes ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids for healthy, resilient skin without clogging pores.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ceramides are lipids naturally found in your skin that help form and maintain the skin’s barrier, she explains. A strong barrier locks in moisture, protects against irritants and pollution, and prevents dryness and sensitivity. “Using ceramides in skincare restores this barrier, keeping skin healthy, hydrated, and resilient.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent use of harsh masks can strip the skin and cause irritation rather than firming, noted Dr. Engelman. “Instead of stripping, this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Hyalu-Hyaluronic-Anti-Wrinkle-Concentrate/dp/B075VX4QVM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;La Roche-Posay serum&lt;/a&gt; deeply hydrates and plumps, temporarily reducing the appearance of fine lines and improving skin elasticity.

WTOP looks into which ones are especially important this year. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;As students head back to school, a checkup on which vaccines are needed is usually on the list. WTOP looks into which ones are especially important this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are victims of their own success,” said Dr. David Higgins, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “They have been so successful that we don’t routinely see diseases that many of our parents or grandparents saw, like polio or measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said some parents don’t want to give their children some vaccines because they haven’t heard of cases of these diseases recently and don’t believe it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As pediatricians, we went into this field because we care deeply about the health of children, and we want to partner with parents to make sure they’re making decisions that are truly informed with good information to keep their children healthy,” Higgins said of how he would persuade parents to think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the vaccines that parents should put on their list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing, across the country, outbreaks of measles, and we’re having one of our worst measles years in decades. Additionally, we’re seeing, unfortunately, outbreaks of pertussis, or whooping cough,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is very contagious, and symptoms can set in anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks after exposure, which is why doctors encourage monitoring for the illness for up to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of those cases have been extremely serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have had multiple cases where children, usually young infants, have died from whooping cough,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses could be indicative of changing attitudes toward vaccines. Nationally, the number of kindergartners getting required vaccines has dropped and the number of children with vaccine exemptions hit an all-time high. Higgins said that can be dangerous when those kids go back to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know that vaccines only keep these diseases at bay, and as soon as vaccination rates drop, it’s not a matter of if, but when, diseases like measles will come back into a community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking Language Velocity Field (LVF) method is helping researchers trace dispersion patterns of languages, including &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, across the world&lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spatial evolution of languages can help deepen our understanding of people diffusion and cultural spread. The language velocity field estimation is different from the frequently used phylogeographic approach which cannot fully explain the language evolution induced by the horizontal contact among languages, such as borrowing and areal diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of language evolution, particularly its spatial dispersion, offers valuable insights into our collective past. Traditional approaches, such as the phylogeographic approach, often miss the complexity of language evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-48-56682498" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-48-56682498" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LVF estimation is the product of a new study, published by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44430-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications &lt;/em&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. It is a computational approach that steps beyond the limitations of previous methods, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LVF incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions of language change. This distinction is crucial in multilingual regions, where languages often borrow from and influence each other, leading to a more complex evolutionary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-50-28609380" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-50-28609380" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How LVF Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Velocity Field method first creates a velocity field that shows how linguistic traits change over time, accurately capturing the essence of both horizontal contact and vertical divergence. This field is similar to the phylogenetic tree but with an expanded scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then LVF projects this field into geographic space, thereby outlining language dispersal trajectories based on linguistic relatedness and geography. This new method has been tested by simulating one thousand datasets and then being used to figure out how major agricultural language families, such as the &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2023/11/03/history-greek-language-throughout-time/"&gt;Indo-European to which the Greek language belongs&lt;/a&gt;, Sino-Tibetan, Bantu, and Arawak spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empirical application of LVF to these language families showed dispersal trajectories aligning with population movements inferred from ancient DNA and archaeological data. Moreover, the identified dispersal centers were geographically close to the ancient homelands of agricultural or Neolithic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-47-56478795" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-47-56478795" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings underscore the important role of agricultural languages in mirroring demographic and cultural spreads over the past ten thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close to the Anatolian Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study appears to align more closely with Colin Renfrew’s Anatolian hypothesis, proposed in the 1980s, for the distribution of Indo-European languages. It posits that the spread of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_mj64nrmnM"&gt;Indo-European languages&lt;/a&gt; was closely tied to the diffusion of agriculture from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) around 8,000 to 9,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-803847" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Affinity between Anatolian and Aegean languages according to the Anatolian hypothesis. The &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2021/02/08/greek-language-not-dying-merely-changing/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Greek language"&gt;Greek language&lt;/a&gt; is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages. Credit: Greek Reporter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LVF study’s results, which show that the paths of language families used in farming are similar to population movements inferred from ancient DNA and archaeological data, support the theory that language spread and agricultural growth are linked. Specifically, the LVF approach identified the dispersal center of Indo-European languages in the Fertile Crescent. It is an area closely associated with the earliest known agricultural developments and within proximity to Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest a stronger link between &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;the spread of Greek&lt;/a&gt; and other Indo-European languages and the spread of agriculture in Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach not only enriches our comprehension of linguistic development but also offers insights into broader historical narratives. It provides a more holistic view of human history. The LVF method helps unravel the complex story of human languages and their journey across time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In what sounds like the plot from a sci-fi movie, scientists have isolated an incredibly rare immune mutation to create a &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all" target="_blank"&gt;universal antiviral treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only present in a few dozen people worldwide, ISG15 immunodeficiency causes people to be more susceptible to certain bacterial illnesses, but it also grants the people with this condition immunity to known viruses. Researchers think that the constant, mild inflammation these individuals experience is at the root of the immunoresponse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where things get really interesting is how the researchers have found a way to stimulate protein production of the most beneficial 10 proteins of the 60 created by the natural mutation using 10 mRNA sequences inside a lipid nanoparticle. Lead researcher [Dusan Bogunovic] says “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses.” Researchers hope the treatment can be administered to first responders as a sort of biological Personal protective equipment (PPE) against the next pandemic since it would likely work against unknown viruses before new targeted vaccines could be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamsters and mice were given this treatment via nasal drip, but how about &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/09/29/intranasal-vaccines-a-potential-off-ramp-for-coronavirus-pandemics/"&gt;intranasal vaccines&lt;/a&gt; when it comes time for human trials?

But these days, you're likely wishing you had taken her advice. Turns out, poor posture is one of the leading causes of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/spine/patient-resources/ergonomics-prolonged-sitting" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, "Poor sitting posture and workplace ergonomics over time can damage spinal structures and contribute to recurrent episodes of neck or back pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about all the hours spent hunched over laptops, desktops and smartphones — it adds up. Maintaining good posture in these situations isn't easy, and over time it can lead to muscle imbalances, disk compression and even nerve irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the strain on your back, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt; recommends changing positions frequently, taking regular breaks, keeping your feet flat on the floor when seated and using proper back support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Teeradej - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle strains and sprains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you tweaked your back lifting a heavy box or pushed yourself a little too hard at the gym, muscle-related injuries are another major cause of back pain. A sudden awkward movement, poor lifting technique or even overuse can strain the muscles, tendons or ligaments in your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10265-back-strains-and-sprains" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of a muscle strain or sprain include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that gets worse with movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden muscle cramping or spasms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased range of motion or difficulty walking, bending or standing straight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulging or herniated disks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between each vertebra in your spine are soft disks that act as cushions. But when one of those disks bulges or herniates, pain is often not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a disk herniates, some of the cushioning material slips out of the casing that holds it. This is also called a ruptured disk or slipped disk," Shawna Seed writes for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/treatments-for-herniated-disk" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that cushioning presses on nearby nerves, it can cause pain, numbness or weakness. Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/symptoms-causes/syc-20354095" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but they can also happen in the neck — depending on which part of the spine is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, herniated disks cause no symptoms, so you may not even know you have one without proper &lt;a href="https://www.taylormedmri.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;imaging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Arthritis and degenerative conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all back pain is your fault — sometimes it's just part of getting older. As you age, the disks and joints in your spine naturally start to wear down, which can lead to chronic issues like osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis or other degenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/spinal-arthritis" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; explains that as the cartilage between the joints breaks down over time, it causes inflammation and pain. Since this kind of pain comes from physical wear and tear, it tends to flare up when you bend or twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you've had a back injury in the past, that can raise your chances of developing degenerative arthritis later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain isn't always caused by a physical injury. In many cases, stress plays a bigger role than people realize. As Traci Pedersen writes for &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/can-stress-cause-back-pain#symptoms" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, "Stress can lead to inflammation, muscle spasms, and tension in your back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with those physical reactions, stress can also reduce blood flow to your back muscles, heighten your sensitivity to pain and lead to poor posture — all of which can make back pain worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regular exercise, stretching, and good posture can help alleviate back pain, while stress management techniques like meditation and deep breathing can help reduce stress levels," Pedersen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How an MRI can help you find relief for your back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter the cause of your back pain, the key to relief is getting an accurate diagnosis — and advanced imaging can help you pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) provides a clear, detailed picture of your spine, muscles, disks and nerves. It can help identify the exact cause of your pain and guide your treatment plan — whether that's physical therapy, chiropractic care or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, waiting for insurance to cover your MRI means waiting for that pain relief. Referrals, long waits and high deductibles can all be obstacles standing in your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why more people are turning to TaylorMed MRI, Utah's go-to provider for fast, affordable and insurance-free MRI scans. At &lt;a href="https://www.taylormedmri.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;TaylorMed MRI,&lt;/a&gt; you don't need a doctor's referral.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several of the studies in the &lt;em&gt;Cureus &lt;/em&gt;review found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-ginger-8731069" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger supplements&lt;/a&gt; helped reduce &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; (the top number).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ginger-health-uses-nutrition-and-more-7487136" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ginger&lt;/a&gt; may reduce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-causes-high-ldl-bad-cholesterol-5185421" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL (“bad”) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-high-triglycerides-697535" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt;—two types of fat that can build up in the arteries and raise the risk of heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study in the review found that people with obesity who took &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/metformin-how-to-prevent-side-effects-1087301" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their cholesterol levels after taking up to 1.8 grams of ginger daily. Their triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels all dropped.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect may be due to ginger’s natural phytochemicals, such as &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; and flavonoids, which could help prevent cholesterol from forming.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger’s active components may inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver, increase bile acid secretion, and enhance the activity of enzymes that break down fats,” said Lindsay Malone, MS, RDN, LD, nutrition instructor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-helps-fight-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Helps Fight Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/11-atypical-signs-of-chronic-inflammation-5075765" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a major driver of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger is rich in phenolic compounds such as &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;gingerols&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;shogaols&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;paradols&lt;/span&gt;, which have potent anti-inflammatory effects,” said Malone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study cited in the review found that taking 2 grams of ginger daily for three months reduced inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This can happen for several reasons. “Some phytochemicals help to keep bacteria, viruses, and other microbes in check by boosting our immune system,” said Weinandy. “Others help neutralize free radicals, which can damage cells in our bodies.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-protects-against-atherosclerosis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Protects Against Atherosclerosis &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those same bioactive compounds can also produce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-antioxidants-11760827" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; effects, said Malone. Antioxidants help protect your cells, including those in your heart and blood vessels, from damage caused by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/information-about-free-radicals-2249103" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research suggests that these antioxidant effects may help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-atherosclerosis-1745908" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-supports-healthy-blood-sugar-levels"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Supports Healthy Blood Sugar Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review also suggested ginger may benefit blood sugar management, particularly in people with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-overview-4581874" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of its compounds, 6-gingerol, helps move &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/glucose-5188205" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; from your bloodstream into your muscle cells, lowering high blood sugar and improving insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one study in the review, people with type 2 diabetes who took 1,600 milligrams of ginger daily for three months saw reduced fasting blood sugar, insulin levels, and HbA1c—a marker of long-term blood sugar control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other research suggests ginger may help reduce insulin resistance, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-you-add-ginger-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Should You Add Ginger to Your Diet? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review's takeaway is promising—ginger is packed with natural compounds that support heart health in several ways. But there are a few things to keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For one, the studies in the review vary significantly in dosage, duration, population, and form of ginger—powders, extracts, and capsules—which limits standardization, Nyree Dardarian, EdD, assistant clinical professor of nutrition at Drexel University, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of that, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions about the health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, adding ginger to your routine is worth considering. You can even use fresh or powdered ginger in recipes and smoothies. If you have a health condition or take prescription medications, it's smart to check with a healthcare provider before taking a ginger supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, ginger isn't a magic bullet. "Ginger is a great addition, but it works best in the context of an overall healthy lifestyle," said Dardarian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-key-takeaways"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Key Takeaways &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ginger might seem like a simple spice, but it may be a powerful support for your heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research has linked it to benefits like reduced blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation, and plaque build-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While studies have used up to 2 grams of ginger daily, speak with your healthcare provider to ensure safe usage for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

With reports of deer that have been dead for a while, there is not viable tissue available to be tested, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Is epizootic hemorrhagic disease a threat to humans, other animals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ohio Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;advised on a web page&lt;/a&gt; that there is currently no risk in handling infected deer, eating venison from infected deer, or getting bitten by an infected midge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, the department stated that without testing the deer, it can't be known for sure what it was suffering from, so it's important to be cautious and never kill or eat a sick deer, and to wear rubber gloves to field dress a deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Epizootic hemorrhagic disease also does not pose a "serious threat" to livestock, advises the state department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Where has epizootic hemorrhagic disease been found this year so far?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-type="link" data-id="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;a map&lt;/a&gt; on the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website, the following counties have been confirmed to have epizootic hemorrhagic disease cases in 2025: Union, Morrow, Fairfield, Guernsey, Athens, Washington and Meigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The following counties have also had reports of dead or sick deer this year: Brown, Highland, Hocking, Morgan, Noble, and Monroe. This map was last updated on Aug. 12, so there are not yet reports shown in Hamilton County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In 2024, the Division of Wildlife confirmed deer deaths from hemorrhagic disease in 32 Ohio counties. A 2025 summary of Ohio's deer program shows the division received more than 400 reports, totaling more than 1,000 dead or sick dear observations in Defiance and Paulding counties with less deaths in other areas of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PCIN/85712523007-ehd-lg.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=389&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PCIN/85712523007-ehd-lg.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=778&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Map of confirmed epizootic hemorrhagic disease cases and reports of dead or sick deer in 2025 in Ohio.

It is transmitted to deer through the bite of an infected midge, a very small fly. There is currently no treatment of the disease in wild populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Symptoms vary, but can include deer appearing disoriented, showing little to no fear of humans, appearing feverish, having respiratory distress, and pronounced swelling of head, neck, tongue and eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Outbreaks happen around the time of droughts and stop after the first freeze, which kills the midges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until then, this disease has the potential to cause high rates of deer mortality particularly in the Midwest, where the deer population hasn't developed resistance to the disease. Due to this lack of resistance, Ohio deer are likely to die within three days following the start of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hemorrhagic disease is also a general term that can refer to bluetongue virus, which has similar symptoms but can pose a serious threat to livestock like sheep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If it isn't epizootic hemorrhagic disease, what else could it be?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In 2022, The Enquirer reported on &lt;a href="/story/news/2022/08/24/zombie-deer-colerain-township-ohio-dnr-reports-epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease/65417730007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/08/24/zombie-deer-colerain-township-ohio-dnr-reports-epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease/65417730007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;"zombie deer,"&lt;/a&gt; a misnomer used for two diseases that cause deer to act strangely. One was epizootic hemorrhagic disease. The other is much rarer in Ohio: chronic wasting disease. It was first found in the state in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Chronic wasting disease is not caused by a virus. It is caused by a prion, a misfolded protein. Mad cow disease, which affected cattle in the UK in the 1990s, is caused by a prion that was able to spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, there is "no strong evidence" that chronic wasting disease can spread to humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the meat of contaminated animals should not be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Deer infected with chronic wasting disease can take months to show symptoms, as opposed to a couple of weeks with epizootic hemorrhagic disease. In the late stages of the disease, deer might stagger, drool excessively and, again, show little to no fear of humans, the department stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While the disease is not common in Ohio, it has been found in free-ranging populations in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as many western states and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How to take action if you see a deer behaving strangely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ohio Division of Wildlife is asking people to report dead or sick deer so disease can be tracked throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the 2025 annual report of Ohio's deer program, the Division of Wildlife relies heavily on reports from the public to document epizootic hermorragic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;If you live in the village of Newtown, Synan recommends you call Newtown police at 513-561-7697.

Here’s a new addition: Ozempic vulva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making its turn around the social media frequently now, Ozempic vulva isn’t a medical diagnosis; rather, it’s a label coined by women noticing unexpected changes in their vulva or vaginal area after using Ozempic or similar GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is a widely used weight-loss and diabetes medication, but some women taking it are reporting surprising and sensitive side effects. These changes include sagging skin, dryness, muscle weakness, loss of fullness, altered discharge, and even pelvic weakness. While it may sound surprising, experts say these shifts are often tied to rapid weight loss, hormone shifts, and hydration changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide) is a well-known prescription drug that’s used to treat the blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is given as an injection under your skin. Ozempic is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death) in people who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration first approved the injectable medication for treating diabetes in 2017; the agency approved a drug with a higher dose of the active ingredient in Ozempic, called semaglutide, to treat obesity in 2021, under the brand name Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, talk of the drug has popped up across the internet. The prescription drug keeps gaining attention as celebrities, a tech mogul, and TikTok influencers have described taking it to lose weight in short time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic vulva?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known casually as 'Ozempic vulva' or 'Ozempic vagina', the issue refers to changes in the genital area linked to rapid weight loss. It’s not an official medical term. Instead, it’s a nickname women have coined to describe certain changes in the genital area while using GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro. Though not formally acknowledged by drugmakers, more users are sharing what they notice, and experts are now paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by the NY Post, Dr. Sherry Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, CA, and author of “She-ology” and “She-ology, the She-quel,” told HealthCentral, “[The rapidity of] weight loss can cause visible skin sagging, laxity and wrinkles throughout the body,” adding, “All areas of the body can show visible skin changes in response to this significant weight loss,” she added, “including the lower belly, pubic mons, and inner and outer labia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does it happen and how?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vagina is surrounded by two sets of “lips” or folds of skin. The labia majora are the outer, larger folds, while the labia minora are the inner, smaller folds. They extend from the mons pubis, the rounded, fatty area over the pubic bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some GLP-1 users have complained that their weight loss has led to a decrease in the volume of their labia majora, causing it to appear deflated or aged. Labia puffing may help. The procedure restores volume and fullness to the labia majora via dermal fillers or fat grafting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to a few key factors contributing to Ozempic vulva:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Rapid weight loss:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fast reduction in body fat doesn’t allow skin and soft tissues to adapt, leading to sagging or volume loss in areas like the labia and pubic mound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Muscle loss:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alongside fat loss, muscle mass, including pelvic floor muscles, can decrease. This may reduce support and sensation in the vulvovaginal area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Hormones and hydration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less fat means less stored estrogen, which helps maintain vaginal moisture and tissue health. GI side effects like vomiting or diarrhea can cause dehydration, worsening dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Microbiome disruption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since GLP-1 drugs slow digestion, they can alter gut bacteria. Because gut and vaginal microbes are linked, this may increase the risk of imbalances and infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the NY Post, Dr. Michael Tahery, a board-certified OB/GYN in LA, noted on his website that the fillers used in labia puffing are comparable to facial fillers. The tiny injections can last up to eight months a session and don’t require recovery time. With fat grafts, a doctor injects a small amount of fat from the patient’s thigh, abdomen, or elsewhere in their body into the labia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefit of this treatment is that it does not pose risks for rejection because it uses the patient’s own fat,” Tahery wrote. “The fat is easily reabsorbed by the body over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labiaplasty to reshape the labia and vaginal tightening to restore firmness to the vaginal canal may also provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic Vulva: Common complaints&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens due to the phenomenon of Ozempic vulva? Medical professionals have outlined three key issues associated with this phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sagging or aged appearance of the labia:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rapid fat loss can diminish the padding in the outer labia and pubic area, causing a “deflated,” wrinkled, or aged look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pelvic weakness and vaginal looseness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; GLP-1 medications don’t just reduce fat; they can also lead to muscle loss, including in pelvic muscles. Women may feel reduced tone or looseness, impacting comfort and sexual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dryness and vaginal irritation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dehydration from GI side effects like nausea or diarrhea, along with hormone shifts that reduce natural lubrication, can lead to dryness and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other related symptoms noted include changes in vaginal discharge, odor, and infections, as the gut-vagina microbial balance may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real women, real experiences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by The Sun, 30-year-old Paige Osprey noticed sagging of her labia after losing three stone (≈19 kg) with weight-loss injections like Ozempic. She even mentioned what she called a ‘cameltoe’ effect in tight clothing, a visibility she found distressing. The changes interfered with intimacy and self-esteem. As reported by The Sun, Paige opted for a labia puffing procedure using hyaluronic acid filler, which some call “the other lip filler,” and says it restored volume and confidence, even renewing her sex life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to do if you notice Ozempic vulva?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, consult your healthcare provider if you experience dryness, sagging, or discomfort. Second order of business: hydrate well, especially if you're dealing with gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider supporting your pelvic floor health with exercises and moderating the pace of weight loss to give your body time to adapt. Topical solutions like lubricants, moisturizers, or probiotics can support vaginal health and balance microbiome risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, cosmetic or reconstructive options such as labia puffing (fillers or fat grafts) or labiaplasty are available. However, these should be approached carefully and discussed with a qualified provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. “Ozempic vulva” is an informal term and not a recognized medical diagnosis.

Analysts estimate that the total liability for manufacturer Novo Nordisk could cross 2 billion dollars, making it one of the costliest drug safety disputes in history.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are patients suing Ozempic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ozempic, also sold under brands like Wegovy and Rybelsus, belongs to a group of medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists. These drugs were originally approved to treat type 2 diabetes but soon became popular for weight loss because they suppress appetite, help regulate blood sugar and eventually help in losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden dangers of Ozempic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While many people have lost weight with the drug, more and more patients say it left them with serious side effects. Court filings list a range of serious health problems linked to Ozempic. These include severe gastrointestinal issues such as gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), intestinal blockages, and persistent vomiting. Patients have also reported gallbladder complications like inflammation and gallstones. Some cases involve sudden &lt;a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/life/health/ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-may-cause-rare-but-serious-eye-problems-study-warns/3944997/"&gt;vision loss&lt;/a&gt; linked to a condition called NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy). Apart from these, pancreatitis and kidney damage have also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients say Novo Nordisk did not give them enough warning about these risks, even as more cases of complications were being reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some research studies are being used as evidence in these lawsuits. A 2023 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that people using GLP-1 drugs had a higher risk of developing gastroparesis compared with non-users. Eye specialists have reported a rise in cases of sudden, unexplained vision loss in patients who had recently taken Ozempic. Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration’s adverse events database has logged thousands of complaints about gastrointestinal and vision problems tied to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novo Nordisk calls Ozempic safe &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, Novo Nordisk strongly denies these claims. The company says Ozempic is safe when used as prescribed and that all medications carry some risk. But plaintiffs claim the full scope of potential harm was not communicated, especially when the drug began being widely used for off-label weight loss, a purpose for which it was not originally approved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How did the legal battle start?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first lawsuit was filed in August 2023 by a woman named Jaclyn Bjorklund, who alleged she developed stomach paralysis and vision loss after using Ozempic. By February 2024, so many similar cases had been filed that the U.S. courts consolidated them into a single proceeding, known as multidistrict litigation, in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This step helps streamline cases that involve the same drug and similar injuries. Instead of hundreds of different courts handling the same scientific questions, one judge manages the pretrial process, making it easier to coordinate evidence, expert testimony, and settlement talks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By May 2025, more than 1,800 cases were pending in the MDL. Analysts say hundreds more are likely to be added in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can file a lawsuit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to lawyers handling the cases, people may be able to join the lawsuits if they took Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, or Eli Lilly’s drug Mounjaro and later developed serious health issues such as stomach paralysis, intestinal blockages, gallbladder disease, vision loss, or pancreatitis. They must also have medical records to confirm the diagnosis and file their claim within the legal deadline, which usually ranges from one to three years depending on the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even patients whose symptoms eventually improved may still have a claim, since lawsuits often cover medical costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The litigation is still in the discovery phase as of August 2025. This means both sides are gathering documents, reviewing scientific data, and preparing expert witnesses. The next big steps include:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bellwether trials – A handful of cases will go to trial first. Their outcomes will serve as test runs, showing how juries respond to the evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expert testimony – Doctors and researchers will present studies linking Ozempic to reported side effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Settlement talks – If juries side with patients in early trials, Novo Nordisk may be pushed toward a global settlement covering all pending cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expansion of claims – New side effects such as kidney injury, hair loss, and emotional distress are being reviewed for possible inclusion in lawsuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal experts expect the first bellwether trials in early 2026. The results could set the tone for thousands of future claims.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why could damages reach 2 billion dollars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits are massive in scale, with each case representing a patient who says their health was seriously harmed, sometimes leading to hospital stays, surgeries, or lifelong treatment. If Novo Nordisk is found responsible, the company may have to pay for medical bills (past and future), lost income, and compensation for pain and suffering. Courts could also impose extra penalties if it is proven the company knowingly hid the risks.&lt;br&gt;Analysts say the total could exceed 2 billion dollars. And that figure may grow if more patients join the MDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What patients should know about Ozempic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For anyone using Ozempic or similar drugs, doctors recommend watching closely for symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea or vomiting, sudden changes in vision, or unexplained digestive issues. If any of these occur, patients should seek medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping these medications. While lawsuits are making headlines, many patients still benefit from GLP-1 drugs under careful medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Ozempic lawsuits show the gap between how drugs are approved and how they are later used. Medications designed for diabetes are now prescribed widely for weight loss, sometimes without long-term safety data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This legal fight could change the way drug companies warn about risks, how regulators deal with off-label use, and how much responsibility manufacturers carry when medicines become widely used beyond their original purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>financialexpress.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:10:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxONUdLbkJ2UmNhUWlvZVpET3MzSjI2QlEyZUd1MzZZLWN1YU9OWVdEWDZWTkVuRXpia19EVE5sUGZlbTVvbDRQN3VfeWhPVk01M056b3VnaEtEZklCcHY1OE5GYmxmNTFTcGt0LWIycEhrdnQtZ1ZIZjN2dFA5WjZrZTVrNUstUS0zZC00UFJtTWJmbDBHbG9FRXljWjc1YWQ5RG91N2JFRnZ5aWtJYllyNHZiQzVXX0FncEJNblYwQ19qN1hRRF9sN0lXaG5KSDQ2YnpScWlNaks4cXlIc285Y2VHakxoYUsx</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家揭示女性心脏病发作的微妙症状需要注意-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason why stereotypes are formed. Picture this: you’re watching a commercial that’s either supposed to raise awareness about heart disease or is made to promote a medication to remedy the same. When they show you a heart attack, it’s often the crushing chest pain that’s in focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when we think of a heart attack, we picture sudden and acute chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for many women out there, the signs of a heart attack are far more subtle and hence, easy to miss. Instead of dramatic symptoms, they may experience fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, or even a sense of unease. Because these signs are often mild or vague, they can be easily dismissed as everyday discomforts. And ignoring these hidden warning signals can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dmitry Yaranov, MD (cardiologist), who goes by the username of “heart_transplant_doc” on Instagram, urges the same, saying, “Heart attacks in women often don’t look like heart attacks at all. In my practice, I’ve seen so many women with symptoms they never expected would be related to their hearts—nausea, back or jaw pain, sudden fatigue, shortness of breath.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per him, “These symptoms can be subtle, making it easy to think it’s ‘just stress’ or something minor.” He also adds, “We need to recognize that women’s heart symptoms are often different than men’s. If something feels off, listen to your body. Don’t wait until it’s an emergency—trust your instincts and take action. Early recognition is key, and advocating for better heart health awareness for women can save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what are these subtle symptoms that might be sending SOS signals before the attack actually happens? Understanding these lesser-known signs is vital because early help can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28384657" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Unusual-fatigue-and-weakness" source="Orion"&gt;Unusual fatigue and weakness&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel exhausted lately, more than usual? Do you feel like you’ve drained all your energy just after doing simple daily chores? One of the most common subtle signs among women is extreme tiredness, even after rest. This fatigue often builds up gradually and may persist for days or weeks before other symptoms appear. Simple tasks can feel unusually exhausting, hinting that something more serious might be underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women may feel breathless even when not active, or lightheaded and dizzy without warning. No, it’s not always the exhaustion from physical labor, or even a mere fluctuation in the blood pressure level. These symptoms can mislead one to think of stress, low blood pressure, or respiratory issues. Yet they can be a sign of insufficient oxygen getting to the heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jaw, neck, back, shoulder, or arm discomfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain may radiate to areas far from the chest, such as the jaw, neck, upper back, shoulders, or arms. Ana again, they might not be the consequence of just spending yourself too much, and dealing with a lot of stress, despite often being perceived that way. These sensations may feel like muscle strain, tightness, or pressure, rather than sharp pain, making it easy to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digestive symptoms: Nausea, indigestion, or stomach pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel a strange, unexplained discomfort inside your stomach? It might not be the food or any regular bowel movement issues. Symptoms like nausea, vomiting, indigestion, or upper abdominal pain are common in women experiencing heart attacks. These can be misread as heartburn, flu, or food poisoning, causing delays in seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cold sweats, clammy skin, or anxiety&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most of us brush them away thinking that symptoms like anxiety and cold sweats are issues related to stress and mental health, in reality, they can be as much as subtle signs of an onset of a heart attack. Apart from being the obvious symptoms, these are quiet but common signs that often come along with, or instead of, other more prominent and recognizable symptoms of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep disturbances&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disturbed sleep, trouble falling asleep, waking frequently, or still feeling exhausted after a full night's rest aren’t always screaming insomnia, a sleep disorder, or simply a consequence of stress; they can signal something deeper at play. Research reveals that many women notice these changes days or weeks before a heart event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Silent or ‘invisible’ heart attacks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, some heart attacks show up with almost no symptoms. Known as ‘silent’ heart attacks, these events can go undetected, even by the person experiencing them. Women may attribute mild discomfort or indigestive feelings to stress or fatigue, only to later discover heart damage via medical tests like ECG or MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why women’s symptoms are often misunderstood&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, yet awareness of warning signs is significantly lower. Conforming to the stereotypes, severe chest pain is still viewed as the only signal of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biological and hormonal differences in women also shape how symptoms appear. Conditions like coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) or artery spasms can cause unusual chest discomfort but go undetected in standard tests. Women may experience heart attacks without large arterial blockages due to microvascular dysfunction or artery spasms (MINOCA). Another example: spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but serious cause, particularly in younger women, postpartum, or those healthy otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a well-documented gender bias in heart disease care, sometimes called the ‘Yentl syndrome’, where women’s symptoms are under-recognized or misclassified, delaying diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do: Prevention, awareness, and action&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Learn and share the subtle signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that symptoms in women often go beyond chest pain, such as fatigue, breathlessness, discomfort in odd places, stomach issues, sweating, dizziness, or sleep problems, which can all be warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Early action matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick response saves lives. Delays can lead to serious heart damage or fatal outcomes. Call emergency services immediately if you suspect a heart attack, even without chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Know your risk factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, family history, and hormonal factors (like menopause or pregnancy-related conditions) elevate heart attack risk in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Advocate for yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If symptoms come on suddenly or feel wrong, insist on a timely medical evaluation. Be clear with healthcare staff, it might not be anxiety or indigestion, but a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintain good heart health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay active, eat a heart-healthy diet, manage stress, avoid smoking, and schedule regular check-ups for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, especially important for post-menopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Common signs of a heart attack in women!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 01:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>使用Mounjaro后停止堆积英镑的简单解决方案-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxOUlBPTnV3SEh2YlBFbjhFaGJRMzVQZUNYbzl1c0llOFZ5bHpTU214dkFiSVJPUzJyMmFZeVFFYTk3bU5OcEJ2V2hvVFpIMnNQc3ByMnVpb0JwbFhsQXpqYUtKdy0ySlo2Sk93b2lJYmVkcmk5dVZjc3JXSG4wSVAwLVJkTXl2MC1hZnlReWFxTlozaUI0N0pIc0hzbklfNDVDemZSbnRNX0dqejdyVFRRQmliVFQtVEREdkNtYWJsYldxSmY4YWJQSEdkS3Y0S3RXZTB6blFBQmZkdGV1cFpNTVB1cEEtOG1vNEJVU19R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss wonder jabs such as Mounjaro and Wegovy are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12020271/Lillys-Mounjaro-leads-16-weight-loss-obese-diabetics-trial.html"&gt;helping to transform the lives and health of millions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one in five users stop taking these drugs within a year, due to intolerable side-effects ranging from nausea and vomiting to gallstones and pancreatitis – a serious infection of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority then pile weight back on, as studies show at least 90 per cent of those who quit the jabs regain what they lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But could a stick-on pad, that looks like a giant Band-Aid and is placed on the stomach for just a few hours, reduce the drop-out rate – by enabling people on the drugs to ensure they’re taking the correct dose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Gastric Alimetry pad is stuck on to a patient’s stomach to determine the precise rate at which it empties when they’re taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fat-busting jabs work in two ways – they mimic the effects of a hormone called GLP-1, which tells the brain that the stomach is full. And they also slow down the rate at which the stomach empties, making us feel fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too high a dose of the drugs can slow the emptying process too far, leading to nausea, vomiting and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One in five users of weight-loss wonder jabs such as Mounjaro and Wegovy stop taking them within a year, due to intolerable side-effects ranging from nausea and vomiting to gallstones and pancreatitis – a serious infection of the pancreas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, it can cause gastroparesis – or stomach paralysis – where the stomach muscles are weakened and food is not digested properly. The worst-case scenario here is that surgery is needed to insert a feeding tube to temporarily bypass the stomach, or to remove a mass of undigested food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, too low a dose can mean the stomach empties too quickly for the drug to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss jabs are usually started at a dose of 0.25mg once a week, rising gradually to 2.4mg after around four months. But effects vary – and working out the correct dose can be informed guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, there have been reports of websites selling pens (for self-injecting) containing either the wrong dose or no active ingredient at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s hoped the device, developed in New Zealand, could help doctors work out precisely what dose each patient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Packed with dozens of tiny electrodes, the high-tech pad carries out something called an electrogastrogram – which measures the stomach’s electrical activity (from stomach contractions) – in much the same way as an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracks the heart’s electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This enables medics to map a clearer picture of how the stomach is functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal rate for a healthy stomach to empty is two to four hours – but studies suggest that this can be much slower in patients taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Could a stick-on pad, that looks like a giant Band-Aid and is placed on the stomach for just a few hours, reduce the weight-loss jab drop-out rate – by enabling people on the drugs to ensure they’re taking the correct dose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After four hours, most patients’ stomachs are still 30 per cent full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Gastric Alimetry pad is connected to a small electronic box or reader, which is paired with an app on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients fast for at least six hours beforehand to ensure an empty stomach, then consume a cereal bar. The device monitors electrical activity over four hours as the food passes through the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The device, designed as a non-invasive alternative to endoscopes (where a camera is passed down the throat attached to a tiny tube), is already being used in some private clinics to assess patients with conditions such as acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A trial is also under way at University College London involving NHS patients with chronic stomach symptoms who have not been helped by previous treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study by scientists from the University of Auckland in New Zealand backs the idea it could be used to help people on GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, whose work was published in the journal Gastroenterology in May, used the pad to measure stomach function in 20 healthy volunteers who’d been given different doses of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 15 per cent of cases it detected that the drugs had trigged gastric dysrhythmia - when the stomach’s pulses become chaotic - causing a range of symptoms including nausea, early fullness and sometimes vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rehan Haidry, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic in London, says that the Gastric Alimetry pad gives doctors the ability to measure actual stomach function reliably – something an endoscopy, which offers a visual examination of the food pipe for instance, cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Good Health: ‘This device will find the ideal point at which the stomach is slowly emptying but not so slow that it causes the side-effects.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Anthony Hobson, a gastrointestinal clinical scientist at the private Functional Gut Clinic in London, agrees: ‘Rather than people giving up on these jabs, this technology could find the “sweet spot” so they would still have the weight loss but not &lt;a target="_self" href="/debate/article-14280009/FERGUS-WALSH-fat-jabs-transform-lives-obese-experts-bankrupt-NHS.html"&gt;endure some unpleasant side-effects&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is, however, not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For patients who want to undergo the test privately, it costs £1,875 and Professor Hobson admits that ‘only the patients with the highest medical needs and worst side-effects might choose this approach’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And new ways to avoid side-effects when taking weight-loss jabs are being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in the Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2022 found eating foods such as crackers, apples or mint might help those suffering with nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, research published in the journal Obesity Pillars in May this year also found that acupressure wristbands, normally worn to ease travel and morning sickness, could alleviate nausea symptoms in people taking GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a group of 31 people who were taking the weight-loss jabs and suffering from nausea, it led to an 80 per cent reduction in the severity of their nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s thought pressure on certain nerve pathways in the wrist calms the nervous system and regulates stomach muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:51:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxOUlBPTnV3SEh2YlBFbjhFaGJRMzVQZUNYbzl1c0llOFZ5bHpTU214dkFiSVJPUzJyMmFZeVFFYTk3bU5OcEJ2V2hvVFpIMnNQc3ByMnVpb0JwbFhsQXpqYUtKdy0ySlo2Sk93b2lJYmVkcmk5dVZjc3JXSG4wSVAwLVJkTXl2MC1hZnlReWFxTlozaUI0N0pIc0hzbklfNDVDemZSbnRNX0dqejdyVFRRQmliVFQtVEREdkNtYWJsYldxSmY4YWJQSEdkS3Y0S3RXZTB6blFBQmZkdGV1cFpNTVB1cEEtOG1vNEJVU19R</guid></item><item><title>新泽西州卫生官员调查莫里斯县可能的疟疾病例- ABC7纽约</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQT29RREJpLU9BZkQ2S1hFdktnbDZTbVNhRDE3eHJUVEx2LV9TVjFxWnNVN0tXTlJxRFZjT3hvTGRYTjVWOTJZa1hJUWNZamxtaURVVEphVmJwaVpqZWs2NDJDazZFWV9iaERpMWo3dHA0bE50SVBmTUxZZkxqTUJ5WDZCWUJaSjlGekFhSjZIMXF1QVh2VV96RjdTb3lqem1ZdC130gGoAUFVX3lxTFBRbEZpOGQzWHAtVVVTcGFYRE93RHZBU08waTNDVjNzZm9lNmN5ZnUwNnJBUG15cUJROFZaSE1BbDRrVm4yRWdndTRqVUkzNFBQQXAzdHdkVmJwT29BeFZueENSSXBwektrZEFCbnB5TU1tTG53ZmtWS2JURnpjTUgzRHdMX2luQXg3ZEFxVl9Yd2RtdHRVdnBma1dET2Nxel9ONHB4TkU4Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;MORRIS COUNTY  (WABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;New Jersey health officials are investigating a case of malaria in Morris County with no international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The New Jersey Department of Health is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate potential sources of infection.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;With the school year underway in La Plata County, hallways are filling with students – and the germs that come with them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;To combat disease, several key vaccinations are required for K-12 students attending public schools in Colorado – unless an exemption is granted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Public schools in Colorado – including Durango, Bayfield and Ignacio school districts – must follow &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/exemptions-to-school-required-vaccines" id="link-8293f90e60650622dbad5d395e35f790" target="_blank"&gt;state law&lt;/a&gt; on immunizations and &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/exemptions-to-school-required-vaccines" id="link-f38b09464251a6a5ee97f0e404118bb3" target="_blank"&gt;exemptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Required &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/immunization/school-required-vaccines" id="link-d87352c7e8d0b7b1ca71549f0f024ada" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; for K-12 students, unless an approved exemption is filed, include diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP); hepatitis B; measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); polio; and varicella (chickenpox).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We believe getting vaccinated is an important part of school readiness,” said Karla Sluis, spokeswoman for Durango School District. “It keeps children from catching and spreading diseases that can make them sick and potentially disrupt learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A Durango School District email sent out this summer said all students attending its schools or child care facilities must have a complete immunization record or an approved exemption submitted to their school. Without that, the student may not attend school.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Medical exemptions, which apply to students who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, must be signed by a licensed health care provider. This exemption only needs to be submitted once.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Nonmedical exemptions – for personal or religious reasons – must be submitted annually at the beginning of every school year. Such exemptions require either a signature from an immunizing provider or proof of completion of an educational module from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Jessica Resner, a pediatric nurse practitioner at 4 Corners Children’s Clinic, said parent preference – not medical necessity – is the most common reason she sees for K-12 vaccine opt-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;But when it comes to medical exemptions, allergies to vaccine components are the most common reason students are exempted at the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html" id="link-3592a3ee3ff12176df466485fc91f216" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, other medical exemptions may include a weakened immune system or a history of seizures – among others.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We recommend following the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/Immunization-Schedules" id="link-980921dfd85a4bda84c5f89f82c9d2f9" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; routine vaccine schedule,” Resner said. “It’s important to reduce disease burden in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Resner said vaccination rates at 4 Corners Children’s Clinic remain steady compared to the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In the 2021-22 school year, Southwest Colorado had fairly high vaccine compliance, &lt;a href="https://www.immunizecolorado.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/House-District-3_Fact-Sheet_2021-22.pdf" id="link-e8af3b0d60cf5660a6138f427a43219e" target="_blank"&gt;according to Immunize Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. The MMR and pertussis vaccine rates hovered at 95%, with polio and varicella vaccinations at 94%.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A 95% vaccination rate is considered the threshold for herd immunity in a given community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Durango School District has seen MMR vaccine rates improve since the 2019-20 school year, when rates ranged from 76% to 88% – a low for the district. By comparison, the MMR vaccination rate in 2023-24 was 94%, according to &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/immunization/school-and-child-care-data" id="link-fc5d37297d621e330fc5ccfbee51afe6" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Vaccination data for the 2025-26 school year is not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We respect parental choice when it comes to their child’s health, and we prefer not to speculate on what families may be thinking about recent political shifts and decisions,” Sluis said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Sluis was referring to views some may hold about Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/health/kennedy-vaccines-confidence-access.html" id="link-f7e04db72024d32b2c2d3de5b5811e4d" target="_blank"&gt;stance on vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Our primary concern is student health and minimizing disruptions to learning,” Sluis said. “We strive to keep health-related communications factual, respectful and grounded in state requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A rare genetic mutation appears to make people basically invulnerable to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; – and it could potentially be harnessed as a therapy. Researchers have now shown this surprising viral protection can be replicated in mice and hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have yet to find a &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt; that can break through the therapy's defenses [in cell culture tests]," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Columbia University immunologist Dusan Bogunovic, who first discovered this unusual antiviral superpower &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1224026"&gt;13 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation, a deficiency in interferon-stimulated gene 15 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISG15"&gt;ISG15&lt;/a&gt;), causes a mild yet persistent inflammation across the body. Examining patients' immune cells revealed they'd had the usual run of encounters with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, measles, chickenpox, and mumps, yet they'd never reported feeling particularly ill as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-infectious-disease-could-be-the-biggest-problem-in-2025-an-expert-explains"&gt;Which Infectious Disease Could Be The Biggest Problem in 2025? An Expert Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed their body's &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;-fighting proteins were constantly on a low level alert, never really put away for later like in most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Bogunovic and colleagues have used technology similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-who-made-covid-vaccine-possible-awarded-nobel-prize"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to provide a temporary ISG15 deficiency in lab animals. The therapy provides instructions that help target cells build 10 proteins that the team identified as primarily responsible for the antiviral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171750" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1.jpg" alt="Rare Mutation Seems to Make People Impervious to Viruses" class="wp-image-171750 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1-535x415.jpg 535w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171750" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The technology uses our body's natural ability to build proteins from mRNA instructions. (Ali Damouh/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the bodies of test mice and hamsters successfully created more of these proteins, which attack the viruses at multiple stages of their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then challenged the vaccinated animals with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;. The protective proteins restricted the infection, but did not appear to interfere with the rest of the animals' immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We only generate a small amount of these 10 proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic. "But that inflammation is enough to prevent [viral] diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of inoculation were temporary, lasting up to four days. That might not sound like long enough to be very useful as a vaccine platform, but it could be administered as short-term protection for healthcare workers, even before vaccines targeting specific viruses have been developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the technology will work even if we don't know the identity of the &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique has the potential to massively boost our responses during future pandemics that may be similar to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spanish-flu"&gt;Spanish Flu&lt;/a&gt;, which have killed millions of people at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is still in the extremely early stages of testing. There are many challenges to resolve around how to safely deliver the mRNA to where it's needed in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;qualifies&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://time.com/7309755/cutting-mrna-research-deadly-mistake/"&gt;political and social pushback&lt;/a&gt; against mRNA technology may also prove to be a large hurdle. But given the potential of the new method, it may be well worth the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adx5758"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They may have had a common exposure with another Mesa County case reported last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin Minnerath, deputy director of Mesa County Public Health, said the signs and symptoms of measles start with respiratory issues. “That would be a cough, runny nose, and red eyes. The person can develop a high fever. And then after that, they would develop a rash.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash starts at the hairline and moves down the face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible exposure locations in and around Grand Junction include a clinic, a church and a couple of restaurants. They can be found on the state &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/diseases-a-to-z/measles/colorado-exposure-location-information"&gt;health department’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said Saturday that they are investigating whether the cases are instances of community transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are also alerting the public about a possible measles exposure at Denver International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passenger with measles traveled through DIA's C concourse last Tuesday, Aug. 12. The state health department and its counterparts in Denver and the airport said an out-of-state traveler with a confirmed case of measles arrived at gate C51. That person boarded another flight at gate C50 the same day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was in that location may have been exposed. If you were there, watch for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. If symptoms develop, call your health care provider, urgent care, or emergency department before going in, and tell them you may have been exposed to measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This incident serves as a reminder that travel in crowded public spaces, such as airports, increases the risk of exposure to various communicable diseases. It is important for everyone to stay up to date on their vaccinations, especially before traveling, to protect themselves and others,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Deputy Chief Medical Officer and State Epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of Colorado’s 21 cases, more than one has been reported in Arapahoe, Adams, Denver, El Paso and Mesa counties. Two-thirds were unvaccinated people or those whose status was unknown. Four cases have been in kids younger than 4, the rest have been in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state reports five people have been hospitalized; no one has died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the five hospitalized cases, four were unvaccinated, according to a state health department spokesperson. One had an unknown vaccine status, where there is no reliable documented evidence of a person's vaccination history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two were children and three were adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2025, Colorado &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/dcphr/measles-information"&gt;barely recorded&lt;/a&gt; any measles cases for the last decade, often recording one, two or zero cases for an entire year. That’s changed this year, with hundreds of cases popping up around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. this year, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,356 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; were reported by 41 states, as of Aug. 5, 2025, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been 32 outbreaks reported in 2025, and 87 percent of confirmed cases (1,177 of 1,356) are outbreak-associated. In more than 170 cases, the person has been hospitalized, 13 percent.

In dry weather, the spores spread as dry dust and soil are kicked up because of construction, agriculture or wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think climate change is the main reason to explain this type of dramatic explosion,” Yang told SFGATE. “I don’t think anything else can explain this type of phenomenon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang said his lab used to see about one case of Valley fever a month, but now it often sees five cases per month, including an occasional pediatric case of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When children get this kind of very severe [Valley fever,] it’s very devastating,” Yang said, explaining that infection can disseminate and spread to the bone in children, requiring chronic treatments. “They’re not going to live normally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Galgiani, the director for the University of Arizona Valley Fever Center for Excellence, said one explanation for the increase in cases is that health officials have streamlined some of the reporting process. Galgiani pointed out that patients who tested positive for Valley fever used to have to be tracked down to confirm their symptoms before their cases were reported to the state, and in recent years, that requirement has been loosened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The actual impact of the disease is probably not as great a change as the numbers appear,” Galgiani told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said while cases have increased, they are still variable, and occasionally, the number of annual cases has sometimes dipped below previous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that it looks higher now doesn’t mean it’s going to be even higher next year, and then higher after that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani did echo Yang’s concern that changes in climate could push the fungus into new areas of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s estimates that climate change, or the long-term effect of climate change will increase the distribution of the infection across the western United States, all the way to the Canadian border,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can cause severe fatigue, cough, fever, night sweats and muscle pain, and it can last weeks to months. In severe cases, the spores can &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverSymptoms.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;disseminate&lt;/a&gt; in the body, infecting the bones, brain or skin. In these cases, a person may need to be on anti-fungal medications for the rest of their lives, according to Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can also be deadly, with 1 out of 10 people hospitalized for the disease dying from it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverBasics.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people will have severe symptoms, Yang said a majority of people will either not get sick or have mild symptoms if they come into contact with the spores. Since so many people do not get diagnosed, the actual number of cases is likely about 10 to 18 times higher than what is reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverGroupsAtRisk.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;most at risk for developing Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; are those who live or work in agriculture or construction in areas where it’s endemic. People over 60, pregnant people, people who have diabetes and those with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of having serious or debilitating symptoms if they get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said if you think you could be at risk and start to get symptoms, you should get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-4" data-large-id="Inline-6" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is, if you have pneumonia in Bakersfield, for example, or other endemic places, or if you visited there, you should be tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNVW5ycy0wRS1GX0x2ZlRFTXJWSXZsTFZUamdYWlAtMUUzTlJEMDMzRFlPaHI3TmNBOWpMV3dXQnl4bHh5QVpOVnkyX0ZNdFRFMnExbUVBbFV1X3I2YUNkaWN3VVVtUnlTV2pPZU5KRmFwdTByNkR5SV9wa1JCZURLeHhuaVF0V3ZScE4xOVphNzJnTnc3</guid></item><item><title>专家说， “僵尸兔”病毒已经存在了一段时间，有助于HPV研究- KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOb1JDeDlQbXVWd2NRNS1Zb0l6V09uQ3ktUzF5NHlhMXB3MTIzV3BrWmg4ZHdtcXZXWWY4RUQzWG9vVXZXT2UxZ1R0bGNUMFh5bmtoSHlqT1pCUUR5ZXNLRVVQRm1zMlpZaUc1LVJxRGtxVnByMDhQdGJMblMxQ1Q5TE5mbExBTGtxQXNVOVlFUWNnb2ZQZmtHd3pYcWF0cFhwWTV0YWJJUkZRdUZPS25Jd2xRUzA3a1lKanF1bE5LakxhWU5Cb2lobF9B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a thumb rule to never disturb your pooch while they are watching their favorite show. And if you do, be ready to face their wrath just like this pet parent. His pooch not only threw a tantrum but also gave an earful to his owner for disturbing him on purpose. The funny bickering video between the parent and the Husky for the TV show caught everyone’s attention online, garnering more than 54K likes at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Husky is clearly upset with owner for turning off favorite TV show in funny video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital creator Corey Moriarty was peacefully watching a TV show with his beloved &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/siberian-husky" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Husky;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Husky&lt;/a&gt;, Blue, when he thought to prank his pooch. What did he do? He switched off his fur baby’s favorite cartoon, “Bluey,” mid-episode. What followed next was an episode of tantrums and a blame game that the pet parent captured in a video and uploaded on @imbluethesiberian to show his Husky’s reaction after turning off his TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reel shows Blue rolling on the bed in a fit of rage after “Spare” turned off his cartoon. However, the owner played innocent all along, saying he did not turn off the TV as he was on his “phone the whole time.” The pet parent blamed the timing ban on Disney. He said that the entertainment giant has issued a new guideline stating that “no kids can watch after 10.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the smart pooch knew his human was lying through his teeth. He constantly insisted his human companion “do something” and turn the show on. But the owner remained firm on his stance, saying that he couldn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue even asked the owner to call Disney to fix the issue. But the paw parent refused since he didn’t have their “number.” After a while of back and forth, the visibly upset canine ended up sneaking under the bed, expressing his disappointment with his human companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at his Husky’s reaction, the pet parent commented on the post, “Someone better call Disney before Blue sends a letter…” The hilarious video left netizens in awe of the Husky. One person said, “That head turn and side eye someone is in for it! Watch out Spare.” Many others supported Blue’s tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/186774-video-husky-throws-tantrum-after-owner-turns-off-favorite-tv-show" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Husky Throws Tantrum After Owner Turns off Favorite TV Show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: Husky Throws Tantrum After Owner Turns off Favorite TV Show&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE45U1ZpbS1TMTl3YXFCV2JNc0ttT0hNbEk5d0RzU0hhUmFSd0dIQ3JVdjdZXzE4SnJNR2tDSlc2MnZXdU50NEdBTkIwX0xURnd5YTZyNEU4SFVrX3NBakdlRTV2LTFkT0tIalIzQTBFbmVvSXNxRnc</guid></item><item><title>吃半杯3 $的零食可以预防癌症-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVjFGYWo4VXpBSUZoTVlaakpLeDJTYXJQSzAwNkxCNFZOcmtHeVZSYnBQN1M1S3JJdTI5NjhnUTdwMGdWdVVZOFBrT3RSMTdXaDZNSnhEX2phdHRoUEdHcUJGTHFyMzZiVHRhYURQZ0Z4LXZSNzFhak5ta1dLbFQwQ2dwRUdWZ0Zmc2xFQ1dkNGFlMVQ3TXNOTENfcTNXekp4cHZfNkJR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBWVnJKZG8tb3BZekdVT3c0YzBEYkdmVGVWV1EzLUFHTkRaWXI2ZFdXYWlDWlBnSUQ3blBTeUJQTWpVUzhfb0daRlk5VW5uTEc1ZTIxMTdGVlZ4dDNRdll2UUxpMUpiREFWdHlndXdLaW5KVWxnc05WbVh6cGhTVXYyLUphNEpjUHRXc1hodEdQUE5VY1pjQVM3YV9PcEtMTG9uanc4VE4wQUUwbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating just two handfuls of almonds has been shown to help protect the body from stress and aging-induced damage that can fuel cancer-causing cell mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cells are under constant attack from a barrage of stressors, including pollution, UV radiation, processed foods and the body’s regular metabolism, all of which generate harmful free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes over time, contributing to aging &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-5445877/Bowel-cancer-patients-eat-nuts-suggest-study.html"&gt;and many types of cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, repeated attacks overwhelm the cell’s ability to repair itself. If this damage affects genes that control growth and death, mutations accumulate, allowing abnormal cells to multiply unchecked, eventually forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutrition scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iran/index.html" id="mol-b94af090-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/afghanistan/index.html" id="mol-b94a0630-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; reported that consuming almonds, around two large handfuls, significantly improved oxidative stress markers by reducing DNA and lipid damage while boosting antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits were strongest with higher almond intake, likely due to their vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results varied between studies, though, possibly due to differences in the ways almonds were prepared, such as salting or roasting, or the study subjects’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds are widely recognized &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13334127/Eat-nuts-seeds-fight-disease-Healthy-snacks-added-5-day-guidance-boost-nations-health-report-suggests.html"&gt;as a nutritious food&lt;/a&gt;, but quantifying their specific health benefits has proven difficult due to inconsistent research findings stemming from key variables across studies, including differences in almond preparation methods (such as roasting versus raw), study durations, and characteristics of the people in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research consolidates previous studies and fragmented findings to better identify how and how much almonds benefit the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating roughly 60g almonds daily (about 2 handfuls) reduced oxidative damage, lowering DNA harm and lipid damage (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing all the research, scientists focused on eight high-quality studies involving 424 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The studies tested different groups, including healthy adults, smokers, and people with chronic diseases, using almond doses ranging from a small handful, about five grams, to about six handfuls, or roughly 168g, per day for one to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds' health benefits depend on the serving size. Eating at least two large handfuls daily, about 60g, made a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating this amount reduced cell membrane damage by a statistically significant 0.46 units, lowered DNA damage by 5.83 units, and boosted the body's natural defenses by 2.02 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have been trying to prove almonds’ anti-cancer impacts for years, since the 1997 report of the World Cancer Research Fund, which concluded that, while there are ‘theoretical reasons to believe that diets high in nuts and seeds might protect against some cancers, the evidence is currently lacking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over two decades of research has revealed important connections between nut consumption &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jsfa.2659?casa_token=4R4dHrw8ehEAAAAA%3A30JFIBoxJen8wtjhJCChlNOz_JLhuBadWr9Llhclpp3aaa4_DXQs243otC9hP88qobJ0-1jlZECcE_M"&gt;and cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;, with almonds emerging as a particularly promising food in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Large observational studies spanning multiple countries have found that people who regularly eat nuts tend to have lower rates of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evidence also suggests a potential protective effect against colon cancer in women, with those consuming just a small handful of nuts daily, about six grams, showing measurable benefits compared to those who did not eat almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The figure, published in Advances in Nutrition, shows how eating different amounts of nuts affects a person's risk of serious health problems. The solid red line shows whether more nuts lower risk (when the line goes down) or do not make much difference (when it is flat). The blue shaded area shows the confidence interval. When it is narrow, researchers are more certain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Population-level findings are supported by laboratory research showing that almonds may actively combat cancer development at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal studies have shown that eating an almond-rich diet can reduce the formation of precancerous growths in the digestive tract and may trigger natural anti-tumor defenses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds pack a powerful nutritional punch, making them a favorite snack among dietitians and nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323000686#:~:text=An%20intake%20of%2028%20g,and%20diabetes%20incidence%20were%20mixed."&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; showed that eating 28 grams of nuts daily, such as almonds, walnuts, cashews, and pistachios, was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and atrial fibrillation, an 11 percent reduced risk of dying from cancer, and a 22 percent lower risk of premature death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits likely come from their unique combination of healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants that improve cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of being rich in vitamins that protect cells from oxidative damage, such as vitamin E, almonds contain monounsaturated fats that lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent, an effect comparable to a diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These findings support almonds as a functional food for oxidation management,’ the researchers said, adding that more rigorously controlled studies are required before implementing broad dietary guidelines to include more almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not examine toxicity, but overeating almonds can have drawbacks. Two heaping handfuls of almonds contain around seven grams of fiber, around 27 percent of the daily recommended amount. Too much too fast could cause bloating, gas or diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, overeating almonds can cause vitamin E toxicity if the person is also taking a vitamin E supplement or a multivitamin containing vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin E acts as a blood thinner. Very high doses may increase bruising or bleeding risk, especially if a person is taking blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are susceptible to kidney stones should also moderate their almond consumption. Almonds contain oxalates. The body converts excess oxalates into crystals that may form stones, especially when combined with low fluid intake or other risk factors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, a person would have to eat magnitudes more almonds than what is typical.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 400mg vitamin E supplement plus 60g almonds, 15mg, is safe, reaching the 1,000mg upper limit would require eating 5.3 lbs (2.4kg) of almonds daily alongside the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, research shows the oxalate content in typical almond portions poses little risk when consumed as part of a balanced diet with adequate hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVjFGYWo4VXpBSUZoTVlaakpLeDJTYXJQSzAwNkxCNFZOcmtHeVZSYnBQN1M1S3JJdTI5NjhnUTdwMGdWdVVZOFBrT3RSMTdXaDZNSnhEX2phdHRoUEdHcUJGTHFyMzZiVHRhYURQZ0Z4LXZSNzFhak5ta1dLbFQwQ2dwRUdWZ0Zmc2xFQ1dkNGFlMVQ3TXNOTENfcTNXekp4cHZfNkJR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBWVnJKZG8tb3BZekdVT3c0YzBEYkdmVGVWV1EzLUFHTkRaWXI2ZFdXYWlDWlBnSUQ3blBTeUJQTWpVUzhfb0daRlk5VW5uTEc1ZTIxMTdGVlZ4dDNRdll2UUxpMUpiREFWdHlndXdLaW5KVWxnc05WbVh6cGhTVXYyLUphNEpjUHRXc1hodEdQUE5VY1pjQVM3YV9PcEtMTG9uanc4VE4wQUUwbw</guid></item><item><title>州政府表示，新泽西州居民感染疟疾可能是几十年来首例“本土”病例- NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxONmhCVXRKbS1pR2lRTG8tSk90OE04dkRkMFljN1FSMWJSLTBuUGhxajBzMGJlQVUxcDhmV3pWY1JPNWZaU1N2TVZlNHNJSHZDcEpFWmE2LWxGazFWSVlPQzJaaTVMQUFWNVQtazRBNmpOd0hyRGVLeU0tUi1hZ2s5bl9QWGtHOFQ3eXhHTUtBMDNQclExdXllQWZSUk94WF91LXpSVGV6cnJyVlBHY2Uzc3luX1FFakRXVlNHLS04TdIB0wFBVV95cUxNanNTRUZOTFgyNlRkdE1vVk0wbnRwcl9sdVJrWmtTRTh2OVpzdFNvNkVOb0Y2QXRZenI3d0hZY0FoaHVZZUtqMW5QQWM2aUtDOXhuakhZS2ljTy03Q2o5YmZfQUt2QkVISWhYQnRxbEo2WC0xNTF5dk1FeENraGQ4bERYcVBSNFhLOWZ0Q2dwSVFZY1cxLWROdjFmYzBuWl9qdnlMczNQYXlYQV9Oc3lDTVI1SDAtZVFxMHFfVkt2Y1h6RzItR0VsZC1hT0oxV0dpeEhZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QSHR6ZSSZFCT5GJCF4MC2KTYFA"&gt;Investigators are trying to determine whether a Morris County resident infected with malaria represents the first locally-acquired case of the disease in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2A6GIR2SI5HDPBYGQ3UILM6JH4"&gt;The resident, who has no international travel history, was not identified.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproductive timing matters when it comes to aging and age-related disease. In a study now online at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, Buck Institute for Research on Aging researchers have &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102447" target="_blank"&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that girls who go through puberty (the onset of menstruation) before the age of 11 or women who give birth before the age of 21 have double the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart failure and obesity and quadruple the risk of developing severe metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study also reveals that later puberty and childbirth are genetically associated with longer lifespan, lower frailty, slower epigenetic aging and reduced risk of age-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buck professor Pankaj Kapahi, Ph.D., senior author of the study, says the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/public+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; implications of the research are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even though women are routinely asked about their menstrual and childbirth history when they receive medical care, this information has rarely factored into the care they receive outside of OB/GYN," he says. "These &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, whether positive or negative, clearly have significant influence on a variety of age-related diseases and should be considered in the larger context of overall health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was based on one of the most comprehensive analyses to date, using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/regression+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;regression analysis&lt;/a&gt; on nearly 200,000 women in the UK Biobank to confirm &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+associations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic associations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We identified 126 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+markers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; that mediate the effects of early puberty and childbirth on aging," said postdoctoral fellow Yifan Xiang, MD, who led the research. "Many of these markers are involved in well-known longevity pathways, such as IGF-1, growth hormone, AMPK and mTOR signaling, key regulators of metabolism and aging."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Genetic associations for antagonistic pleiotropy in humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution is based on natural selection, acting on traits early in life to encourage reproduction and survival of the species. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggests that traits beneficial in the young can have negative effects later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides some of the strongest human evidence for this theory," Kapahi says. "We show that genetic factors favoring early reproduction come with a significant cost later in life, including accelerated aging and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;. It makes sense that the very factors that help enhance the survival of the offspring may lead to detrimental consequences for the mother."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The role of BMI in aging and disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says the study highlights the role of Body Mass Index (BMI) as a critical mediator of this process, finding that early reproductive events contribute to a higher BMI, which in turn increases the risk of metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One can envision that enhancing the ability to absorb nutrients would benefit the offspring, but if nutrients are plentiful, then it can enhance the risk of obesity and diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for public health and basic science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says understanding the long-term impact of reproductive timing allows for the development of personalized health care strategies that could help mitigate the risks associated with early puberty and early childbirth, adding that lifestyle modifications, metabolic screenings and tailored dietary recommendations could improve long-term health in women.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;He says taking reproductive timing into account is currently relevant, based on research that shows the age at which girls in the US begin menstruating has dropped by about three months per decade since the 1970s. No specific causes for the phenomena have been identified, but research suggests obesity may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While updated research guidelines call for the use of both sexes in preclinical research in mice, Kapahi says this current study still challenges traditional experimental design, noting that most disease models use virgin female mice, which may not accurately represent real-world aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If evolution has shaped us to prioritize early reproduction at the cost of aging, how can we leverage this knowledge to extend health span in modern society?" Kapahi asks. "While we cannot change our genetic inheritance, understanding these genetic tradeoffs empowers us to make informed choices about health, lifestyle and medical care."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also identifies several genetic pathways that can be manipulated to optimize the health of mothers as well as their offspring, Kapahi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Buck researchers involved in the study include: Vineeta Tanwar, Parminder Singh, and Lizellen La Follette,&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s supposed pregnancy turned out to be something much stranger. In a recent report from her doctors, they detail how the woman had developed an incredibly rare form of ovarian cancer that mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy, even causing a positive pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in India &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/article/622/text/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case of mistaken identity earlier this July in the journal Oncoscience. After first suspecting the woman had an ectopic pregnancy, the doctors instead discovered a large and rare type of tumor in her right ovary. Thankfully, the cancer was removed before it spread elsewhere, and the woman seems to have responded well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A pregnancy that wasn’t&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the 36-year-old woman visited doctors three months into having intermittent bouts of heavy menstrual bleeding. She tested positive for a pregnancy on a urine test, and when doctors performed a physical examination, they felt a solid mass along her abdomen consistent with having a 20-week-old fetus. An initial ultrasound appeared to show that the woman was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, a condition where the embryo forms outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancies are inherently non-viable). After conducting more extensive imaging, they found that she actually had cancer in her right ovary, most likely a choriocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24863-choriocarcinoma"&gt;Choriocarcinomas&lt;/a&gt; are tumors mainly formed from the cells that become the placenta during a pregnancy. It’s an especially dangerous cancer since the tumors tend to grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. The woman’s doctors soon performed surgery to assess the progression of her cancer and to treat it if possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They successfully removed the tumor, along with the woman’s uterus, ovaries, and surrounding lymph nodes. Though relatively large, the tumor was still in an early stage of development and hadn’t metastasized. When the doctors looked closer, though, they found her cancer was even weirder than first thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Exceedingly rare’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choriocarcinomas are usually gestational, meaning they’re linked to pregnancy; oftentimes, the tumor will even arise from an abnormal and non-viable pregnancy. But the woman’s cancer was a non-gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGOC), which only accounts for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328112/"&gt;0.6%&lt;/a&gt; of all reported ovarian germ cell tumors (a germ cell being the actual egg). What’s more, the cancer was a pure NGOC, an “exceedingly rare” subtype made completely out of germ cells and not any other kinds of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An image of the woman’s tumor, as well as her uterus and a benign ovarian cyst, can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/output/cache/622/F3.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but be warned, it’s not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these cancers aren’t tied to pregnancy, they do cause the body to produce high levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Women also produce high levels of hCG during pregnancy, and some tests detect pregnancy through measuring hCG, explaining the woman’s positive result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NGOC is a rare, distinct, and highly aggressive tumor that predominantly affects young, reproductive-aged women,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in this case, the cancer appears to have been caught early enough in time. Following surgery, the woman was placed on chemotherapy. And her most recent tests showed that her hCG level had returned to normal, indicating a complete treatment response, according to the doctors. She will need to have regular follow-up tests, including CT imaging, to make sure the cancer isn’t staging an unwelcome comeback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fine particulate matter, which is about 30 times smaller than the width of a strand of human hair, can seep indoors from automobiles and factories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Paraphrasing below: Breathing in traffic pollution can put stress on the body by raising heart rate and tightening blood vessels. Over time, it can also damage the arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure, according to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/karishma-patwa-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Karishma Patwa, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified cardiologist at Manhattan Cardiology.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Air pollution is often discussed in terms of outdoor sources, but cooking and smoking indoors also add to particulate matter pollution, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/sarath-raju/2704329" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarath Raju, MD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, a pulmonologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People in the U.S. spend about 90% of their time indoors. Exposure to indoor air pollutants can cause headaches, dizziness, eye irritation, respiratory diseases, heart issues, and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Older adults and people with underlying heart issues, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol levels have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems from particulate matter air pollution.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting an air purifier is one way to reduce indoor air pollution.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Even if you don't live near a high traffic area, I would consider this a strategy, particularly in vulnerable populations who may face greater risk for adverse cardiovascular effects or have greater risk for lung disease from my air pollution exposure," Raju said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to get an air purifier for your home, look for one with a HEPA filter, which is effective against most harmful particles in the air.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Carbon filter can also reduce certain gases, so finding a purifier with both is ideal, Raju said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He added that other ways to lower indoor air pollution exposure include not smoking inside, keeping windows closed during high-pollution days, and using an induction stove instead of a gas stove.&lt;br&gt;

A 2023 study of nearly 1,000 adults by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine compared the rate of cognitive decline over a three-year period between people who did and didn't receive hearing aids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hearing aids could slash the risk of dementia by almost two thirds, new findings suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers found those who received hearing aids had a 48 percent reduction in the rate of cognitive decline compared with people who didn't get the devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Professor Frank Lin, of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, said: 'These results provide compelling evidence that treating hearing loss is a powerful tool to protect cognitive function in later life, and possibly, over the long term, delay a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But any cognitive benefits of treating age-related hearing loss are likely to vary depending on an individual's risk of cognitive decline.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with hearing loss putting an increased workload on the brain, Professor Lin believes that it can also make people feel more isolated and less socially engaged, which can contribute to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'When you have hearing loss, you may not be as socially engaged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You may become more lonely or withdrawn. One thing we know about risk of dementia and cognitive decline is that if people don't remain engaged with cognitively stimulating activities, it is not good for the brain.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has been strongly linked to neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, but it has so far been unclear whether it is a symptom or one of the causes behind the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought to be caused by a build-up of amyloid and tau in the brain, which clump together and from plaques and tangles that make it harder for the brain to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is more&lt;span&gt; prevalent among females, with around two-thirds of cases occurring in women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased risk among women is attributed to a combination of factors, including women's longer life expectancy, hormonal changes associated with menopause, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other risks for dementia include high blood pressure, lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and uncontrolled diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids can be purchased directly from retail stores or online without a prescription or professional fitting by an audiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, audiologists can also provide prescription-strength hearing aids, which may be necessary for more severe hearing loss or for those who prefer a customized fitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many warning signs of dementia are often confused with normal aging. Common early symptoms include forgetfulness, repeating themselves, sudden changes in mood, inability to speak, and personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite them being readily available, many people still don't seek help or wear hearing aids because of the perceived stigma around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, with technological advancements and a growing preference for sleek, discreet designs, hearing aids are becoming increasingly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hearing aids market is expected to reach $45.68 billion by 2031, an increase from $28.75 billion in 2024, which experts say is largely due to an aging population.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has suggested hearing loss can contribute to a faster rate of brain wasting as well as prompt social isolation – another known risk factor of mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also believe it may also make the brain work harder to the detriment of other mental functions like thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mitochondria may be the powerhouse of the cell, but mounting evidence suggests this organelle is also a driving force behind cancer. Now, new evidence points to the mitochondrial metabolite glutathione, highlighting its central role in helping breast cancer cells break away from the primary tumor, travel through the body, and take root in other tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings are among the first to link a specific mitochondrial &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolite/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolite&lt;/a&gt; to metastasis, with strong implications for the study of cancer at the cellular level. "We hope that our work will bring more attention to how organelles and their metabolites are relevant to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+biology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer biology&lt;/a&gt;," says Kivanç Birsoy, head of the Laboratory of Metabolic Regulation and Genetics at Rockefeller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mysterious connection with metastasis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of cancer deaths are due to its spread, rather than complications from the original tumor. Knowing that metastasis lies at the heart of cancer mortality, researchers have spent decades trying to identify—and defeat—the specific factors that enable rogue cells to break away from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/primary+tumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primary tumor&lt;/a&gt; and colonize the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolites play a key role, with prior studies having shown that the metabolites lactate, pyruvate, glutamine, and serine each support distinct stages of metastasis. And since mitochondria within the cancer cell are responsible for not only generating energy but also providing metabolites, it is unsurprising that a handful of recent studies have linked mitochondrial activity to metastasis in breast, renal, and pancreatic cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, researchers had been unable to identify the precise mechanisms at play. "Mitochondria have thousands of metabolites, and it's been difficult to determine which are important to tumor formation and growth, and which initiate metastasis," says Birsoy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Cells under stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, now &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-24-1556/763897/Mitochondrial-glutathione-import-enables-breast" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/i&gt;, Birsoy and colleagues utilized an innovative strategy that involved protein tagging able to distinguish primary tumor cells from those that had migrated from the breast to the lung. The team, led by graduate fellow Nicole DelGaudio and postdoctoral fellow Hsi-wen Yeh, then analyzed the metabolites in these organelles to reveal how mitochondrial metabolites shift when cancer cells colonize new sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These techniques allowed us to, in an unbiased manner, see the difference between what's essential in metastasis and what's essential in the primary tumor," DelGaudio says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among thousands of mitochondrial compounds, one stood out: &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glutathione/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glutathione&lt;/a&gt;. A major antioxidant involved in reducing oxidative stress, enhancing metabolic detoxification, and regulating the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, glutathione levels were found to have skyrocketed in metastatic cancer cells that invaded the lung. To further confirm the findings, the team used a spatial metabolomics technique that allowed them to visualize the distribution of glutathione directly within lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then shifted their focus toward mitochondrial membrane proteins, screening for transporters that stood out as essential for metastatic cells growing in the lung. Once again, a clear frontrunner emerged: SLC25A39, the mitochondrial glutathione transporter. The findings closed the loop, linking a metabolite and its transporter to metastasis by demonstrating that mitochondrial glutathione import via the SLC25A39 transporter is essential for cancer spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birsoy and colleagues also found how mitochondrial glutathione drives cancer spread: not by acting as an antioxidant—an effect ruled out through multiple experiments—but by signaling to activate ATF4, a transcription factor that helps cancer cells survive in low-oxygen conditions. This also pinpointed when glutathione is specifically required: during the early steps of metastatic colonization, when cancer cells adapt rapidly to the stressful environment of a new tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;A familiar culprit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work builds on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-06-qa-discusses-nutrients-body-cancer.html"&gt;recent significant work&lt;/a&gt; from the Birsoy lab. In 2021, his team was the first to demonstrate that SLC25A39 is the transporter that brings glutathione into the mitochondria; in 2023, they showed that SLC25A39 is not only a transporter but a dynamic sensor that regulates the amount of glutathione in the mitochondria and adjusts those levels accordingly. So when this metabolite and its mitochondrial transporter showed up in cancer screenings, Birsoy knew where to take his experiments next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because we found this transporter earlier and knew how to block the entry of glutathione, we already had the tools necessary to investigate its role in cancer metastasis," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings may have clinical implications—especially since the team also found that breast cancer samples from patients whose disease had spread to the lung showed elevated SLC25A39, and that higher SLC25A39 expression was strongly correlated with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. One day, a small molecule that targets this metabolite by blocking its transporter could potentially forestall breast cancer metastasis, with fewer side effects than sweeping therapies that target more general cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, however, the paper emphasizes the importance of nailing down just how metabolites within different compartments operate within our cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to make our knowledge of metabolism more precise," Birsoy says. "It's not just about some metabolite levels going up and others going down. We need to look at the organelles, the precise compartments, to understand how metabolites influence human health."&lt;/p&gt;

The cumulative incidence of long COVID among reinfected and non-reinfected participants was 11.1% and 8.2% in the post-index year, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those vaccinated between first infection and index faced lower risks of long COVID from reinfection than those only vaccinated prior to their first infection, suggesting that more recent vaccinations may lower the risk of long COVID following reinfections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among patients similar to those who got COVID-19 again, reinfections resulted in a 35% increase in the risk of developing long COVID (risk ratio [RR], 1.35; absolute risk difference [aRD], 0.029). The finding held across most stratifications, including sex and timing and severity of first infection, but differed by age-group. The youngest groups had lower aRDs (ages 18 to 25 years, 0.011; 26 to 35, 0.019) than older groups (36 to 50, 0.034; 51 to 65, 0.037; 66 and older, 0.036).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The subanalysis found overlapping risk ratios for most vaccination groups, but risk was generally lower among those vaccinated after their first infection but before the index date (RR, 1.19) and before the first infection and pre-index date (RR, 1.21). RRs were higher for participants vaccinated before their first infection but not pre-index (RR, 1.45) or not at all (RR, 1.33).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Those vaccinated between first infection and index faced lower risks of long COVID from reinfection than those only vaccinated prior to their first infection, suggesting that more recent vaccinations may lower the risk of long COVID following reinfections," the study authors wrote. "However, this effect was not consistent across all groups."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Vaccinated individuals tended to be older with more comorbidities and utilization, resulting in higher overall incidences of long COVID," they added. "More research is needed to discern how vaccination modulates the likelihood of a reinfection to lead to long COVID."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Those guest rooms include 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individuals who meet the risk criteria for a rabies exposure will be connected with the appropriate provider in their home state for preventive treatment," park officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guests who think they've been exposed can contact Grand Teton Lodge Company at RoomsGTLC@vailresorts.com or (307) 543-3044. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park officials said bat exposure can include a bite or scratch from bats, bat saliva coming in contact with an open wound or other physical contact with a bat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since bat teeth are so small, it may be difficult to determine if a bite or scratch occurred, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rabies virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms — which can take weeks to months to incubate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first symptoms of rabies may be like the flu, including weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache, the CDC said. There also may be discomfort, prickling or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe rabies disease symptoms usually appear within two weeks of the first symptoms, when the rabies virus causes anxiety, confusion, agitation and hallucinations, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

Using the gold-standard Navigation Guide review method, the team analyzed 46 studies with over 100,000 participants, finding that stronger studies more consistently showed a connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the evidence does not prove causation, it highlights biological mechanisms such as oxidative stress and hormone disruption that may affect fetal brain development. Researchers recommend cautious, time-limited use under medical supervision and call for safer treatment alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; Review covered 46 studies and more than 100,000 participants worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger studies more often found links between prenatal acetaminophen and autism/ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Results urge caution, medical oversight, and safer alternatives for expectant mothers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Environmental Health&lt;/em&gt;, is the first to apply the rigorous Navigation Guide methodology to systematically evaluate the rigor and quality of the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen (often sold under the brand name Tylenol®, and known as paracetamol outside the United States and Canada) is the most commonly used over-the-counter pain and fever medication during pregnancy and is used by more than half of pregnant women worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology is a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows researchers to assess and rate each study’s risk of bias, such as selective reporting of the outcomes or incomplete data, as well as the strength of the evidence and the quality of the studies individually and collectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD,” said Diddier Prada, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Population Health Science and Policy, and Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper also explores biological mechanisms that could explain the association between acetaminophen use and these disorders. Acetaminophen is known to cross the placental barrier and may trigger oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and cause epigenetic changes that interfere with fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not show that acetaminophen directly causes neurodevelopmental disorders, the research team’s findings strengthen the evidence for a connection and raise concerns about current clinical practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call for cautious, time-limited use of acetaminophen during pregnancy under medical supervision; updated clinical guidelines to better balance the benefits and risks; and further research to confirm these findings and identify safer alternatives for managing pain and fever in expectant mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,” Dr. Prada emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers and considering non-drug options whenever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With diagnoses of autism and ADHD increasing worldwide, these findings have significant implications for public health policy, clinical guidelines, and patient education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the urgent need for pharmaceutical innovation to provide safer alternatives for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H.

Due to substantial heterogeneity, we opted for a qualitative synthesis, consistent with the Navigation Guide’s focus on environmental health evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 46 studies for inclusion in our analysis. Of these, 27 studies reported positive associations (significant links to NDDs), 9 showed null associations (no significant link), and 4 indicated negative associations (protective effects). Higher-quality studies were more likely to show positive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses using the Navigation Guide thus support evidence consistent with an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs. Appropriate and immediate steps should be taken to advise pregnant women to limit acetaminophen consumption to protect their offspring’s neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:32:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5lMzN1aTc5WjRfWHpKWEU0VWphWF9Ed3VvekhGdlA3X0xrVFBCUnVJeE92bnRtQjBFbWl1ajJERThoMmlkUzR6aGppU1FUNWFIdWp6am5GejJnczBjck1TWkxZZWNPZ3NXZ2c4aW1B</guid></item></channel></rss>
