They are a major breakthrough for people to shed pounds and manage conditions such as Type 2 diabetes. However, doctors say there’s a perception that weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are all you need to live a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWIMJOECNZAE5IZ3SJFGHONVJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diet and exercise still matter, said &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/" target="_blank"&gt;JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OYW2YZIQ5CFVEJICEG7KSWMGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They remain crucial,” Manson said. “If you’re not paying attention to protein intake, hydration and having regular physical activity — especially resistance training — you can end up with poor nutritional status and substantial muscle loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDGKSFGJFZDJVOWQ5PYVL7UIG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone the body produces to regulate hunger and blood sugar. The injections cut cravings for food, slow digestion and keep people feeling full for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NCTCHFXSFBHJATCL42UVVZB3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, since the drugs affect the stomach’s functions, they also can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Some people stop taking the drugs because of these gut symptoms. Still, Manson said, with some “relatively straightforward” changes in behavior, people can minimize these problems and continue using the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LNBG5PEWOZF6FM6JXBQR5BJWIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson is a co-author of two articles — one for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2836533?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=0" target="_blank"&gt;clinicians&lt;/a&gt; and another for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1133?guestAccessKey=36da2db9-78f9-4823-be41-f21c6fa9a614&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=071425" target="_blank"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; — that were recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Here are five things Manson and her co-authors want people on these medications&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6YOC7MW65VCC3COE6EOPV2DFF4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6YOC7MW65VCC3COE6EOPV2DFF4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;1. The weight you lose might include muscle, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGY3QHDK45EGVAUDE5HDNIPPR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These medications can help someone lose around 15 to 21 percent of their body weight. But a significant portion of that weight — up to one-fourth — can be lean body mass and muscle, Manson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;2. It can help to start every meal with 20 to 30 grams of protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVPDC2XBLVEH5NM6ZMUG5YYC3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This protein can come&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from chicken, fish, beans, chickpeas or tofu, Manson said. Aim for 1 to 1.5 grams of protein each day per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. If you don’t have an appetite or are eating smaller meals, you may want to try drinking a protein shake throughout the day as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUUXS3V6PBFAFPUSQEDFVP2BRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson and her co-authors suggest filling a plate this way: half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter protein, and the rest whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;3. Resistance training two to three times a week can build muscle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QUAOAF2FIRDKFLBEELXHTE33SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can strengthen your muscles with bands, weights and body-weight exercises to counteract the potential loss in lean body mass, Manson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FF2DQC2ZRZBEFM2Z7237T2ZMWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Aim for 60 to 90 minutes of resistance training and 150 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="L22O7IOSFJBILNCVBCAW2YM3L4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="L22O7IOSFJBILNCVBCAW2YM3L4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;4. It’s a good idea to drink more water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KADHMNVAYVCTPMOBFEGIDV7SXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Water can help with the dehydration and constipation associated with the weight-loss drugs, said Manson, who recommended 8 to 12 glasses per day. You also can eat water-rich foods such as cucumbers and watermelon to stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BYQVV36EU5ACLIYYPUBOALXTOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the researchers recommend that people on GLP-1 drugs limit their intake of alcohol, caffeine, and sugary or artificially sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AOWXQZZNWBCGDCTH7BK4QF4XEQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AOWXQZZNWBCGDCTH7BK4QF4XEQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5. You should avoid lying down for two to three hours after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XAX7WHZ2ZZCVVO4JE3256ZYWEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This may help reduce your risk of heartburn. Add fiber to help with constipation, and avoid high-fat foods — or fried foods — because they can worsen feelings of nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J2GTBHS25VDXLGZCXUW4LH2BSM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J2GTBHS25VDXLGZCXUW4LH2BSM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What do other experts say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3VYLU3XHFFCXE5YYJFKHVOBHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20189108" target="_blank"&gt;Andres J. Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic, who has also consulted for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and has co-founded two weight-loss-associated companies, Phenomix Sciences and Gila Therapeutics, said he often finds that patients have a “preconceived notion” that they just need to take the medication and they’ll lose weight. But the clinical trials for these weight-loss drugs included “comprehensive programs” with lifestyle interventions for a calorie-reduced diet and exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VBHME7KNWJF2HMJAWXEDOWS5BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This perception — just take the shot and don’t do anything else — is wrong. It’s not going to drive real, long-term behavioral changes,” said Acosta, who is a co-author of “The Mayo Clinic Diet: Weight-Loss Medications Edition.” “Patients aren’t going to see the outcomes that we’re seeing in the trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GOJZZAHGNDCJP7JKE65RRJVHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The GLP-1 medications are one tool in a broader weight-management program, Acosta said. He tells people they still need to have a healthy diet, with “a good amount of protein” and enough water to stay well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X5DQJIKESFGAFJJEXTHWMRT5IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I like to set the expectations from the get-go,” Acosta said. “And I also tell them that not everyone is going to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7VUYMBA75BCDPHEOKBUTQUYPYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people will gain back weight when they stop taking these medications, said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/exercise-and-nutrition-sciences/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/em1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Mietlicki-Baase&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the University of Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UPH742CWPRCD3BZQRA7GWY726Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers are interested in “finding strategies to prevent weight regain after discontinuation,” she said. “But we don’t have a great handle on that just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:31:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVF9tRk1vOFZ2dEZQSHM0ak83VF9ySmZldTNWaXdRbjk2WFNhbTlEbkFNTkdsQThLa2ZZT2plcnQ5YzRkeVdLa3c5LXVfakdFMzRTRlliaTJ4N3ppbTJjYXRhRmE1eDhLMnRIVUdSOHJhcy1LNnE0VHJIZS1kWTRsVE1iYmJ6NTJ4a0R3RVpySQ</guid></item><item><title>“癌症”一词会导致过度治疗和恐惧。我们应该放弃吗？ -永旺 | The word ‘cancer’ leads to overtreatment and fear.

His friend Isaiah Berlin called it a ‘dead secret’ – Austin himself had ‘no idea’ how little time was left. As Hilary term approached, Austin requested a mere four weeks’ leave until his glands ‘cleared up’. He died five weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Austin is best known for speech act theory, which teaches that language does not simply convey information but performs actions. In short, we &lt;em&gt;do things &lt;/em&gt;with words.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;One word, however, is conspicuously absent from Austin’s late correspondence. &lt;em&gt;Cancer. &lt;/em&gt;Lung cancer, Austin’s ‘grave’ diagnosis, claimed his life at &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;age 48.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many at the time, Austin’s doctors, family and friends avoided naming his disease. ‘Cancer’ was a whispered word, a taboo too terrible to speak. Physicians routinely withheld the diagnosis, fearing that merely uttering it would extinguish all hope and hasten death. As one writer observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cancer patients are lied to, not just because the disease is (or is thought to be) a death sentence, but because it is felt to be obscene – in the original meaning of that word: ill-omened, abominable, repugnant to the senses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That writer – Susan Sontag – like Austin, was an astute observer of the power of language. In &lt;em&gt;Illness as Metaphor&lt;/em&gt; (1978),&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Sontag exposed how metaphors surrounding illness, especially cancer, do more than describe; they shape perception, reinforce stigma, and impose narratives that can harm. She called for a ‘liberation’ from these metaphors, arguing that we must stop treating cancer as ‘an evil, invincible predator’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ontag died of cancer in 2004. By then, the narrative had shifted. When she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1975, there were no pink ribbons or ads urging early detection and treatment. By her death, however, cancer had moved from private affliction to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-breast-cancer-rips-up-conventional-markers-of-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Women marched in solidarity; men grew moustaches for Movember; athletes donned pink jerseys, while coloured wristbands signalled support for everything from leukaemia to pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer was no longer a shameful obscenity but a rallying cry. Shattering the silence was undoubtedly progress. But with this shift came new metaphors – and new expectations. No longer an unspeakable fate, cancer became a &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/should-we-abandon-the-idea-that-cancer-is-something-to-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;battle to be fought&lt;/a&gt;, with patients cast as warriors, urged to ‘Fight Like Hell’. Drive through any major city in the United States, and you’ll pass billboards with slogans: ‘We Fight for You’; ‘Your Battle Begins Here.’ Cancer centres &lt;em&gt;recruit &lt;/em&gt;patients, urging them to &lt;em&gt;enlist&lt;/em&gt;. Public health campaigns preach constant vigilance against a lurking enemy needing to be stamped out before it takes root. What was once too fearsome to name became a call to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many now worry the pendulum has swung too far. Overtreatment – intervening where it’s unlikely to help and likely to harm – has become a major problem in modern oncology. Take prostate cancer. In the US alone, more than 50,000 men are diagnosed each year with a low-risk instance of the disease. These cancers rarely spread, and observation is a safe approach, with outcomes equivalent to surgery or radiation. Yet more than half of patients still &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108645/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;undergo&lt;/a&gt; aggressive treatment, risking incontinence, impotence and other harms – without clear benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We treat not because it helps – but because the alternative feels like &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;giving up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns play out in other cancers. More than 50,000 women in the US are diagnosed annually with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive form of breast cancer with a low risk of progression. Yet nearly all undergo surgery, with a third receiving mastectomies. Trials have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39665585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that observation can be a safe alternative, but they struggled to recruit patients – and, even when they did, many crossed over to surgery. As one commentator &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29174412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, clinicians are conditioned to act, and patients have been ‘brought up to expect “cancer” to be removed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overtreatment doesn’t stop at early stage disease. In the US, it’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 700,000 people are living with advanced cancer. For many, the final stretch of life will be marked by intervention. One in three will &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6521896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; aggressive treatment in their last months, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in five&lt;/a&gt; will get chemotherapy in their final weeks. These treatments rarely prolong life and almost always diminish its quality, bringing exhaustion, nausea, hospital stays and lost time with loved ones. Despite guidelines discouraging such practices, the default remains action. We treat not because it helps – but because the alternative feels like &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;giving up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I see this firsthand. Patients hear the word ‘cancer’ and brace for battle. Some tell me they’ll accept anything – however toxic – if it means getting rid of the disease. Even when the evidence supports watching and waiting, the very idea can feel like surrender. And even when the evidence supports palliative care, many still choose to ‘fight to the bitter end’. To &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.00081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; one patient: ‘Doing nothing is no choice&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;’ Clinicians, too, feel pressure to intervene. The urgency doesn’t come from disease biology – it comes from the weight of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why some oncologists now &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436144/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that we should &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30813118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; the ‘dreaded C-word’: removing the cancer label from low-risk cases like early breast and prostate cancers could spare patients unnecessary treatment. We’ve come full circle – but for the opposite reason. What Austin’s doctors withheld to preserve hope, today’s oncologists would withhold to prevent us from doing too much. It’s a tempting solution to a serious problem. Cancer overtreatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847639/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;harms&lt;/a&gt; millions and drains billions from healthcare systems every year. But is &lt;em&gt;renaming&lt;/em&gt; really the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o begin to unpack this, we can turn to Austin and his theory of speech acts. Imagine you’re diagnosed with a disease. It started with a yellowing toenail. Your doctor examines you, then says: ‘You have &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X.’&lt;/span&gt; It’s slow growing, she explains, though it may spread. There’s a treatment, but it has side-effects. Some patients, she says, choose to live with &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X.&lt;/span&gt; You consider your options, opt for treatment, and are cured. You never think of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X&lt;/span&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a different diagnosis. This one began with a lump in your groin. Your doctor runs some tests, then breaks the news: ‘You have &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y.’&lt;/span&gt; You shudder at the words. She tries to reassure you: it’s slow growing but can spread over time. The treatment has side-effects. But many patients, she adds, find it hard to live with &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y.&lt;/span&gt; She refers you to a support group, where you hear of patients who fought &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; and won. You choose treatment and achieve remission. You remain an active member of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; community. You see yourself as a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; survivor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X&lt;/span&gt; and Y? Between onychomycosis, a fungal toenail infection, and an indolent lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph nodes? Yes, they differ in prognosis. But perhaps the most striking difference lies elsewhere. It lies in what Austin calls &lt;em&gt;illocutionary force&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illocutionary force is what words do in the very act of saying them – they create commitments, reshape roles, and influence identities. Take ‘I promise’: those two words don’t just express an intention; they create an obligation. Or take ‘You are guilty.’ Uttered by a judge, those words don’t just assign blame – they make you a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The fighter effect is a powerful driver of overtreatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the words ‘You have cancer’ do more than simply state a medical fact. A cancer diagnosis, like a guilty verdict, carries special illocutionary force. It doesn’t just describe a condition; it imposes a new identity. In short, it makes you &lt;em&gt;a cancer patient&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just a patient – &lt;em&gt;a fighter&lt;/em&gt;. ‘Conquer Cancer.’ ‘Fight Like Hell.’ These slogans don’t just inspire; they instruct. They set expectations: show strength, not weakness; determination, not passivity; persistence, not surrender; action, not inaction. Cancer isn’t just a diagnosis – it’s a call to arms. We can give this special illocutionary force a name. Let’s call it &lt;em&gt;the fighter effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighter effect is a powerful driver of overtreatment. It’s what leads men with low-risk prostate cancer to undergo unnecessary prostatectomies. It’s what drives women with indolent breast lesions to receive mastectomies they may not need. And it’s what pushes patients with advanced disease to trade precious time for ineffective treatments at the end of life. The word ‘cancer’ demands action. In the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23136314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of one patient: ‘Something has got to be done.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising cancer’s illocutionary force brings into focus two competing strategies for tackling overtreatment: &lt;em&gt;renaming &lt;/em&gt;versus &lt;em&gt;reframing.&lt;/em&gt; Proponents of renaming – those who argue that we should drop the ‘dreaded &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word’&lt;/span&gt; and simply call early cancers something else – focus on blocking the immediate impact of cancer’s illocutionary force. By leaving the word unsaid, they aim to prevent the fighter effect from taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a bit like building dams to stop flooding. It may protect some areas, but it doesn’t address the source of rising waters. The social and cultural currents that drive overtreatment remain, ready to surge again. To truly tackle overtreatment, we need a different strategy. Instead of building local dams, we must quell the rising waters. Rather than renaming the diagnosis, we must &lt;em&gt;reframe&lt;/em&gt; its force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o reframe cancer’s illocutionary force means shifting the linguistic and social practices that give the word its power. It rejects the narrative that cancer demands a fight, aiming to disarm – rather than simply block – its illocutionary force. It creates space for treatment decisions to be guided by risks, benefits and patient preferences rather than by bellicose expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why reframe rather than simply rename? There are at least three compelling reasons. The first is that reframing targets the root cause of overtreatment. Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24807866/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that renaming early cancers with terms like IDLE (‘indolent lesion of epithelial origin’) may lead fewer patients to choose unnecessary treatment. But this is like trying to solve vaccine hesitancy by simply replacing the word ‘vaccine’ with a catchy acronym – say, BIBBLES (‘biological immunity boosting with bonafide, longitudinally established safety’).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Clearly, that just skirts the issue. Renaming may block overtreatment in one instance, but it leaves the underlying misperception intact: that every cancer, regardless of risk, must be treated aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, renaming doesn’t just leave the misperception intact but reinforces it. Avoiding the term ‘cancer’ only feeds the narrative – shared by Austin’s doctors and critiqued by Sontag – that it’s something too terrible to name. Just as calling Voldemort He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named only intensifies his infamy, shying away from the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word&lt;/span&gt; cements cancer’s power. Renaming some cancers, while reserving the word for cases where ‘fighting’ is deemed appropriate, ultimately reinforces the very expectations that efforts to tackle overtreatment ought to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Reframing seeks to transform the norms and expectations around the diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason to prefer reframing is that it respects patient autonomy. Imagine you have an American friend, Amy, who hates zucchini. She’s not allergic or intolerant. She simply fears that eating zucchini will make her sick. Worried that Amy’s missing out on zucchini’s culinary delights, you prepare your finest ratatouille. Knowing she hates zucchini, you strategically tell her your ratatouille is made with ‘courgette’. (Schooled in American English, Amy is unfamiliar with zucchini’s British synonym.) She eats your ratatouille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, it’s plain that you’ve deceived Amy. You’ve prevented her from making an autonomous decision about whether to eat your ratatouille given her preferences. Even if you believe her fear is baseless, your deceit isn’t justified. A better friend would help Amy understand that zucchini won’t harm her so she can confidently enjoy the vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing aims to do just that: it addresses the fear directly, helping Amy see zucchini for what it really is. Renaming, by contrast, would have Amy eat ‘courgette’. This might be appropriate if she were your four-year-old daughter but it’s not appropriate for your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9760953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that renaming early cancers is paternalistic, infringing on patients’ right to make autonomous decisions. Members of the public have echoed these concerns, worrying that renaming feels deceitful. Though paternalism rightly raises red flags in modern medicine, it can sometimes be justified. Proponents of renaming defend it as a way to spare patients the emotional burden of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word,&lt;/span&gt; nudging them towards better choices. Yet this approach is ultimately flawed. It concedes that the fighter effect is problematic but does nothing to address it. As a result, patients whose conditions remain labelled ‘cancer’ are still subject to its full force, pushing them towards overly aggressive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing offers a better path. Instead of sidestepping the problem, it seeks to transform the norms and expectations that surround the diagnosis. In so doing, it respects autonomy across the board – empowering all patients to make informed, proportionate decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;When patients discover that their so-called ‘lesion’ used to be called cancer, trust erodes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third reason to choose reframing is that it’s more robust. By robust, I mean resilient to shifting tides of medical practice, testing regimes and human behaviour that can undermine efforts to curb overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider cancer screening. Recently, attempts to restrict mammography to women over 50 to prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment sparked widespread controversy, with conflicting guidelines, professional disputes and media uproar – what became &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/27/mammogram-recommendations-preventive-services-task-force-overdiagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; ‘the mammography wars’. Even where restrictive screening guidelines are adopted, adherence is patchy, influenced by personal biases and patient pressures. Meanwhile, emerging technologies like blood-based cancer-detection tests introduce new avenues for overdiagnosis, further complicating efforts to address overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaming might seem more robust: if we can’t stop doctors from finding early cancers that don’t require treatment, we could at least change what they’re called. Replacing ‘cancer’ with ‘lesion’ or ‘IDLE’ might sidestep the fighter effect and thereby reduce unnecessary interventions. But this strategy, too, is fragile. As any physician knows, and as I’ve seen time and again in my own practice, such euphemisms inevitably prompt the further question. To borrow a line from the 1960 movie &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s Eleven&lt;/em&gt;: ‘Look, doc. Give it to me straight. Is this the big casino?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when patients discover that their so-called ‘lesion’ used to be called cancer, trust erodes. And, in that moment of discovery, the full illocutionary force of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word&lt;/span&gt; re-enters – often with a vengeance. When Amy Googles ‘courgette’, she won’t be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing is a more robust solution. Instead of relying on fragile euphemisms, it directly challenges the fighter effect – the underlying social forces that drive overtreatment. Rather than waging battles over labels, it aims to change the way we think and talk about cancer altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;hanging the way we think and talk about cancer might seem like a lofty, even impossible goal. But as Austin scholars have &lt;a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/langton2015/langton2015_ALP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; out, illocutionary forces are not immutable. They are shaped and sustained by social conventions. A promise carries weight because society enforces the expectation to keep one’s word. A guilty verdict gains significance through laws and institutions, and through how society views the crime. These are not set in stone. Change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of a cancer diagnosis. Shifting illocutionary force means changing the conventions that give it power – moving away from seeing every cancer as a battle to be won at all costs, and toward treating it like other diseases, where decisions carefully consider a patient’s preferences, along with the risks and benefits of different options. That shift requires action across many fronts. Doctors must reconsider how they present the diagnosis, replacing militarised metaphors with language that emphasises patient agency. Public health campaigns must move beyond combative imagery, crafting messages that inform and empower without resorting to fear to drive decisions. Cancer centres, research institutions and media outlets all have a role to play in dismantling norms that perpetuate the fighter effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sontag, many have called for such changes. Austin’s insights lend new clarity to these calls, showing us why and how change should occur. Seeing the diagnosis of cancer as a speech act with powerful illocutionary force – capable of shaping norms, expectations, even identity – reveals that overtreatment can’t simply be contained by renaming specific cancers. Overtreatment isn’t just a medical issue, but a social and cultural one too. To change how we treat cancer, we must rethink the illocutionary force that surrounds the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sontag herself saw this clearly. She even lived through an important shift in that force. The unspeakable, ‘grave’ diagnosis that killed Austin had, by the time it claimed Sontag, become nameable, visible – even public. That was progress. But it wasn’t the liberation she’d &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;hoped for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Too many patients are convinced that stopping treatment or choosing palliation means surrender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d incisively critiqued cancer’s earlier metaphors of silence and despair, yet wasn’t immune to its newer ones. As her son David Rieff recounts in his memoir &lt;em&gt;Swimming in a Sea of Death&lt;/em&gt; (2008), following her diagnosis Sontag became a ‘militant propagandist for more rather than less treatment’, pursuing extraordinarily aggressive regimens – first for breast cancer, and later for the leukaemia that followed. Though ‘less is more’ captured her artistic sensibility, Rieff writes: ‘when it came to cancer treatments more was always better.’ By today’s standards, much of her treatment would be considered excessive – its toxicity likely contributing to the second cancer that ultimately claimed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after her bone marrow transplant failed, Sontag refused to stop. She remained determined to ‘fight for her life to the very end’, rejecting any talk of palliation and pressing her doctors to continue. As her son movingly recalls, it was ‘the opposite of an easy death’ – a slow, painful end, ‘stripped of her dignity’ and ‘unreconciled to her own extinction’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician treating patients with blood cancers, I’ve seen how too many still face a similar fate, convinced that stopping treatment, choosing palliation – or even death itself – means surrender. As one patient with advanced cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36573958/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: ‘If I were to die, which I most likely will, then I’m a failure, I’m weak, I’m not a good fighter.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaphors have changed – but their force endures. Though stigma has given way to slogans, true liberation means casting off these narratives altogether. It means reframing cancer’s illocutionary force so that it’s no longer a death sentence or a battle cry but a diagnosis – one that, like any other, demands deliberation, not action by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We should all be free to attach our own meanings to the experience of illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to deny that a cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The words ‘You have cancer’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;often signal life-altering challenges ahead. Cancer remains a leading cause of death, claiming far too many lives – many younger than Sontag and even Austin, whose enduring contributions to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/susan-sontag-was-a-monster-of-the-very-best-kind" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-thought-acts-of-the-oxford-don-j-l-austin-live-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; were tragically cut short by the disease. Early detection and effective treatment – sadly, unavailable to Austin and ultimately unsuccessful for Sontag – can and do saves lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even with advances in therapy, most cancers remain difficult to cure, and treatments remain long and arduous. In the face of such hardships, some might see the fighter effect as a source of strength, helping them endure a difficult treatment cycle or pursue early intervention. Some patients may choose to embrace the identity of ‘fighter’; others of ‘traveller’; others of something entirely different. We should all be free to attach our own meanings to the experience of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To argue for reframing cancer’s illocutionary force is not to deny the gravity of the disease, the benefits of early treatment, or the hardships faced by patients. It’s to question whether the expectation to ‘fight’ should be baked into the very act of diagnosing cancer. Patients already grapple with complex decisions – navigating treatment options, weighing side-effects, and considering what it all means. They should not be further burdened by pressures to ‘fight’ because of the force of words. Decoupling the fighter effect from the cancer diagnosis allows patients to make their own informed choices – choices that weigh risks and benefits, not words. Only by shifting these norms can we achieve the kind of liberation that Sontag envisioned – it’s the only way to truly ‘de-mythicise’ cancer so that patients are free to shape their own identities and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Austin reminds us, we &lt;em&gt;do things &lt;/em&gt;with words. Words have the power to create norms, establish expectations, and shape identities. This power is rooted in linguistic and social conventions – conventions that, as Austin and Sontag well knew, are never fixed. In Austin’s day, cancer was an unspeakable diagnosis; in Sontag’s, it became a battle cry. Both were shaped by the language of their time. And both, in different ways, suffered under its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we stand at a different moment. Patients with cancer needn’t suffer in silence – but neither should they be summoned to war. If we are to carry forward Austin’s insights and realise Sontag’s vision, we must change not just the volume but the force of the word ‘cancer’. It shouldn’t be whispered. Nor shouted. It should be spoken clearly and calmly – so that patients can face a cancer diagnosis with autonomy, unburdened by expectation. To truly tackle overtreatment, we shouldn’t avoid the word ‘cancer’. We should transform what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 10:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQTUxRTVNKRE1GallMOXFQNVBMNzFpRFZSbzNqWnQ5ZU9FOElVbXBSNGxSSkJCdnFGcmF4cXZSV3c2MXJwRzF1eW9uYXVGNkc3M19sMXU4LThlLU1ubkxBV0FDLXJLRzVmNUM3Ykd1OHBjQlV3OV9kUGNSa2xld3JwYkdIWnZ3ZGMwMXJCUkdRZ21vZw</guid></item><item><title>Benadryl的危害大于好处吗？ -《纽约时报》 | Does Benadryl Do More Harm Than Good? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE04bXBMMThhLUtnZ3FLVkYyM3ZjbEVQbGswOXJ5UHp6T0VGS2hyU01vRTV3V0FHaGRtRFlQaGc0SmladFlXSDdROS1JeU5aNW9uaFE0OTd2THhuTWxWUGlHUHJfRFpxZ3VVWFRZd0xFakFLeFF6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 09:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE04bXBMMThhLUtnZ3FLVkYyM3ZjbEVQbGswOXJ5UHp6T0VGS2hyU01vRTV3V0FHaGRtRFlQaGc0SmladFlXSDdROS1JeU5aNW9uaFE0OTd2THhuTWxWUGlHUHJfRFpxZ3VVWFRZd0xFakFLeFF6</guid></item><item><title>由于纽约市敦促接种疫苗，全国麻疹病例达到33年来的最高水平- Gothamist | Measles cases reach 33-year high nationwide as NYC urges vaccination - Gothamist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQWkt0VU9aVE14bG1pTEUxWExGcnd5MUp4TVpWWXJmcnV4ekhXZVRFTHJ2dktBWGxlMDJMOS16dExuT0pPb3JRdVNjbTZRWnpsaXk5SWNtWmdMdGg4Qi13YlQxSGxEZnpIRFNSQXBhV1BiazZqS2FvZ25Rak1peGxFa3lTYUFIMEdNZGpmbjJjSEhBUEt1TWwxd2tmdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c0fvt"&gt;New York City hasn’t had any measles outbreaks yet this year, even as cases nationwide hit a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;33-year high&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; But individual cases continue to be reported and officials continue to urge vaccination and caution in a city that helped drive a major spike in cases in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="92esc"&gt;Seven cases of measles have been reported in the five boroughs so far this year, with the most recent confirmed in early July, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city health department updates&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to build strength but find yourself gazing forlornly at a pair of light dumbbells, wondering how they can help, I have good news. Research suggests that it doesn’t matter how light or heavy you lift, so long as you lift to the point of near failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the lesson recently shared by certified trainer, Technogym ambassador and friend of the show James Stirling, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/london_fitness_guy/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/london_fitness_guy/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;London Fitness Guy&lt;/a&gt; to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing to one small &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853914/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853914/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 18 well-trained young men, Stirling wrote that lifting light weights for 25-35 reps or heavy weights for 8-12 reps produced a similar muscle growth response so long as “the set was taken to the point where only 1-2 reps were left in the tank”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people say heavy [weights build more muscle] but the research says both work, as long as you’re pushing close to failure,” he added, while pictured wielding a heavy and light dumbbell in the accompanying video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;, did however, find high-load resistance training to be superior for maximizing strength adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling’s assertion neatly aligns with another &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484/version/620" target="_blank" data-url="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484/version/620" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;more recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; by the same lead author that was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad J Schoenfeld and his fellow authors found that lifting weights within two reps of the point of failure, known as two &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve"&gt;reps in reserve&lt;/a&gt; (RiR), was the winning formula to build muscular endurance &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-C3REsZc7oivv3wHoC7m7kW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-C3REsZc7oivv3wHoC7m7kW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better still, the researchers, led by author Tom Hermann, found just two 30-minute sessions of resistance training a week is plenty to build size and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-you-know-when-you-re-close-to-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you know when you’re close to failure? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting close to failure taps into the principle of progressive overload, in which you consistently challenge yourself to lift near your maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeating this process week upon week forces your muscles to adapt and become stronger. Muscle fibres grow, ligaments and tendons become more resilient, and strength increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you know for sure when you're close to failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling has two telltale signs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weight starts slowing down when you’re lifting it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like your muscles are on fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like your car’s fuel warning light,” he writes. “Stop just before you're empty, not when you’re cruising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-stirling-s-light-weights-workout-to-build-full-body-muscle"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use Stirling’s light weights workout to build full-body muscle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, I asked Stirling for one of his favorite full-body workouts that can be practised with whatever weights you have at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His session includes seven exercises, four of them combined into two supersets to keep muscles under increased tension if you’re making the most of light dumbbells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perform three sets of each exercise, working close to failure on each,” Stirling tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. Rest for one minute between sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supersets, perform one set of exercise A, then move straight onto exercise B. After you finish the set of exercise B, rest for one minute, then return to exercise A and continue that pattern until you’ve completed three sets of each exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the moves, with either a link to our exercise guide, or a guide on our former sister site &lt;em&gt;Coach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember that you should take each set close to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will ensure enough load to build muscle, regardless of rep range, making this workout convenient if you want to try it at home or if equipment is limited,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ensure you follow the principle of progressive overload,” he adds. “When it feels comfortable, increase the weights. Aim for small progressions in reps or the weights you lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Or add more volume each week by increasing the number of sets you complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3invi800203b6n2d2vxtle@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An estimated 14.3 million children globally remain completely unvaccinated, according to a new report, and public health experts point to conflict zones as threatening childhood vaccination efforts worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000a3b6nke2aenyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each year, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund publish a comprehensive report on estimates of national immunization coverage, based on data from 195 countries. This year’s report, released Monday, says there have been some improvements in protecting children against certain diseases through routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000c3b6nut62ppb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, 171,000 fewer children remained unvaccinated last year than in 2023, according to the report. But that still leaves more than 14 million children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and an additional 5.7 million with only partial protection because they may not have gotten all the recommended doses of certain vaccine series.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000d3b6nqgulb1dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The latest estimates highlight a really concerning trajectory,” Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000e3b6n2uzcfsfy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The global vision is for everyone everywhere to benefit from lifesaving vaccines,” she said. “But we’ve hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000f3b6n91yn05y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rising conflicts and war zones emerging around the world have eroded some of the progress in providing children with immunizations, she added, leading to many children remaining unvaccinated, especially in low- or middle-income countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000g3b6nagwvegl6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children living in one of 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict or humanitarian emergencies are three times more likely to be unvaccinated compared to children who live in stable countries,” O’Brien said. “In fact, half of all children unvaccinated in the world live in these fragile, vulnerable and conflict countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000h3b6nz26p4hqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report says that last year, nine countries – Nigeria, India, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola – accounted for 52% of all children who have never received a dose of vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000j3b6ntw95iffc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, mostly in high-income countries, vaccine coverage has been affected by vaccine hesitancy and distrust in institutions, leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles and polio, said Dr. Ephrem Lemango, UNICEF’s associate director for health and global chief of immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000k3b6niclvxt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Based on all we know, over the past 50 years, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years" target="_blank"&gt;over 150 million lives were saved through vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and this has been able to protect children from any forms of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Lemango said at the briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000l3b6nze3nadqo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But misinformation and any forms of vaccine hesitance is a reflection of a broader lack of trust or mistrust in the systems that deliver the vaccines, in the health workers that provide the vaccines and in the manufacturing facilities or the ecosystems that manufacture the vaccines,” he said. “So it is important to see misinformation or lack of information as part of a broader ecosystem to be able to address.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000m3b6nkl15urlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation appears to be driving outbreaks of disease in pockets of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;countries that tend to have high vaccination rates, O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000n3b6nujg1soyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are communities sort of hidden under that national number that have very low vaccination coverage, and that’s where outbreaks are happening, and those children are the ones who are suffering,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hag3m00003b6ndbds8mcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, a measles outbreak that originated in a part of West Texas that has a low vaccination rate continues to spread, and there have been more measles cases reported in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000o3b6nw2oij7ua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But O’Brien added that while the effects of misinformation remain concerning, they are not the main reason millions of children remain unvaccinated globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000p3b6nu4mxj23e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main reason, when you look worldwide, why children aren’t vaccinated is because of access to vaccines and access to vaccination services – and this is where it’s particularly important,” O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000q3b6naqqed164@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not being vaccinated because they don’t have access,” she said. “They’re in dangerous settings, it’s hard to gain access to them, and in some situations, the government does not have access to those environments.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000s3b6ny6x939sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report comes amid growing concern about funding for global vaccination efforts. The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, which has partnered with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to provide vaccines. And the US has announced plans to reduce funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000t3b6nak8u37mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have a lot of work to do,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release. “Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress. WHO remains committed to working with our partners to support countries to develop local solutions and increase domestic investment to reach all children with the lifesaving power of vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000v3b6n8bypac94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report says that in 2024, protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis remained constant, as an estimated 89% of infants globally received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, the same share as in 2023 and 2022. Roughly 85% completed all three recommended doses of vaccine last year, compared to 84% in 2023 and 85% in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000x3b6nzcdkofgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of children receiving their first dose of measles vaccine remained relatively constant last year, at 84%, compared to 83% in 2023 and 2022. But that share is lower than in 2019, when coverage was 86%, according to the new report. Overall, the report says, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00103b6nq21fumza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, the global percentage of children receiving their second dose of measles vaccine increased from 73% in 2022 and 74% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000z3b6nrz5bniw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, childhood vaccine coverage has been declining, and the vast majority of measles cases this year – more than 90% – have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00133b6nxqmvsoct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the news release. “We must act now with determination to overcome barriers like shrinking health budgets, fragile health systems along with misinformation and access constraints because of conflicts. No child should die from a disease we know how to prevent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00143b6nuzdfuchb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Brien said there has been “incredible improvement” in global coverage of the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer and other related diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3j4tje002k3b6nu2a1cb3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of girls receiving a first dose increased to 31% in 2024, from 27% in 2023 and 20% in 2022. The percentage receiving all the doses of vaccine recommended in their country increased to 28% in 2024, from 21% in 2023 and 14% in 2022, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00173b6nnuud6nba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HPV vaccine coverage was somewhat stable among boys, with 8% receiving a first dose in 2024 and 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00193b6nyfwc1jve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a real bright spot in the data that, again, year on year now, we’re seeing increases in HPV vaccine coverage,” O’Brien said, adding that recent increases are largely attributable to the introduction of the vaccine in Nigeria, Bangladesh and four other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001a3b6nuobcr0m0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new report shows that although there hasn’t been a significant retreat in childhood vaccine coverage globally, there hasn’t been significant improvement either, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001b3b6nx7j94c0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fourteen million children who have received no vaccines is 14 million too many. Childhood vaccination is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions that’s ever been developed,” Barouch said. “I would hope that global health authorities prioritize childhood vaccination programs and that funding mechanisms are developed to ensure the continuation of these programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Choosing the right foods to eat before bedtime can help prevent constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Avoid foods high in fat and low in fiber to improve digestion, especially at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Establishing a consistent night routine can help improve bowel regularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re already dealing with constipation, the last thing you need is a nighttime snack that makes things worse. What you eat before bed can have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053282/how-to-digest-food-faster/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;surprising impact on your digestion&lt;/a&gt;, and in some cases, it might be the reason you wake up feeling even more backed up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly 16% of adults in the U.S. suffer from constipation, and that number doubles after the age of 60.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While fiber and hydration are key for keeping things moving, certain foods—especially when eaten right before sleep—can slow digestion even more. We spoke with digestive experts to learn which foods are the worst to eat before bed if you have constipation, plus what to choose instead. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-high-fat-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. High-Fat Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prone to constipation, it’s best to steer clear of high-fat foods before bed—think cheese, processed snacks or heavy takeout,” says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. “These types of meals can slow digestion and may make things worse overnight when your gut naturally slows down.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even large servings of nut butters before bed can be problematic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.goodgutnutritionist.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian specializing in digestive diseases. “Although they are healthy fats, eating too much nut butter before bed can slow down gastric emptying, which means food moves through your digestive system slowly, which can lead to constipation,” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your digestive system follows a circadian rhythm, or 24-hour clock, meaning it’s more active during the day and winds down at night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating foods that are high in fat too close to bedtime can delay stomach emptying and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce the natural morning urge&lt;/a&gt; to go. Instead, choose lighter, high-fiber meals in the evening to support regularity and work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythm—not against it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re used to having a nightcap or a glass of wine before bed, you may want to rethink it if you’re not as regular as you’d like to be. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol acts as a diuretic by lowering levels of vasopressin—a hormone that helps your kidneys hold on to water. When vasopressin is suppressed, your body loses more fluid through frequent urination, which can lead to mild dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dehydration can cause harder, drier stools that are more difficult to pass. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking alcohol can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt your sleep&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-mikhail-yakubov/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mikhail Yakubov, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Manhattan Gastroenterology. “Sleep and digestion are closely linked through your body’s circadian rhythm,” says Yakubov. “Poor sleep quality or insufficient rest can slow gut motility, making it harder to have a morning bowel movement.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-refined-grains"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Refined Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Refined grains&lt;/a&gt; like white bread, white pasta, white rice and desserts may be a comforting nighttime snack, but they can make things worse if you’re feeling backed up. These foods are stripped of most of their fiber during processing, which means they lack the bulk that helps move stool through the digestive tract. “Fiber acts as a broom sweeping through to help keep us regular and remove waste products,” says &lt;a href="http://www.phxvegandietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rhyan Geiger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Highly processed foods that are low in fiber may contribute to slower digestion and movement through the system, causing constipation,” Conlon adds. Instead, opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; like kiwi or dates or high-fiber grains such as oats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-protein-boosted-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Protein-Boosted Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an essential nutrient that everyone needs, but not all proteins are created equal—especially when it comes to digestion. “Many of the high-protein snacks on the market—such as protein bars, cookies, pretzels and chips—contain protein isolates and sugar substitutes that can contribute to uncomfortable bloating and gas in people with sluggish digestion,” says Conlon&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these foods are a convenient way to increase your protein intake, they may cause constipation in some people. Conlon recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-blueberry-peanut-butter-chia-pudding-11713745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; as a high-protein, high-fiber snack to enjoy before bed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-dairy-products"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Dairy Products &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dairy-based snacks like yogurt, milk and cheese might contribute to constipation if you’re sensitive to lactose or have a tendency toward sluggish digestion,” says DeVito. These foods contain protein and fat that take longer to break down in your digestive system. While slower digestion can help keep you feeling full longer for some people, it can be challenging if you already struggle with regular bowel movements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you notice that dairy products tend to leave you feeling backed up, especially in the evening, it’s a good idea to limit how much you consume before bed. Choosing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; or plant-based options can be easier on your digestive system and may help support smoother digestion overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-things-to-do-before-bed-to-help-reduce-constipation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Things to Do Before Bed to Help Reduce Constipation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a light snack rich in fiber and fluids. &lt;/strong&gt;DeVito recommends berries with probiotic-rich kefir or a small bowl of oatmeal with chia seeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a nighttime routine for good sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;“A consistent sleep schedule helps. Your gut thrives on routine just like the rest of your body,” says DeVito. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to help maintain bowel regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gentle movement. &lt;/strong&gt;Conlon recommends some form of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/evening-activity-to-help-you-poop-in-the-morning-11701702" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;light movement after dinner&lt;/a&gt; to encourage digestion, such as walking. Studies show that higher levels of activity are associated with a lower risk of constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals and snacks. &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing of your meals matters when it comes to bowel regularity,” says Conlon. Avoid eating too close to bedtime and aim to spread meals and snacks evenly throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just as there are things that can relieve constipation, there are some things that could be making it worse, particularly things you consume before bed. Much like your sleep, your digestion operates on a circadian rhythm, with things naturally slowing down at nighttime. Eating foods that slow digestion or drinking alcohol before bed can worsen constipation and leave you feeling even more backed up in the morning. Since everyone responds differently, some trial and error may be needed to find which foods are best to avoid before bed.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has revealed promising progress in developing a non-invasive sampling method to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease—up to seven years before motor symptoms appear—by analyzing the chemical makeup of skin.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, published today in &lt;i&gt;npj Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrates that compounds or "volatiles" found in sebum—the oily substance produced by our skin—hold key biomarkers for identifying Parkinson's in its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a technique known as Thermal Desorption-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC-MS), scientists at The University of Manchester, in collaboration with Salford Royal NHS Trust and University of Innsbruck, analyzed skin swabs from participants with Parkinson's, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+volunteers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, and those with a sleep disorder called isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD)—a known early warning sign of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people with iRBD had distinct chemical profiles in their sebum that were different from healthy individuals, but not yet as pronounced as those with established Parkinson's disease. This supports the idea that Parkinson's disease leaves a detectable trace on the body well before physical symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy Milne—the "super smeller" who &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nose-parkinson-diagnosis.html"&gt;inspired the research&lt;/a&gt;—was also able to distinguish swabs from people with iRBD from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson's patients. Intriguingly, she was able to detect both diseases in two of the swabs that came from iRBD individuals, who were later diagnosed with Parkinson's at their next clinical appointment, after sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Professor Perdita Barran, Professor of Mass Spectrometry at The University of Manchester, said, "This is the first study to demonstrate a molecular diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease at the prodromal or early stage. It brings us one step closer to a future where a simple, non-invasive skin swab could help identify people at risk before symptoms arise allowing for earlier intervention and improved outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved more than 80 participants, including 46 people with Parkinson's, 28 healthy controls, and nine with iRBD. They found 55 significant features in the sebum that varied between the groups. Those with iRBD often showed levels that sat between the healthy controls and the Parkinson's group, reinforcing the possibility of detecting the disease in its early phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Drupad Trivedi, a researcher from The University of Manchester, built a model that examined the markers in a longitudinal sampling study. He collected samples from Parkinson's patients over a three-year period and found patterns that suggest this method can also be used to map the progression of the disease, which could have use in refining treatment options and improving patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebum is also easy to collect using gauze swabs from the face or upper back, making it ideal for non-invasive routine screening and regular monitoring. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71598-7" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by the team has also shown it does not need to be stored in the same cold conditions as other biofluids, such as blood, reducing associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The research is inspired by the observations of Joy Milne, who detected a unique scent in individuals with Parkinson's disease, prompting researchers at The University of Manchester to explore sebum as a source of diagnostic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mass+spectrometry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that measures the weight of molecules, they have found that there are distinctive Parkinson's markers in sebum, which has led them to develop this non-invasive swab test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have recently been validated in another paper, published today in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;, where trained dogs were able to detect Parkinson's in the patients recruited by Prof Barren and Dr. Trivedi with remarkable accuracy by smelling skin swabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are continuing to develop and improve the sebum-based testing to eventually use as a practical tool in real-world clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Drupad Trivedi, Lecturer in Analytical Measurement Sciences at The University of Manchester, said, "Our goal is to develop a reliable, non-invasive test that helps doctors detect Parkinson's earlier, track its progression, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're also keen to hear from other hyperosmic individuals, potential 'super smellers' like Joy, whose remarkable sense of smell could help extend our work to detect other diseases with potential odor signatures."&lt;/p&gt;

    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.

            When most of us think about sugar, I bet we’re not thinking about our sex lives. We’re thinking about dessert. I’m writing this with the help of a bowl of vanilla ice cream by my side.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000o356nvmokxbq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sugar makes us feel good in the moment, but over time, too much of it may cause us to lose out on some of life’s most intimate moments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000p356n2n6me7np@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2025, everyone’s been buzzing about GLP-1 injections to help control sugar and lose weight. This new class of medication has helped many achieve meaningful health gains — including improved blood sugar, weight loss — and even improvements to people’s sex lives (because they could be getting better sleep, too).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000q356nhpzffsj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My goal here isn’t to discount the use of GLP-1 drugs or suggest people are taking them unnecessarily (although some people may be). My intent is to spark a broader conversation: What if we also paid more attention to the root cause: our love for sugar and its downstream effects on mood, metabolism, sex and more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000r356n74atmdxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people associate blood sugar with diabetes, but few know what is “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000s356nwuydi1zl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood sugar levels can be checked in real time with a simple finger stick, via home glucose monitor or through wearable devices such as continuous glucose monitors (those coin-size devices you may see on people’s upper arms), which provide feedback on glucose levels throughout the day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What do we see when this test is done? Following is the American Diabetes Association &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;range of reference&lt;/a&gt; for blood glucose levels, but they are not meant for you to diagnose yourself with diabetes. In many instances, your provider may double- or even triple-check these numbers before labeling you with “diabetes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            All numbers should be evaluated by your health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            The point-of-care glucose test gives a snapshot, but there’s one lab that tells the full story — the hemoglobin A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmd3fuy6f001p356nv4x6r7we@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-is-hemoglobin-a1c-and-why-does-it-matter" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What is hemoglobin A1c, and why does it matter?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0012356nd39hm2nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This blood test measures the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your blood that have glucose attached to it — giving you and your health care providers a picture of your average blood sugar over the past two to three months. This makes it a reliable indicator of how well your body manages glucose over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0013356nb0x552wk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; breaks it down:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmd3fvv8f001y356nl9ci8ndq@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Normal: A1c below 5.7%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Prediabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Diabetes: 6.5% or higher
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0017356ncqvjtrp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my work as a surgeon, checking A1c before any procedure — especially those involving implants — is standard practice. Elevated A1c levels are strongly linked to poor recovery, infection risks and surgical complications. So, whether it’s a major urologic procedure or something else, keeping your glucose in check matters more than most people realize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0018356ngpoesmus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sexual health is rarely the first thing people associate with blood sugar, but chronically high glucose levels can have an impact on intimacy — for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0019356nzt4d1wzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In men, high blood sugar can damage the nerves and blood vessels essential for achieving and maintaining erections. Over time, this can present as erectile dysfunction, before a man is ever diagnosed with or thought to be at risk for diabetes. High blood sugar can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/health/low-testosterone-wellness"&gt;lower testosterone&lt;/a&gt; levels, which then reduce libido and energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001a356nyevrg4r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of my patients who do not get routine screenings from their primary care providers come to see me because of changes in sexual performance — only to later discover their blood sugar is out of control. For these patients, their first clue that something was wrong wasn’t thirst, weight changes or fatigue (the more common early signs of diabetes) — it was trouble in the bedroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001b356nmmimv0wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In women, high blood sugar can lead to reduced blood flow and hormone imbalances, which may cause vaginal dryness, painful sex or problems with orgasm. It can also increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections, which can make intimacy painful or less appealing. Many women can feel frustrated and confused about whether these changes are expected from aging, post-menopause, stress or something else. A poor sugar level is usually the last thing on their mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001c356nf5bch2gv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diabetes is incredibly common — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;about 38 million Americans have it&lt;/a&gt; — and nearly 1 in 4 don’t even know it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001d356nqiido2he@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Traditionally, diabetes treatment started with oral medications like metformin, which helps lower glucose by reducing sugar production in the liver. Other classes of pills work in different ways, either by increasing insulin release or helping the kidneys flush out excess sugar. These medications are typically prescribed for people in the earlier stages of diabetes or with mildly elevated A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001e356nvmypf19m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Injectable medications may be necessary when oral pills aren’t enough to treat the disease. For years, that often meant daily insulin injections, which many patients found to be burdensome but necessary. Insulin needs to be carefully timed with meals, and dosing can be tricky. There’s also a real fear of low blood sugar episodes, which can make some people hesitant to start or stick with the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001f356n73a8xxfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few years, GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have become part of many people’s treatment regimens. This class of medication is known by names like semaglutide, liraglutide and tirzepatide. These injections mimic a natural hormone in your body that helps regulate blood sugar, slows down digestion and make you feel fuller faster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001g356nalmlvhjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, they’ve gained worldwide attention for helping people lose weight. In fact, many patients now ask and get these medications before any other option — not just to manage blood sugar, but to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001h356n7cbipkk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These medications also may help normalize testosterone levels in men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090292" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary research&lt;/a&gt; presented at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001i356nn9ip8uhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers tracked 110 men who were prescribed GLP-1 injections but were not taking any testosterone therapy. Over the course of 18 months, as participants lost on average about 10% of their body weight, the number of men with normal testosterone levels increased from 53% to 77%. This rise highlights how medications originally designed for diabetes and weight loss also may improve hormone levels in men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001j356nw944ibgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this abstract has not yet been peer-reviewed and more research is needed, these findings add to a growing body of evidence that managing weight and blood sugar can have ripple effects across nearly every aspect of health — including testosterone, energy and sexual function.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001k356n54t2azfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before turning immediately to medications, don’t underestimate what consistent lifestyle changes can do, not just for your blood sugar but for your whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001l356n1nq6p17l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity, supports weight loss, boosts energy and even enhances sexual function by improving blood flow and hormone balance. A balanced diet — one that’s rich in whole foods, fiber and lean protein — can stabilize blood sugar and reduce inflammation that contributes to chronic disease. Better sleep, reduced alcohol and managing stress all play a role, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001m356n9lvbiwhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, if you’re debating between an injection or a new routine, maybe this time reach for the gym bag before you try anything else. You might just find it changes more than your labs. It might change how you feel about yourself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001n356n0sgoj61k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for me, the next time I help myself to that scoop of ice cream while writing, I’ll remember that it’s not just about my waistline — it’s about my energy, my heart and my sexual health. And now that I’m done with this article, I’ll pick up my gym bag and walk the walk (to the gym) that I’m talking here.
    &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;A team of researchers just discovered compounds that could lead to a new generation of antiviral drugs capable of fighting many viruses at once. Instead of targeting a specific virus, the new molecules work by activating a powerful defense pathway within the host's own cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The technology focuses on a natural cellular defense system called the integrated stress response pathway. Cells normally trigger this pathway to shut down protein production when they detect a viral infection, which stops the virus from replicating. The newly identified compounds act as amplifiers for this response. “If the pathway were turned on in response to viral infection, what our compounds do is they turn it on full blast,” explains Felix Wong, the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;To find these molecules, the team developed a novel screening technique to test nearly 400,000 different chemical compounds. This process yielded several promising candidates. In tests on human cells, these compounds successfully helped the cells fend off infections from RSV, herpes virus, and Zika virus. One of the compounds, IBX-200, also proved effective in mice, where it reduced the viral load and suppress symptoms of a herpes infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;One interesting thing about this approach is that the compounds appear to have no effect on cells that are not already infected, only activating when a virus triggers the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;We are very excited about this work, which allows us to harness the stress response of the host cells to arrive at a means to identify and develop broad-spectrum antivirals. — &lt;strong&gt;James Collins&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the authors on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The team now plans to test the compounds against more viruses in hopes of eventually developing them for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" rel="author" class="nbc_rightbox journalist_bottom"&gt;&lt;div class="j_author"&gt;&lt;a href="Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=369" class="j_name"&gt;Chibuike Okpara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Tech Writer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span title="53 "&gt; - 53 articles published on Notebookcheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; since 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="j_abstract"&gt;I have always been fascinated by technology and digital devices my entire life and even got addicted to it.

I have been writing and publishing articles online for about 6 years now, just about a year ago, I found myself lost in the marvel of smartphones and laptops we have in our hands every day. I developed a passion for learning about new devices and technologies that come with them and at some point, I asked myself, "Why not get into writing tech articles?" It is useless to say I followed up the idea — it is evident. I am an open-minded individual who derives an infinite amount of joy from researching and discovering new information, I believe there is so much to learn and such a short life to live, so I put my time to good use — learning new things.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brown rice packs more fiber and nutrients than white rice, supporting gut health, stable energy, and overall wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White rice digests faster and spikes blood sugar more, but can still fit into a healthy diet when paired with fiber- or protein-rich foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though it has a slightly different taste and texture, brown rice can be an easy, nutritious swap for white rice in many dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rice has been a culinary staple for thousands of years across cultures all over the world, especially in countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea. But this grain’s popularity has since gone global with this grain taking up permanent residence in many pantries across America.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Historically, white rice has been the traditional choice, however, brown rice has become a go-to choice as well, with particular thanks to its reputation for having more health benefits than white rice. But what are the nutritional advantages of brown rice compared to white rice? How do white and brown rice differ from one another, and how do those differences impact our health (if at all)? Is it really “healthier” to swap white rice for brown rice when ordering takeout or deciding what to make for dinner? It’s time to unpack all your burning &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/is-rice-healthy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rice nutrition questions&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How do these rice relatives differ on a physical and nutritional basis? “Physically, white rice contains just one part of the usual rice grain anatomy due to a refining process that removes two key parts of whole rice grain,” explains clinical dietitian Caitlin Carr, MS, RD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains, including whole rice grains (aka brown rice), consist of three structures, or layers—the bran, germ, and endosperm. White rice is made by stripping the bran and germ from brown rice leaving behind its starchy core, the endosperm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice provides a bit more fiber than white rice.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This yields some important nutritional differences between the two rice varieties. In two-thirds of a cup, brown rice contains about two grams of fiber whereas white rice contains only about 0.5 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, “brown rice has more essential minerals like manganese, phosphorus, selenium, and magnesium, along with B-vitamins such as niacin and folate when compared, per cup, to white rice,” Carr says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice offers more plant compounds than white rice.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brown rice is also a good source of plant compounds like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/flavonoids-benefits-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These additional phytonutrients found in brown rice help to support better gut, bone, heart, immune, and metabolic health.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice is digested more slowly and produces lower blood-sugar spikes. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Because of its fiber content, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-carbohydrates-7566945" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brown rice is a complex carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;white rice is a simple carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;. This means that brown rice takes a little longer to digest than white rice,” Carr explains. The increased digestion time of brown rice provides more stable energy levels and also has a positive impact on blood sugars through a more gradual rise and decline in sugar levels. This benefit is particularly significant for those with metabolic concerns like type 2 diabetes, as it can make blood sugar management easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brown rice also contains &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/soluble-fiber-vs-insoluble-fiber" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which is beneficial for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;maintaining bowel regularity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-cholesterol-foods-7567696" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;lowering cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;feeding our gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;,” Carr says. “When the microorganisms in the gut microbiome metabolize soluble fiber, they produce short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed by the gut lining, beginning a cascade of events that are suggested to lower inflammation and oxidative stress throughout the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This benefit is part of the reason why a thriving gut microbiome is linked to better immune, gut, and brain health, among other impressive benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we’ve already started to see, white rice doesn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; measure up nutritionally to brown rice due it’s lower fiber and micronutrient content. White rice’s lower fiber content also equates to a higher score on the glycemic index, a scale to measure how quickly a given food will elevate blood sugars. This index ranks foods on a scale of zero to 100, where the higher the score, the more rapidly a food gets digested in the body, and the more quickly our blood sugars spike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a refined, or simple, carbohydrate, white rice has a &lt;a href="https://glycemic-index.net/white-rice-standard/#:~:text=The%20glycemic%20index%20%28GI%29%20of,as%20a%20high%20GL%20food." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;glycemic index of 70&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://glycemic-index.net/brown-rice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;brown rice measures in at 50&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, very frequent white rice consumption may put us at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, per a 2019 review.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is not to say, however, that white rice can’t be part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-start-eating-healthier-8425807" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced, healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;—especially when it’s eaten accompanied by healthy, high-fiber and high-protein sources. “Brown and white rice are both naturally gluten-free and low-FODMAP foods,” Carr notes, “For individuals with celiac and/or trialing a temporary elimination diet for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), rice [of either variety] may be a good carbohydrate option to include in their meal plans.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The eating experience between these two grains is similar, and they’re typically easy to substitute for one another—however, there are some notable differences. White rice tends to offer a softer texture and more neutral, mild taste. Brown rice, on the other hand, has a chewier texture and nuttier flavor. These differences can take some getting used to if white rice has always been your go-to, but that doesn’t preclude brown rice from being an equally delicious swap-out for white rice in most recipes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White rice is a delicious, traditional, and nostalgic comfort food for many of us, but when you dig into the nutritional details, there’s no denying that brown rice has a leg up in terms of beneficial fiber, micronutrients, and plant compounds. And while white rice enjoyed in moderation can still fit into a healthy, balanced lifestyle, substituting it for brown rice every so often can definitely provide in some wholesome benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I love that both white and brown rice are affordable sources of carbohydrates that can be utilized in so many dishes, made in batches, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-store-rice-7095165" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stored easily&lt;/a&gt;,” Carr says.

      &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to lose a step as we age. Now, scientists want to minimize that decline by studying people with exceptional brains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once we get past about age 40, even a healthy brain begins to lose a step or two. Reaction times get slower. It's harder to remember everything on your shopping list. But scientists are looking for ways to minimize these changes. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Memory lapses and slower thinking can be signs of a disease like Alzheimer's. But Matt Huentelman of the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix says usually they just mean someone's brain is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATT HUENTELMAN: Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman should know. He helps run MindCrowd, a free online cognitive test that's been taken by more than 700,000 people of all ages. Huentelman says about a thousand of those people had test scores indicating their brain was exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: The way that we define an exceptional brain is someone who performs at a level that is about 30 years younger than them when it comes to a memory test or a processing speed test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman says good genes are one factor, but he and a team of researchers are looking for other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation. Another speaker was Dr. Christian Agudelo, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN AGUDELO: I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo's kids are 4 and 6 now. He says his own experience is consistent with his research on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be, both structurally and functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo says the key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the sleep stages. Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brainwave patterns, but Agudelo says people usually know when they've had a good night's rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile. You feel refreshed. And we all, hopefully, have experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky, but Agudelo says you can improve the odds with certain behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun. Being active both socially and physically so we can fall asleep more easily and more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Dr. Charles DeCarli, a neurologist at the University of California, Davis, says brain aging is also affected by vascular risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLES DECARLI: We tend to think about them as affecting the heart, sometimes the blood vessels in the legs or stroke, not so much as it impacts on the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: But DeCarli's research on thousands of people 65 and older found a strong correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than those who do not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The question is, if you have these diseases and they're well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain? And the answer seems to be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Researchers say other ways to keep your brain youthful include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting lots of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After mining the vaccination and medical records of more than 1.2 million children over a 24-year period, researchers could see no evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines led to a statistically significant increase in a child’s risk of developing any of a wide variety of conditions that can be diagnosed in childhood, including asthma and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of the 50 conditions the group looked at — broadly categorized as relating to autoimmune diseases, allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders — occurred at statistically higher levels than would be expected, ruling out moderate or substantially increased risk from exposure to aluminum in vaccines, a finding senior author Anders Hviid described as “quite striking.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can exclude meaningful increases with a large degree of certainty for many of these outcomes,” Hviid, who heads the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark’s public health agency, told STAT in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should not be concerned about aluminum used as an adjuvant in childhood vaccines. I think that’s the core message.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hviid and his co-authors said that while there wasn’t a statistically significant increase seen for any of the conditions they studied, they could not rule out the possibility of a small increased risk for some very rare conditions. “So that tells us that clearly that there’s not an epidemic of chronic diseases in childhood’’ associated with aluminum in vaccines, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The article was published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agreed with Hviid’s take on the findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was very encouraged by the data, particularly for asthma as I know vaccine hesitancy groups are concerned by this,” said Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthew Daley and Jason Glanz, two authors of an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/27/possible-link-aluminum-childhood-vaccines-asthma-risk-caveats/"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested aluminum in childhood vaccines might be tied to an increased risk of developing asthma before age 5, also welcomed the publication. Daley and Glanz, both of whom work at Kaiser Permanente Colorado’s Institute for Health Research, both described the study as well done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the issue of asthma risk in particular, Daley said this new study should provide reassurance to parents that vaccinating their children according to the recommended schedule should not increase their risk of developing asthma. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a practicing pediatrician, I find that reassuring, and my patients and other clinicians I work with should find that reassuring,” said Daley, who noted that even after publishing his study about the possible association between aluminum in vaccines and asthma, he continued to urge parents to vaccinate their children, because he felt the benefits of vaccination were greater than the small possible risk his work identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts are added to some pediatric vaccines to improve the immune response they stimulate. They are used in inactivated vaccines — vaccines made from killed viruses or bacteria — and protein-based vaccines. Vaccines that use live but weakened viruses, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, do not contain aluminum, nor do &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;vaccines made using messenger RNA&lt;/a&gt;, like several of the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have been used for more than 70 years, and there is a large body of evidence supporting their safety and effectiveness. But they have attracted the attention of opponents of vaccines, who argue they may overstimulate immune systems. The amount of aluminum that children are exposed to through vaccines is well below accepted safe limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley and his co-authors undertook their study after a 2013 report on vaccine safety from the Institute of Medicine — which has since been renamed the National Academy of Medicine — urged additional research of whether there might be a link between exposure to aluminum in vaccines and the development of asthma. After their &lt;a href="https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/acap/Aluminium_Exposure_Article-1664288052690.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;results were published in the journal Academic Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, Hviid and his colleagues in Denmark were inspired to take another look. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel a sense of gratitude that they undertook this study,” Daley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating the safety of aluminum in vaccines is challenging because aluminum is ubiquitous — it’s the third-most abundant element on the planet, Glanz said. Humans encounter it daily, in food, for instance. It is even found in breast milk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hviid and colleagues from the Statens Serum Institut and from the University of Copenhagen used Denmark’s nationwide health care registries to compile a cohort of 1.2 million children born between 1997 and 2018, checking for diagnoses for 50 conditions. They examined the records of the children out to 5 years of age.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the number of vaccines given in early childhood changed over the 24-year study period, the researchers were able to determine whether rates of any of these conditions changed as the amount of aluminum children received via vaccinations increased when new vaccines were added to the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That they didn’t see differences among children who received more vaccines in early childhood is a strength of the study, Daley said. That’s because if something causes a biological effect, receiving more of the substance should exacerbate the effect. It’s a phenomenon referred to as a dose response.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“They don’t see any dose response there at all. And their study was set up to see a dose response if one was there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley noted a few caveats in interpreting the results, pointing out that the vaccine schedule in Denmark is slightly different from the one used in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They immunize at 3 months, 5 months, 12 months. We immunize at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months. I would be surprised that that slight difference between 2 and 3 months would make a big difference. But it is important to acknowledge that there is a difference we should keep in mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, this isn’t a randomized controlled trial; researchers were not comparing children who received no aluminum-containing vaccines to children who did get shots containing aluminum. Such a study would not be ethical to conduct because withholding vaccines from some children would put them at risk of serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the size of this study and the clear-cut nature of the results underscores the safety of these critical vaccines, Hviid said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are really important for our immunization programs. Not just in Denmark, not just in the U.S., but globally,” he said. “We don’t have any replacements for these vaccines with other adjuvants. So if you take them away, children are going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists identified a subset of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that integrate oxytocin, ovarian hormones, and social cues to modulate sexual receptivity in females and suppress mating interest in males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating these neurons made non-fertile females receptive, while silencing them during estrus stopped their interest, with opposite effects in males. The findings show how identical brain circuits can produce dramatically different behaviors in males and females depending on hormonal states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Responsive Circuit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cacna1h+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex control sociosexual behaviors by integrating oxytocin and ovarian hormone signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating the circuit boosts mating interest in females but suppresses it in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; The neurons both drive and are activated by mating-related social interactions, showing a feedback loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In animals with social structures, the drive to reproduce is a complex process; governed by the brain, it’s influenced by both internal cues such as hormones and external factors such as interactions with potential mates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area long known to play a critical role is the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Located just behind the forehead, this node governs various aspects of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Cell, &lt;/em&gt;researchers at Rockefeller University’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology, led by Nathaniel Heintz, have determined how a subregion of the PFC influences the reproductive drive in mice: through a hormonally primed cortical circuit that controls how and when female mice seek to mate with males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit, which connects to multiple layers of the brain, is stimulated by both the “love hormone” oxytocin and ovarian hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The circuit integrates hormonal states with the recognition of potential mates to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors,” says Ines Ibañez-Tallon, research associate professor in the lab and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, male mice also have this circuit, but its activation has the opposite effect in them: they become less interested in mating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shared circuitry is flexibly sculpted by both hormonal state and biological sex to produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior,” says senior co-author Kun Li, a former Ph.D. student in the lab and now an associate professor in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could help explain why sexual motivation and social interest fluctuate across reproductive states and differ between sexes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual dimorphism in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds upon earlier findings from the lab. In 2014, the researchers discovered a new type of brain cell in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that they dubbed oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons (OxtrINs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is a hormone linked to bonding of all kinds—maternal, familial, romantic, social. In mice, the team found, the OxtrINs cortical circuit promoted receptivity to mating—but only in females, and only during estrus, or the fertile period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by the idea that a cell type identical in male and female mice could affect them very differently, the researchers, led by Heintz and Ibañez-Tallon, conducted additional studies that further documented OxtrIN’s uneven influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 study, they found that the activation of OxtrINs reduce anxiety-related behavior in male mice but not in female mice. While it did not alter anxiety levels in female mice, it did, however, cause the females to show more social preference for male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both discoveries pointed to a critical role for the mPFC in adaptive social behaviors dependent on reproductive states, “how the mPFC senses internal hormonal states and regulates flexible control over social behavioral outputs remained unclear,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, some of which was conducted at Tsinghua University, the researchers aimed to dive into those details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous research had located oxytocin-sensitive neurons in multiple layers of the mPFC. For the current study, Li and colleagues homed in on layer 5, which sends information to other areas of the brain. They identified neurons in this layer that expressed the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; gene, which produces calcium channels—electrical switches that neurons use to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then traced its connections into the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) region of the hypothalamus, an ancient, hormonally driven part of the brain that regulates basic needs such as hunger, thirst, and sleep, as well as sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used a variety of advanced techniques to monitor neural activity in the female mice’s brains as they went through a full estrus cycle—the equivalent of a human menstrual cycle—and interacted with male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cacna1h+ neurons turned out to be highly responsive to ovarian hormones, lighting up when the mice were fertile. During this period, the female mice sought out the male mice more, rejected them less, and showed heightened sexual receptivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the team determined that Cacna1h+ neurons are a hormonally influenced critical subset of neurons that respond to prompts from oxytocin via OxtrINs, receiving social cues, and the AHN, which reads internal signals, resulting in sociosexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, manipulating the neurons changed that behavior in diametrically opposed ways in the mice. When Li turned on the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; neurons in female mice during the nonfertile period, the mice began to act as if they were hormonally prepped to mate. And when she inhibited the neurons during estrus, the mice lost all interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposite was true for the male mice, whose brain activity was also monitored. Silencing the Cacna1h+ neurons in male mice spiked their interest in female mice, and they were quicker to try to mate with them. And activating the neurons suppressed male sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit seems to have a feedback loop as well. That is, not only can Cacna1h+ neural activity initiate behavior, but behavior can activate the neurons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In estrus females, these neurons were strongly activated by male cues and promoted sociosexual interest and sexual receptivity, while in males these neurons did not respond to female cues, and the male mice showed reduced interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating,” Ibañez-Tallon says. “Even when the neural circuitry, neuronal populations, and molecular components are identical—differing only in their levels of expression—the system can produce remarkably distinct functional outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ovarian hormones, in the future they’ll look into the influence of testosterone, which has well-established links to depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the strikingly different functional roles of Cacna1h+ neurons in males, it’s likely that testosterone plays a key role in their development or responsiveness,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This line of research could provide valuable insights into the sex-specific regulation and vulnerability of social and emotional behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c070a0902162c1e030f07090a090000091e42090819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Fenz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rockefeller.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Fenz – Rockefeller University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathaniel Heintz et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female sociosexual behaviors, essential for survival and reproduction, are modulated by ovarian hormones and triggered in the context of appropriate social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify primary estrous-sensitive Cacna1h-expressing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons that integrate hormonal states with recognition of potential mates to orchestrate these complex cognitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional manipulation of mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons shifts opposite-sex-directed social behaviors between estrus and diestrus females via anterior hypothalamic outputs.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;July 14 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/public-health/covid-2665435130.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/" target="_blank" title="COVID-19" class="tpstyle"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; cases are on the rise again across the United States, with the biggest increases in parts of the South, Southeast and West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 25 states are seeing growth in COVID-19 cases as a summer wave appears to be starting, CBS News reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though activity remains "low" nationwide - based on CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html#national-region-trends" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; - it's up from "very low" the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest increases in emergency room visits for COVID-19 have happened in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In those areas, rates are now the highest they've been since February and March, CBS News added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts had been watching for a possible summer spike, as new versions of the virus spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CDC &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/25-0451_article" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows that COVID-19 now seems to follow a twice-a-year pattern: Cases usually peak once in the summer (July through September) and again in the winter (from December through February).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues," CDC scientists wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S1 diversity refers to ongoing changes in a key part of the virus's spike protein - specifically the S1 region, which helps the virus bind to human cells, CBS News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC is also warning about another virus that's spreading more than usual right now: Parvovirus B19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who catch this virus don't get very sick. But some develop &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/pulmonology/influenza-2665039558.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are at higher risk for complications from parvovirus B19. The CDC says they should take extra steps to protect themselves such as wearing a mask in high-risk places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, health officials said emergency rooms are seeing a spike in patients with this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Several of the most recent weeks saw the highest percentage of B19-associated ED visits compared to the same week in all years since 2015," health officials &lt;a href="https://www.chicagohan.org/alert-detail/-/alert-details/46690380?p_r_p_categoryId=undefined" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus B19 is not the same parvovirus that infects dogs and other canines.&lt;/p&gt;

Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd7f86" class="body-graf"&gt;In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man’s skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63eeeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I’ve been on in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43fff1" class="body-graf"&gt;Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0739e" class="body-graf"&gt;But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It’s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df5ab3" class="body-graf"&gt;The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation’s retirement-age population grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25f858" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d90396" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47ad75" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-649d55" class="body-heading"&gt;Choking is a danger to older adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-466e98" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd91b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9949c" class="body-graf"&gt;Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-83cf04" class="body-heading"&gt;The best ways to stop choking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-369267" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e1e6b" class="body-graf"&gt;When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c8673" class="body-graf"&gt;There’s also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-abc19d" class="body-graf"&gt;The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3f02a" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b9729" class="body-graf"&gt;It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1cb4e1" class="body-graf"&gt;Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that’s where their products can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-383a30" class="body-graf"&gt;“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ce55cd" class="body-heading"&gt;Antichoking devices aren’t always risk-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a0873a" class="body-graf"&gt;They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e1b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06d017" class="body-graf"&gt;Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4c733" class="body-graf"&gt;An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dechoker-llc-614629-05102021"&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dechoker in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073376" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that’s not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-encourages-public-follow-established-choking-rescue-protocols-fda-safety-communication"&gt;notice to consumers&lt;/a&gt; that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c730f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b79c29" class="body-heading"&gt;More research is needed, choking expert says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0001" class="body-graf"&gt;Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41d241" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47c615" class="body-graf"&gt;One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17b5a5" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it’s tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a6290" class="body-graf"&gt;The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b70364" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e6c97" class="body-graf"&gt;Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(24)00151-5/fulltext"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35a18e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 19:13:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQX0RUWGlIWjljaUFZdHY5alhTN2F0T2dNZ1BMalRVV29HdDFDbHY0TXJqTjFNenp5M0Vmc09QRUk1YUlnXzE1STlFbks2V0hYSWZ6SnBQRjNUZnRxQzA0T3A0NUtoa2p0Mm5rWm1CZW4zVl9tdGNxMlJzdTRNMC1jSE10TVN3bmlJZTdjSUItdDYwZjJrU3dfdDFEa1BFNGVPbi1Cc1NxeFQweXF30gFWQVVfeXFMTjJ1S1FWekJFZVZ6ellKVVJhX3RmdzdPd0dyUkhMZ3pwR2VqLU5kNE1KcmVyd1Utcm5UQ1gzU0xVM0VNQmtrd3BXck5WSlF5WE42QUJzdkE</guid></item><item><title>需要睾酮增强吗？也许尝试一些Ozempic - Gizmodo | Need a Testosterone Boost?

              &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that Ozempic and drugs like it &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do? A study out today finds that GLP-1 medications often raise men’s testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in St. Louis, Missouri, led the research, which studied men taking one of several GLP-1 drugs for their type 2 diabetes or obesity. On average, men’s testosterone rose significantly after they started taking a GLP-1, with many reaching normal levels. The findings suggest these weight loss drugs can also have reproductive health benefits for men, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testosterone is important to both men’s and women’s health, but it’s especially vital to the former. In men, it helps maintain muscle mass, bone density, and fertility, to name a few functions. People who develop type 2 diabetes or obesity often experience declining T levels. Conversely, people who lose weight or get their blood sugar under control tend to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf137/8058933"&gt;regain&lt;/a&gt; this lost testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, however, there isn’t much research looking into what happens to men and their testosterone once they start taking GLP-1s like semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity drug Wegovy). And they wanted to better understand the broader health benefits of these medications beyond weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed over 200 men with type 2 diabetes or obesity who were prescribed a GLP-1 (semaglutide, tirzepatide, or the older GLP-1 dulaglutide) and who were not taking added testosterone or other hormones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men’s blood sugar control and weight improved, as expected, with an average weight loss of 10%—and so did their testosterone. Men’s average total and free testosterone levels rose noticeably from their baseline. Only 53% of men had normal T levels before GLP-1 treatments; afterward, the same was true for 77% of men. The team’s findings were presented Monday at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T-boosting effects of GLP-1 therapy didn’t seem quite as large as those seen with other weight loss treatments, particularly surgery. These drugs offer their own advantages, though, according to lead study researcher Shellsea Portillo Canales.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s less dramatic than the rise seen after bariatric surgery, which typically causes rapid and substantial hormonal shifts,” Portillo Canales, an endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, told Gizmodo. “However, the benefit of GLP-1s is that they are non-invasive, more accessible, and can help improve testosterone naturally, especially when combined with sustained weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improvement in men’s testosterone levels correlated well with how many pounds they shed, suggesting that weight loss is the primary driver of this effect. But Portillo Canales doesn’t rule out that other factors, like improved insulin resistance and lower inflammation, could matter, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to further confirm this link through prospective studies that proactively track men and their testosterone levels once on GLP-1 therapy. But given that these patients are already taking these drugs for their diabetes or obesity, the potential boost in testosterone could be seen as a nifty bonus at the very least. Just be careful, though. Portillo Canales notes that if men stop taking a GLP-1 and start to gain back weight, their testosterone levels might sink back down along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study found that erythritol exposure reduced nitric oxide, increased vessel constrictors, impaired clot-busting abilities, and boosted free radical production in these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes create a higher risk environment for clotting and reduced blood flow to the brain. Researchers caution that while the study was conducted in cells, it adds to growing evidence of erythritol’s potential health harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erythritol exposure made brain blood vessel cells more constricted and prone to clotting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free radical production increased, while protective clot-busting compounds decreased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even typical serving sizes of erythritol could have measurable cellular effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From low-carb ice cream to keto protein bars to “sugar-free” soda, the decades-old sweetener erythritol is everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new University of Colorado Boulder research shows the popular sugar substitute and specialty food additive comes with serious downsides, impacting brain cells in numerous ways that can boost risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111614"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a packet of sweetener." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said senior author Christopher DeSouza, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Integrative Vascular Biology Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, often produced by fermenting corn and found in hundreds of products. It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers in the lab treated human cells that line blood vessels in the brain for three hours with about the same amount of erythritol contained in a typical sugar-free beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that the treated cells were altered in numerous ways: They expressed significantly less nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels, and more endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, when challenged with a clot-forming compound called thrombin, cellular production of the natural clot-busting compound t-PA was “markedly blunted.” The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. “free radicals,” metabolic byproducts which can age and damage cells and inflame tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute.  For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors caution that their study was a laboratory study, conducted on cells, and larger studies in people are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or “sugar alcohol” on the label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdd1d4cedc93d0dccfced5dcd1d1fdded2d1d2cfdcd9d293d8d9c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Marshall – University of Colorado&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/a&gt;” by Auburn Berry et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental aim of this study was to determine, in vitro, the effect of the non-nutritive sweetener erythritol on brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET)-1 production, as well as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) were cultured and treated with 6 mM erythritol, equivalent to a typical amount of erythritol (30 g) in an artificially sweetened beverage, for 3 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was significantly higher in hCMECs treated with erythritol (204 ± 32% vs. 105 ± 4%) as well as the expression of antioxidant proteins, superoxide dismutase-1 [332.1 ± 16.2 vs. 214.9 ± 4.7 arbitrary units (AU); &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002] and catalase (30.9 ± 0.3 vs. 24.4 ± 0.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was not significantly altered (102.8 ± 21.4 vs. 99.0 ± 19.9 AU); the expression of p-eNOS (Ser1177) was lower (52.1 ± 2.1 vs. 77.3 ± 9.1 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and p-eNOS (Thr495) was higher (63.4 ± 8.0 vs. 45.6 ± 6.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) in hCMECs treated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell expression of Big ET-1 was also higher in erythritol-treated cells (56.4 ± 9.8 vs. 40.9 ± 6.5 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Consequently, the endothelial NO production was significantly lower (5.8 ± 0.8 vs. 7.3 ± 0.7 µmol/L) and ET-1 production was significantly higher (34.6 ± 2.3 vs. 26.9 ± 1.5 pg/mL) in response to erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;t-PA release in response to thrombin was significantly blunted in erythritol-treated (from 87.4 ± 6.3 to 87.6 ± 8.3 pg/mL) versus untreated (90.1 ± 5.5 to 110.2 ± 6.4 pg/mL) hCMECs. In summary, erythritol adversely affects oxidative stress, NO production, ET-1 production, and t-PA release in brain microvascular endothelial cells, potentially contributing to the increased risk of ischemic stroke associated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW &amp;amp; NOTEWORTHY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol, a common non-nutritive sweetener, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides novel data, demonstrating that erythritol (at a concentration typically contained in a standard-size commercially available artificially sweetened beverage) adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, eNOS activation and NO production, ET-1 expression, and t-PA release in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:59:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1sOWlqRmJGYURQcElpNDB3YVZXV0tjbl94VjJHMVJiZGFPT0xjU1NkSWlLaFp6M082MWhFQW1NLXN1VEg4U3JLWFIzQk0wZmVkUGdjdGJ1RU1aTlZsRFVEM1RnQzkzb295SmMwSTRQR2U</guid></item><item><title>缅因州科学家研究眼科检查是否可以早期发现阿尔茨海默氏症-《波特兰先驱报》 | Maine scientists researching whether eye test could lead to early detection of Alzheimer’s - The Portland Press Herald</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxOSHBxQmRVMGE0RXhXYkxZUlM3cWIybnNmZ1hSalVadkVUWm0tTnBPWmxvZFFxTF84NmhIRlhPUXJ1TUxORnlSR0JsWW5ORTlvNGlNcDR2NFFrY3lueDBPNzZ4cnM0MUp1R2lvOEpiR1JiZmZtSjhKZ0xfREtyX1AwaWlmeVJSZlRTNFZyLWszMnc2MFBkQzRmNk96Vm1pTkdMY2FQaWIxVGZvVk5vTEZyMkdWX0kxVS1MX3ZwaFBuM3hFVHJkYlA2dg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Portland Press Herald</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:33:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxOSHBxQmRVMGE0RXhXYkxZUlM3cWIybnNmZ1hSalVadkVUWm0tTnBPWmxvZFFxTF84NmhIRlhPUXJ1TUxORnlSR0JsWW5ORTlvNGlNcDR2NFFrY3lueDBPNzZ4cnM0MUp1R2lvOEpiR1JiZmZtSjhKZ0xfREtyX1AwaWlmeVJSZlRTNFZyLWszMnc2MFBkQzRmNk96Vm1pTkdMY2FQaWIxVGZvVk5vTEZyMkdWX0kxVS1MX3ZwaFBuM3hFVHJkYlA2dg</guid></item><item><title>2025年到目前为止，佛罗里达州有4人死于食肉细菌- ABC7 WWSB | Flesh eating bacteria kills 4 people in Florida so far in 2025 - ABC7 WWSB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNdXlRaEpNRzdIaUZsR1BoVXE4MDJSZ21RMC1HU3VnSmdtVWRkbnRJY1pnS2p6X2hjbEtWTGN1THZ4bHBJY3E5bmxRdkxqRHFzZTlxQWZobmJSQ08zcmJkRG9Hdk1QWTRNMkcyZzlwOVJqemhMZkpPWWtTaExpZHFCNTRoLUsxYkdpUW1HSjNZUjA5N2w0eDctWnNIa9IBrwFBVV95cUxNZFowVDNvRTVSM1M4d0ZjQzdYVVBZT3AtZlNnaVdjSk42YmN6ejBZVjZNdVJwakQtZG0yWmdnMHlFUWlEajF1a2cyeUh0X1pYQ0tiNEtWU1hFVTg4UDJIejNZU3lzaEpxdHpkT0I1WTVkVDFuUkt0cmhVYTMzYUxuM3RKaHpkS2ZHbG9ZN3ljbUNsdFNuc1VGb2N4eHlZME5vT0hQMjBIaTNuOXhlVS1r?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;SARASOTA, Fla.

designed for convenience, shelf life, and hyper-palatability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of packaged snacks, sugary cereals, soda, instant noodles, and frozen meals – these aren’t just “processed,” they’re engineered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers strip raw ingredients of their natural nutrients, then add fats, sugars, artificial flavors, emulsifiers, preservatives, and colorings to craft something addictive and uniform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is food that barely resembles its original form and is often high in calories but low in real nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, UPFs are everywhere – and they’re linked to a rising tide of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-make-our-bodies-age-faster/"&gt;chronic health issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ultra-processed-foods-raise-alarms"&gt;Ultra‑processed foods raise alarms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies classify foods by how much industry tampering they undergo, a system formalized in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38418082/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOVA classification&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian sample, daily intake averaged just over three servings of these items, but the top quarter of participants swallowed nearly six, crowding out fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark metabolic‑ward trial showed that volunteers offered ultra‑processed food menus ate about 500 extra calories per day compared with identical nutrient profiles made from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tool-lets-you-check-how-processed-your-food-is-grocerydb/"&gt;unprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in that study gained nearly two pounds in just two weeks, underscoring the silent calorie creep of factory‑formulated meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inflammation-is-the-hidden-spark"&gt;Inflammation is the hidden spark&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the strongest signals in the McMaster dataset was a rise in &lt;a href="https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/high-sensitivity-c-reactive-protein-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease-measure-or-not?language_content_entity=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C‑reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, a liver‑made marker that flags systemic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of this protein are now listed as a heart‑disease risk enhancer, so its appearance in heavy snackers hints at trouble brewing beneath the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These foods are causing an inflammatory response, in a sense our bodies see them as some kind of other element,” Christoforou explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-bathroom-scale"&gt;Beyond the bathroom scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics sometimes argue that the harms of packaged foods stem solely from the extra pounds they add, yet the study adjusted for body mass index and still saw higher insulin and triglycerides in high‑UPF eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective U.S. cohorts reached a similar conclusion, linking high UPF diets to a 24 percent jump in type 2 diabetes risk even after accounting for weight changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/hall-kevin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kevin Hall&lt;/a&gt;’s metabolic‑ward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105044/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; supports that idea, showing that people chewed faster, finished meals sooner, and felt less full when the dishes were ultra‑processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-socioeconomic-angles-and-policy-gaps"&gt;Socioeconomic angles and policy gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the McMaster survey, heavy UPF eaters were more likely to have lower incomes and less formal education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health risks persist independently of income and education, highlighting the need for broad, equitable food policies,” warned Angelina Baric, a graduate student co‑author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38719536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; covering 45 million person‑years estimated that cutting UPF intake could avert thousands of premature deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marketing-that-targets-children"&gt;Marketing that targets children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods aren’t just convenient, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultraprocessed-foods-pose-major-health-risks-especially-for-kids/"&gt;aggressively marketed&lt;/a&gt;. From children’s cartoons on cereal boxes to bold health claims on energy bars, these strategies are designed to shape preferences early and build loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2653912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that marketing exposure significantly influences eating habits, especially among youth and low-income populations who may have fewer healthy options available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these products carry front-of-package labels that promote added fiber, vitamins, or protein, giving a false impression of health. These claims often distract from the overall quality of the food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364956/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that nutrient-focused labels can mislead consumers into thinking a product is healthier than it actually is, even when it’s high in added sugar or sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-matrix-and-biological-effects"&gt;Food matrix and biological effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;overlooked aspects&lt;/a&gt; of ultra-processed foods is how they alter the food matrix, the physical and chemical structure of what we eat, which affects how it’s digested and absorbed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By breaking down fiber, emulsifying fats, and adding sugars, UPFs speed up digestion, increase glycemic load, and can bypass natural satiety signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s growing concern that these structural changes may harm the gut microbiome, the community of microbes that helps regulate immunity and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests certain emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners commonly used in UPFs can disrupt gut bacteria and may lead to inflammatory responses, insulin resistance, and other metabolic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;Future of ultra‑processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialing back UPF does not require an all‑or‑nothing pledge; replacing even one daily serving with whole fruit or unsalted nuts trimmed inflammatory markers in trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians recommend starting with breakfast, swapping sugared cereal for oatmeal, then moving on to snacks, habits that nudge down average servings without demanding perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/food-additives.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; is already reviewing additives and marketing rules, and the new biomarker evidence gives those deliberations fresh urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-025-00935-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:05:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMEtoTERzb3NfaWFsb1YyY194VzBWZGhuWElYdnpFdDhYTENCZFM1ZW5ZVkZYVEljXy0wQWo5MGx6bVppUUM4a1VDcHRzSGs1NFlhR0QxcXhvZjNDQUdfOWNoR2xiNUJ3Q2lYSkl4aVlhM2ROLU9pNmhiYlZ5cy0yTjllZ0NoS29YYy05YjBWQk8zcFVLamJETUZmUV82cG4tMGtCZXY4R1JySGc</guid></item><item><title>“我感觉很虚弱” ： NC女性在32岁时诊断出子宫内膜癌后敦促提高认识- WRAL.com | 'I felt so weak': NC woman urges awareness after endometrial cancer diagnosis at 32 - WRAL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNWElmS3ZNMU5wRUVaemZWSW8zZDRDZ0pPNWVtWG5hQlhlVXRDMURQN0NWaWFnNlFwMkg2WmxsaDQtU2F3cXRyMHNvT2ZoWTB3QzYzRWFOcEN6azNVYXRDODlJa1E1a0ItN05fdEk0eGtjOEZYZ0RkbGpXYkRwMWlGTFNfRFhRWHZESlpkVHRkTTV6OVRZcDdBNTZpNEZqUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;At 32, Wendy Maultsby was working full-time and planning out
her dream future: meeting her future husband, getting married, and giving birth
to her first child.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But what awaited Maultsby was a diagnosis she never anticipated—and
certainly not in her 30s. If she ever imagined it, she thought it would come
when she was a grandmother in her 70s. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Around February 2022, I started what I thought was a
regular menstrual cycle,” the now 35-year-old recalled. “Everything seemed
normal, but things seemed strange when it started getting heavier than usual.
It lasted for about two-and-a-half months.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby shared her symptoms were relentless and resulted in
multiple trips to urgent care. She was given medication that would offer temporary
relief, but the bleeding continued. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It got to the point where one day I just felt so weak. I
was in my office at work and I was so weak I couldn’t even walk to my car,” she
said. “I knew something was wrong. My heart was beating incredibly fast. I got
home, I went straight to bed, and I thought, ‘I’ll just sleep it off. Maybe I’m
just tired or stressed.’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When she didn’t feel better the next morning, Maultsby said
her gut told her she needed to go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I got to the ER, and they put me back into the room almost
immediately. It turned out I had lost so much blood that I required a blood
transfusion,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Her extreme blood loss was putting additional stress on her
heart and causing it to pump harder than usual to circulate what little blood
she had left. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An emergency gynecological visit to Johnston Memorial
Hospital in Smithfield caused the Johnston County resident to be scheduled for
a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL, “The doctor was like, ‘It’s super highly
unlikely this is it, but I just want to cross all of my Ts.’ I almost canceled that
appointment because the schedule of birth control that she had given me did
stop the bleeding. I was like ‘Oh, I’m fine. I’m cured.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby still remembers the Friday morning, just a few days
after her biopsy, when she got the call that changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I’m so sorry, but you do have cancer.’ I was in
complete shock,” she said. “The first thing I thought about was, ‘Am I going to
die?’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis for endometrial cancer is 60,
according to the American Cancer Society, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/endometrial-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;with diagnoses under 45 being uncommon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said she was told her prognosis was good and she
would likely live a long life because the cancer was caught early. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But her dream of getting pregnant was suddenly in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“My biggest fear was that my fertility would be affected,”
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby continued, “My options were basically to have a hysterectomy,
or have hormone treatment. I opted to do hormone treatment so that I would have
the possibility of motherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Maultsby is celebrating five months of
marriage. She shared she and her husband are continuing to weigh all their
options of becoming parents. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’re still going to try to become parents the natural way,
but if that doesn’t work out then we plan to adopt,” said Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angeles Alvarez Secord with the Duke Cancer Center is one
of the physicians who has been treating Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The gynecologic oncologist shared cases like Maultsby’s are
becoming more common as the cancer affects a greater number of young adults. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL investigated the rise in younger cancer cases in our
recent documentary &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/diagnosis-young-the-new-face-of-cancer-in-nc/22052931/"&gt;Diagnosis:
Young, The New Face of Cancer in NC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This disease
continues to rise in the United States,” shared Alvarez
Secord. “It's anticipated that about 70,000 women will have a diagnosis of
uterine cancer this year, and almost 14,000 women will die.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician stated education is vital to reducing the grim
statistic, particularly among at-risk demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who identify as Black are at a twofold
increased risk of death,” she added. “We’re seeing an aggressive rise in
cancers in women under the age of 50. These issues in totality, they cannot be
ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said abnormal bleeding is the most common symptom
patients will present with, regardless of age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If somebody is postmenopausal and they’ve stopped having
their periods and have any bleeding at all, even just a red dab, that is a huge
warning sign,” the doctor advised. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “If it’s before menopause, it can be
harder. What you’re looking for is, is there an increase in that bleeding
pattern or are they having bleeding between their periods, or any sort of abnormal
bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She noted that bleeding after sexual intercourse is
another sign someone should seek medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said in addition to a biopsy, a patient may
have a pelvic ultrasound to help reach a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician noted clinicians also need to be more aware
of the growing impact cancer is having on younger demographics to prevent
symptoms from being misdiagnosed or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Often they will think it’s their period, and it’s not
just them that think that, it could be their healthcare providers as well,”
said Alvarez Secord. “For the care providers that are on the front lines, it’s having
that little ‘red flag’ in the back of your head that somebody complains their
cycles are increasing, or becoming abnormal, or bleeding between periods or
after sex—that needs to trigger some sort of evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby added more open conversations among those with
diagnoses like herself could help reduce stigma, and aid in earlier
intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was almost embarrassing to talk about at first,”
Maultsby added. “I wanted nobody to know because I felt like I had an elderly
person’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL she often questioned, “What did I do
wrong?” after being diagnosed at such a young age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Knowing it is an epidemic, makes me want to share my story
because I know a lot more people are going to be diagnosed in the coming years,”
she said. “They need to know they’re not alone, and it’s not your fault. This
is something that is ongoing and it is happening. Research has come so far, but
we need more of it, and we just need to advocate for each other and ourselves
in this fight against cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord further underscored the call for more
research, adding, “We need to do something. It's a serious call for action.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The oncologist noted recent NIH cuts impacting medical
research nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/unc-chapel-hill-126m-federal-grant-cuts-june-2025/"&gt;including
cancer research in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, is cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is very hard for OBGYNs to
compete at that level,” Alvarez Secord said. “I think probably in terms of NH
dollars, OBGYNs represent about 1% of that. When you cut funding even further,
I'm worried that we're going to lose a generation of researchers who are going
to have a calling to do this work specifically for cancers that affect women.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked what she thought might contribute to the rise in
young cancer diagnoses, Alvarez Secord called attention to the food supply.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think there's a lot of
potential linkages between food, not just highly processed, but different types
of food that we eat. We've gone from an environment where you used to eat food that
came out of your own garden, to an environment where now everything's bought at
the grocery store. And, a lot of people don't even eat raw vegetables and
fruits,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said one of her biggest
pieces of advice for other young adults is to prioritize their health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“People need to empower themselves,
especially with learning their own family history and their own personal risk,”
she said. “Remember your health is so precious. Being so young, it is easy to
take health for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “When I was younger,
I wish I had limited alcohol more. I wish I had been more physically active, and
consumed less processed foods, and slept better. I definitely didn’t take as
great care of myself as I do today. It’s only because once you lose your health
it becomes the most precious thing to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;SULLIVAN, N.Y. -- Mosquitoes collected from a trap in the Town of Sullivan have tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's according to Madison County Public Health, which received notification from the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Laboratory regarding the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No human cases of JCV have been reported in the County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JCV can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the health department, "JCV does not spread from person to person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people infected with JCV do not have symptoms. For people who get sick, symptoms may occur in a few days to 2 weeks. Symptoms may start with a fever, fatigue, and headache. Respiratory symptoms may develop and include a sore throat, runny nose and cough. In rare cases, JCV may cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (meningitis). Symptoms of encephalitis or meningitis include stiff neck, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking or seizures. Some people who develop severe disease may need to be hospitalized. Most recover from the virus," according to the local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection of this virus in Madison County serves as a reminder of the presence of mosquito-borne diseases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.madisoncounty.ny.gov/2985/Mosquitos-and-Disease" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about mosquitoes from Madison County Public Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The LE8 includes eight specific health behaviors and factors to help determine a person’s heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be more active&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get healthy sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quit tobacco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eight components identified by the American Heart Association as being linked to cardiovascular disease risk are already well established,” El Khoudary explained. “What remains unclear, however, is how well women in midlife are doing in relation to these components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6784846/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous work;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the menopause transition is really a critical turning point, a time when women experience changes in many components of Life’s Essential 8,” she continued. “So, women really need to work to counteract all of those changes in midlife to protect their cardiovascular health in the ensuing years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Only 1 in 5 menopausal women have ideal heart health scores&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, El Khoudary and her team found that four LE8 components — managing blood sugar and blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use — were the main factors driving study participants’ future heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is important because it highlights key areas … that may have the greatest impact on future heart health for women,” El Khoudary explained. “However, our study did not test whether targeting these specifically leads to better outcomes than focusing on other factors. This is an important question for future clinical trials to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that only one in five menopausal women have an ideal LE8 score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we compare this to the general population, the prevalence is very close,” El Khoudary said. “There’s very low prevalence of optimal LE8 scores. Unfortunately, many people still need to do more, including women who are in this vulnerable stage, the menopause transition. Of course, that’s easier said than done! There are many barriers to living up to Life’s Essential 8. And there is also a lack of awareness. We need to continue to work to address both of those challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next, we need to understand why many midlife women struggle to maintain ideal heart health and what barriers they face. Research should focus on testing interventions targeting glucose, blood pressure, nicotine use, and sleep to reduce long-term risk. Improving sleep quality also deserves more attention. Ultimately, finding effective ways to help women adopt and stick to healthy habits is key.”&lt;br&gt;— Samar R.

A doctor who researches the link between the disease and our gut microbes has a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to give the message that microbes are the entire thing. But we know that there are significant correlations between how much we have of various microbes and cancer," Dr. Neelendu Dey, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trillions of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;microbes live in our colon lining&lt;/a&gt;, and research suggests the more diverse they are the better our health and the lower our chances of developing diseases including colon and other forms of cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we eat and our environment affect the make-up of what's known as the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, ultra-processed foods and being sedentary are thought to harm it.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;p&gt;Dey's lab researches how microbes could be used to prevent and treat colon cancer, but everyone's gut microbiome is unique, he said.

To lower his colon&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cancer risk, first and foremost, Dey said he follows official advice to get screened.

Some studies show that taking vitamin D supplements daily may help lower blood pressure, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-does-the-research-say"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Does the Research Say? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research on how vitamin D supplements impact blood pressure is mixed. Some research has found that people with low &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/normal-vitamin-d-levels-by-age-8771592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypertension-treatment-1763942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when researchers look at what happens when people take &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-vitamin-d-useful-6386319" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplements regularly&lt;/a&gt;, the results are mixed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some studies show a small benefit, while others show no change at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What seems most promising is that vitamin D might help lower blood pressure if you already have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-blood-pressure-facts-5649309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-2224209" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; to begin with. In these cases, the supplement may offer a small boost in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/living-well-with-hypertension-1764117" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But even then, the blood pressure-lowering effect isn’t guaranteed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Older adults who are both low in vitamin D and have high blood pressure may benefit the most. For them, taking vitamin D may help improve blood pressure as part of an overall plan that includes a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/diet-or-exercise-for-blood-pressure-7563429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet, exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to how much vitamin D you should take to lower blood pressure. In research studies, the dose of vitamin D has ranged from 800 to 4,000 IU (international units) per day. Interestingly, higher doses don’t always lead to better results for blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Here are the general daily recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Infants (0–12 months): 400 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children and adults (1–70 years): 600 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults over 70: 800 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may need more, especially if they’re at higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-deficiency-3014720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This includes people with limited sun exposure, darker skin, certain health conditions, or older age. Many experts recommend around 1,000–2,000 IU per day for these groups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re unsure how much you need, talk to your doctor. They may order a simple blood test to check your vitamin D level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people can safely take vitamin D every day at the recommended amounts. But it is possible to take too much, especially if you’re using high-dose supplements for a long time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking too much vitamin D can lead to a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-vitamin-d-8401436" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt;. This can cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypercalcemia-in-cancer-patients-2249011" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high levels of calcium&lt;/a&gt; in your blood, which may lead to:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue or weakness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irregular heartbeat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney problems in severe cases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid this, stick with the daily recommendation for your age, and don’t exceed the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU per day unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

disease is the most common form of dementia and primarily affects people over the age of 65. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 7.2 million adults among that age bracket in the US are currently &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14095501/Now-deadly-disease-surging-young-people-warn-experts-amid-explosion-early-onset-cancers.html"&gt;living with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it each year.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Older adults who eat eggs more than once a week may be less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, a new study claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5527593/5-7-million-people-Alzheimers-costing-277-BILLION-year.html"&gt;warns that nearly 13 million Americans may be affected by 2050.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the disease, experts believe that cases of Alzheimer's are set to increase in the future due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To find the link between consuming eggs and the potential decrease in the risk of developing Alzheimer's, the researchers analyzed data from 1,024 dementia-free people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to fill in a well-known food frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard University that captures their typical diet over the previous year, including how often they ate eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once completed, they were followed by the researchers for nearly seven years and underwent yearly assessments for signs of Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists divided these participants into four groups based on how often they consumed eggs: less than once per month, one to three times per month, once per week and two or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The volunteer's answers as well as the data from their cognitive tests were then evaluated using various statistical models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the 1,024 living participants, another 578 participants donated their brains for research after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These brain samples allowed the scientists to assess whether egg intake was related to the presence of dementia-related markers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It remains unclear if all the deceased participants were suffering from dementia prior to their death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that people who ate eggs at least once a week had a lower rate of clinical Alzheimer's diagnosis than those who ate them rarely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who ate eggs more frequently also had significantly higher average choline levels over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this observational study did not expand on how choline can decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease by up to 40 percent, the scientists theorized that it's overall protective effect may play a critical role in protecting brain cells from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Choline is a nutrient essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that maintains the brain's memory and learning capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also plays a significant role in maintaining and protecting the structure of cell membranes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have shown that low choline levels in the blood are associated with increased levels of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - both of which are the main culprits in the development of the Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association warns that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans may be affected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles form when amyloid proteins misfold and stick together, forming sticky clumps (plaques) and when tau proteins twist and get tied up (tangles). These toxic buildups block brain cells, or neurons, from sending signals properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can impair brain functioning and lead to memory and muscle decline. If it persists, this disruption can cause permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the disease progresses, patients may lose the ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers believe that regularly consuming eggs can maintain choline levels in the body, which in turn can help maintain brain cell health and prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the liver produces choline in small amounts, experts say that it is necessary to consume food items such as egg yolks, fish, soybeans and legumes to maintain the required levels of the nutrient in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Institute of Health, adult women (above the age of 19) need to consume about 425 milligrams of choline per day while adult men need to consume 550 mg of the nutrient every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large hard boiled egg has about 147 mg of choline while half a cup of roasted soybeans contain about 107 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, three ounces of pan-fried beef liver contains about 356 mg of choline while three ounces of cooked fresh cod merely has 71 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:48:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQekVIUGVyS2V5anlNRGtqWkhPRno3WF9fNzhFNUlVMkdIQXFUNjZQbzlJWHRJWkFZaHhQUm1ydTV5cndvejNPQzVRX2tGdXAxcmNaSGpUclhiM1VHeHRjWDdqYmhYb3B4cWx6UFhoRlhuVm9sYXV4Z0loUk8tWnE4aEt2aGFVV0gtSHlSMGdjREdNSHJxX1N3cFBB</guid></item><item><title>如果你在40岁之后仍然在做这5个力量动作，那么你做错了-吃这个不是那个 | If You’re Still Doing These 5 Strength Moves After 40, You’re Doing It Wrong - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBXb2NzSWhuNUhZdHBTRFQ1cS0wQ3FBVmVKNnlwcDlwdk4tOTZnWFotVm1pTXlxSllsNjJ6dWZWZnZHNXpCMkcyeGlwbDRuRW1FT2V5TngydXhaTURKSnBWblB0cWlGc3VrVTlkbzdyOTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-training-mistakes-to-avoid/" target="_blank"&gt;Strength training&lt;/a&gt; is essential—especially as you age and the natural loss of muscle mass ensues. As long as you work out regularly, you will &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-training-exercises-to-build-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;build strength&lt;/a&gt; and be on a good track, right? Wrong! There are many popular strength habits that may be destroying your gains, and you don’t even know it. To learn what these common “bad habits” are when it comes to your workout, we spoke with &lt;b&gt;Luke Jones&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heromovement.net/" target="_blank"&gt;HERO Movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke tells us, “It’s worth noting that not every phase of training has to be about progressing. You might train for enjoyment, maintenance, or stress relief—all totally valid. But if building strength is the goal, small tweaks in load, reps, tempo, or complexity help stimulate the adaptation and growth you’re after.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;One point that’s noteworthy is that not every phase of working out needs to progress. It’s perfectly fine to train for maintenance, to relieve stress, and for your enjoyment. But if strength building is your mission, it’s crucial to be mindful of your reps, speed, load, and the difficulty of your workout in order to help kick up the muscle build you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s delve into the common strength training habits you may be doing with good intentions, but may actually stall your progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies respond best when the stimulus shifts slightly now and then—whether that’s more load, slower tempo, shorter rest period or just a different rep range,” Luke says. “It doesn’t mean we have to be improving every single session—it’s more about the long-term trend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a movement isn’t performed with good form, why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting stronger usually means lifting heavier at some point, but ideally not at the expense of movement quality,” Luke points out. “There’s a time and place for chasing PBs, and it can be fun to test yourself now and then. But going all out all the time takes its toll, so I’d much rather see people prioritizing technique, recovery, and incremental progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke explains, “Big lifts are great—they’re fun, rewarding, and often get center stage. But they’re not the full story. Mobility work, shoulder stabilization, and accessory movements can make a real difference to how we move, how we feel, and how long we can keep doing it all. You don’t need to go overboard—just enough to keep things ticking over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything you jump into without thinking about is a total time-waster—and that includes your workout plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Training without any structure—whether it’s progression, variety, or planned recovery—can work for some, but for others leads to overwhelm and a loss of motivation,” Luke tells us. “A bit of forethought, whether that’s following a program, working with a coach, or even just choosing when to push and when to back off, can make a big difference. It doesn’t need to be complicated to be effective!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pushing hard every session is often touted as the best way to train, but the reality is that going all out all the time isn’t sustainable,” says Luke. “It’s in the rest between sessions—sleeping, recovering, taking care of ourselves—where the real rebuilding happens. A little attention to the basics, like nutrition and managing stress, can go a long way in helping you get more from the work in the gym.”&lt;/p&gt;

The LE8 includes eight specific health behaviors and factors to help determine a person’s heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be more active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get healthy sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eight components identified by the American Heart Association as being linked to cardiovascular disease risk are already well established,” El Khoudary explained. “What remains unclear, however, is how well women in midlife are doing in relation to these components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6784846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the menopause transition is really a critical turning point, a time when women experience changes in many components of Life’s Essential 8,” she continued. “So, women really need to work to counteract all of those changes in midlife to protect their cardiovascular health in the ensuing years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, El Khoudary and her team found that four LE8 components — managing blood sugar and blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use — were the main factors driving study participants’ future heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is important because it highlights key areas … that may have the greatest impact on future heart health for women,” El Khoudary explained. “However, our study did not test whether targeting these specifically leads to better outcomes than focusing on other factors. This is an important question for future clinical trials to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that only one in five menopausal women have an ideal LE8 score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we compare this to the general population, the prevalence is very close,” El Khoudary said. “There’s very low prevalence of optimal LE8 scores. Unfortunately, many people still need to do more, including women who are in this vulnerable stage, the menopause transition. Of course, that’s easier said than done! There are many barriers to living up to Life’s Essential 8. And there is also a lack of awareness. We need to continue to work to address both of those challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next, we need to understand why many midlife women struggle to maintain ideal heart health and what barriers they face. Research should focus on testing interventions targeting glucose, blood pressure, nicotine use, and sleep to reduce long-term risk. Improving sleep quality also deserves more attention. Ultimately, finding effective ways to help women adopt and stick to healthy habits is key.”&lt;br&gt;— Samar R.

The Northeast was the hardest-hit region, according to the CDC. For every 100,000 ER visits in the region in June, 229 were for tick bites, up from 167 in June the year before, according to agency data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z4Y3FLWXDZDKLMSIJHZSRSSCDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Tick bites are responsible for a few diseases, with the most common one being Lyme disease, a bacterial infection characterized by a bull’s eye rash and flu-like symptoms. The CDC received more than 89,000 reports of Lyme disease in 2023,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;but on its website, it also says “estimates using other methods suggest that approximately 476,000 people may be diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXAQFZ7LOVFR3KZ2O34OIPEOGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This year, as of July 8,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the D.C. Department of Health had received 38 Lyme disease case reports from all eight wards. The highest proportion of cases were in Ward 1.

The Virginia Department of Health has reported 297 “confirmed or probable” tick-borne illnesses, of which 248 are Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NF6E6NGAVVHJFKGNWFPPRVVK5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ticks are also responsible for babesiosis, a malaria-like disease characterized by fever-like symptoms, and alpha-gal syndrome, a disease that causes an allergy to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you might be seeing more ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EULQKZGRFDFVHK6YVX7GA6BKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One reason behind the increase in ticks is climate change. The area’s longer warm periods and milder winters create conditions that make it easier for ticks to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHGJLIZAC5DSRHJMHWSXU7T6QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Climate change is also responsible for the influx of the lone star tick, which was previously found only in the southern United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BK32N5DJ6BFAXMUT42C7PBAU4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another factor is the population of animals, like deer and white-footed mice, that ticks latch onto. A lack of large predators and hunting restrictions, combined with an abundance in food, allow these animal populations to thrive. Years where oak trees produce a large amount of acorns are called mast years. The year after mast years is when tick populations can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PQKPLKIDIBE7DBLFTH4CP23VEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Then we would expect to see greater transmission, because we now have higher populations of infected mice, infected ticks, and a greater ability to transmit, a greater probability that the tick will carry the Lyme disease and give it to a human,” Raupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do when you find a tick&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPJCYQLXA5A3BMNO6SLAJHS6VA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you spot a tick making a meal of you, the standard protocol is to grasp it&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with forceps as close to the skin as possible and remove it. Instinct may lead a person to throw it away or squish it. But entomologists actually want you to do something else: collect the tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZFXCDSNJNEKHJMTDHLFSJFWGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia’s Department of Health has the Citizen Tick Survey, which asks users to submit either a photo or the tick itself and answer a few questions. Eleanor Labgold, a state public health entomologist at the Virginia Department of Health, says she would “love” for people to use it more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I33BUZKWGZGKTN2FNZJOJWJTYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We’ll also provide you information to say, ‘Okay, this is your tick.

So if you’re going to go out for a hike, if you can, stay on the trail, [stay on] the paved surface,” he advised. “I’m going to wear light-colored clothing, tuck my pant legs into my socks. This forces the tick to walk up and over, much easier to find, rather than under your pants. You can treat your hiking shoes or your clothing with a tick repellent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EL3AYTNLUVF25KA662QQKJPQ4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He suggested people also throw their clothes in the dryer, on a medium to high heat cycle for 20 minutes, as soon as they get home to kill any ticks that hitched a ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6AKMJI6Z2BBVBOUI5RCYRLUABI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Next is inspection, for both people and pets.

Get a helper to see those hard-to-see spots behind there, and do a tick inspection,” Raupp said, before moving on to the final step: remove. “If you can get those ticks off quickly, the probability of contracting a tick-borne illness diminishes dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TACWY4VM2VFOJOWES6QSGLX3LA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He and other bug experts advised that people who find ticks on them or their children should keep an eye out for the typical symptoms of tick-related illnesses: the bull’s eye rash, persistent flu-like symptoms and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GUUF4XB4PZAI5OY6WH45FLFZSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The information may be overwhelming, but they said it’s important to not let ticks keep you indoors this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O5K7DTLGP5BONKWKVWJOBY5RNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Enjoy the great outdoors,” Labgold said. “I know ticks can cause paranoia.

                &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — It was the scariest choking incident David Palumbo had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 88-year-old man had been dining at a Providence, Rhode Island, Italian restaurant in September 2019. Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man’s skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I’ve been on in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It’s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation’s retirement-age population grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choking is a danger to older adults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best ways to stop choking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that’s where their products can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antichoking devices aren’t always risk-free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dechoker-llc-614629-05102021"&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dechoker in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that’s not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-encourages-public-follow-established-choking-rescue-protocols-fda-safety-communication"&gt;notice to consumers&lt;/a&gt; that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More research is needed, choking expert says&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it’s tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(24)00151-5/fulltext"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

That means any new outbreaks during that time must come from people who contracted the virus from outside, not inside, the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is considered the best defense in stopping measles outbreaks. Unfortunately vaccine rates have been dropping in recent years.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that criteria, the U.S. has until January to eliminate the nation’s current outbreaks, which is a year after cases started domestically in Texas, according to epidemiology experts. If it doesn’t, the U.S.’s measles elimination status could be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be more impactful than a lot of Americans think about since we have had measles elimination status for so long,” Brittany Kmush, associate professor and graduate director of Syracuse University’s Public Health Department, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could affect U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to specific countries if they don’t want the risk of measles getting introduced to their country. It could affect other people’s ability to come visit the U.S. Other countries might require proof of measles vaccination before they can reenter their home country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could also be increased quarantine and isolation requirements, with potential economic fallout, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, many more people could be at risk of contracting the virus, which is considered one of the most contagious in the world. If just one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just a cold for a lot of people. It can lead to phenomena and in rare cases encephalitis and death,” said Kmush. Children younger than 5 years of age are especially vulnerable to severe illness and health complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s still time this year to fight outbreaks. Losing the elimination status is also purposely made challenging because, unless the virus is globally eradicated ― a feat only seen with smallpox ― there’s always going to be cases brought into the U.S. from outside, said William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center, who co-leads the school’s measles tracking project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as there’s measles virus circulating somewhere in the world, there’s always going to be these importations,” he told HuffPost.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It would be very hard to maintain measles elimination status if every time someone brought it in and there was another case, you would lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not outbreaks will stop before the deadline remains uncertain, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. have been dropping since their peak in March, giving hope that outbreaks may be petering out. But vaccination rates remain at their lowest in years in the U.S., reducing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="so-called “herd immunity”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687148e4e4b07da2c0819b46" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;so-called “herd immunity”&lt;/a&gt; and opening the door for new outbreaks to ignite in communities that have low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Measles cases have been dropping this year since hitting a peak in March.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak,” said Moss, while comparing the chances to a hot ember drifting from a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it lands in a wet area, you’re not going to have an outbreak if there’s high vaccine coverage. But if it enters an area with really low vaccine coverage, you could have another really large outbreak,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than six months left in the year, Moss says it’s still too early to start a countdown or “really sweat about this.” He also said that even if elimination status is lost, cases are at least unlikely to return to the levels seen in the early 1990s, since vaccine levels do remain reasonably high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kmush, however, expressed more caution on the chances of elimination being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am definitely alarmed,” she said, while pointing out that the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status in 2019 when there were fewer cases than those seen this year. She credited a rise in vaccine coverage and public health advocacy toward the end of that year for sparing the U.S. from losing its status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to get them vaccinated and do the quarantine and isolation,” she said of vulnerable communities. “Unfortunately, measles vaccination rates are even lower now than they were in 2019 and 99% of the cases that have been reported in this outbreak are either not vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Measles cases are unlikely to rise to the levels seen 35 years ago, thanks to high vaccine rates. There were 17,914 cases in 1989 and 27,808 cases in 1990, according to the CDC.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Moss both also stressed that the U.S. getting its elimination status back after losing it is also no easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country would have to show zero continuous transmission of the virus domestically for 36 months, as well as demonstrate a good virus surveillance system, which Moss said the U.S. does have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as what can be done now, Kmush said more people need to get vaccinated, calling it “the greatest tool” in decreasing cases and protecting those who are unable to get vaccinated, such as babies younger than six months of age or people who are immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can do quarantine, isolation, similar to the idea with COVID, but measles is a lot more contagious than COVID,” she said. “And so we really need everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also stressed that federal health officials need to do more to reduce vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think certain administrators and their views on vaccines have been fueling some of this vaccine hesitancy and people’s reluctance to receive a vaccine that’s been proven safe and effective for decades,” she said. “The policies and some of the vaccine hesitancy and skepticism rhetoric is definitely dangerous and going to make people who are unsure about vaccines even more unsure, when they really shouldn’t be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of South Australia (UniSA) have developed a long-acting injectable formulation that delivers a steady dose of levodopa and carbidopa - two key medications for Parkinson's - over an entire week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings have been reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biodegradable formulation is injected under the skin or into muscle tissue, where it gradually releases the medication over seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting more than 8.5 million people worldwide. Currently there is no cure and the symptoms - tremors, rigidity and slow movement - are managed with oral medications that must be taken several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequent dosing is a burden, especially for elderly patients or those with swallowing difficulties, leading to inconsistent medication levels, more side effects, and reduced effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Professor Sanjay Garg, from UniSA's Centre for Pharmaceutical Innovation, says the newly developed injectable could significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient adherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to create a formulation that simplifies treatment, improves patient compliance, and maintains consistent therapeutic levels of medication. This weekly injection could be a game-changer for Parkinson's care," Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson's, but its short life span means it must be taken several times a day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniSA PhD student Deepa Nakmode says the in-situ implant is designed to release both levodopa and carbidopa steadily over one week, maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing the risks associated with fluctuating drug concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After years of focused research, it's incredibly rewarding to see our innovation in long-acting injectables for Parkinson's disease reach this stage. Our invention has now been filed for an Australian patent," Nakmode says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injectable gel combines an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer PLGA with Eudragit L-100, a pH-sensitive polymer, to achieve a controlled and sustained drug release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive lab tests confirmed the system's effectiveness and safety:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;More than 90% of the levodopa dose and more than 81% of the carbidopa dose was released over seven days.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The implant degraded by over 80% within a week and showed no significant toxicity in cell viability tests.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The formulation can be easily administered through a fine 22-gauge needle, minimising discomfort and eliminating the need for surgical implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The implications of this research are profound," Prof Garg says. "By reducing the frequency of dosing from multiple times a day to a weekly injection is a major step forward in Parkinson's therapy. We're not just improving how the drug is delivered; we're improving patients' lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Garg says the technology could also be adapted for other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, pain management, and chronic infections that require long-term drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system can be tuned to release drugs over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks depending on therapeutic needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniSA scientists hope to start clinical trials in the near future and are exploring commercialisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Individuals with ADHD showed reduced activation in key brain areas involved in self-awareness and decision-making. Among those with ADHD, women showed more activity in several of these regions than men, pointing to possible sex-related differences in how the brain processes decisions that involve uncertainty. The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70215" target="_blank"&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is typically thought of as a childhood condition, but it often continues into adulthood. Many adults with ADHD struggle with impulsivity, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These difficulties can translate into behaviors that put them at greater risk, such as reckless driving, unsafe sex, substance use, or gambling. While previous studies have explored how people with ADHD respond to the outcomes of decisions, less is known about what happens in the brain before a decision is made—especially in emotionally charged or intuitive situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand this anticipatory phase, the researchers focused on the role of unconscious and emotional processes that guide decision-making. They were particularly interested in how bodily sensations—like a quickened heartbeat or a gut feeling—might influence behavior in people with ADHD. This idea is grounded in the “somatic marker hypothesis,” which proposes that the body’s physical response to emotionally relevant information plays a role in guiding choices. The study also aimed to explore whether men and women with ADHD might show different patterns of brain activity in this context, given known sex differences in how the disorder presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 38 adults, including 18 with ADHD (10 women and 8 men) and 20 without the disorder (10 women and 10 men). Participants were screened to ensure they met diagnostic criteria and did not have other major psychiatric or neurological conditions. Most of the participants with ADHD had been taking stimulant medication but were asked to pause use 24 hours before the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed a task known as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, or BART, while undergoing brain imaging in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The task involved watching a virtual balloon inflate on a screen and deciding when to stop it before it popped. The longer they waited, the more points they could earn—but if the balloon burst before they stopped it, they would lose all the points for that round. This version of the task was designed to encourage fast, intuitive decisions rather than deliberate calculation. Reaction time—the delay between the start of the balloon inflation and when the participant pressed the stop button—was used as a behavioral measure of risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants completed the task, researchers measured activity in their brains during the anticipation phase of each decision, before they acted. This allowed the team to examine what parts of the brain were engaged in preparing for the risky choice. They also compared results by group (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) and by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of behavior, participants with and without ADHD showed similar reaction times on average, suggesting that the groups did not differ in observable risk-taking behavior. However, the brain imaging data told a different story. Individuals with ADHD showed significantly lower activation in two specific brain areas: the right precuneus and the right superior frontal gyrus. These areas are thought to play important roles in self-awareness, internal monitoring, and integrating emotional information—functions that are often disrupted in people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precuneus is involved in tasks that require self-reflection and awareness of internal states. It has also been linked to emotion processing and the ability to monitor bodily sensations. Meanwhile, the superior frontal gyrus is thought to help integrate cognitive and emotional information and is involved in controlling impulses. The researchers found that lower activity in these areas was associated with more severe ADHD symptoms, suggesting a link between brain function and the difficulties experienced by people with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed interesting differences between men and women with ADHD. While no sex differences in brain activity were found in the group without the disorder, women with ADHD showed greater activation in several brain regions compared to men with ADHD. These included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insula, the caudate, the cuneus, and the precuneus. These areas are associated with emotion regulation, attention, and self-monitoring. The findings may suggest that women with ADHD engage more of their brain’s regulatory systems during the anticipation of a decision, possibly as a compensatory strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result was unexpected, given that earlier studies have found that women with ADHD may experience more difficulties with emotional regulation and internalizing symptoms like anxiety. One possible explanation is that women with stronger emotional processing skills may show less neural activation during emotional tasks, suggesting a more efficient processing style. Alternatively, women with ADHD may develop strategies that mask their symptoms, including more active engagement of brain areas that help regulate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that, despite these brain differences, men and women did not show significant differences in reaction time on the task. This suggests that people may arrive at similar outward behavior through different internal processes, a finding that highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level performance in psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights, it also has limitations. The sample size was relatively small, particularly when broken down by both sex and diagnosis, which limits how broadly the findings can be applied. Additionally, although participants were asked to stop taking ADHD medications 24 hours before the study, some effects of the medication may have lingered and influenced brain activity. The study also focused on young adults, so it may not capture how these processes change with age or in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger samples and longer medication washout periods will be important for confirming and expanding on these findings. In particular, researchers may benefit from combining brain imaging with physiological measures, like heart rate or skin conductance, to get a fuller picture of how the body and brain interact during decision-making. This approach could help build a more complete model of how emotions and bodily signals influence the choices made by people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70215" target="_blank"&gt;Neural Correlates and Sex-Specific Effects of Affectively Driven Processes Underlying Decision-Making in Adult ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eva Halbe, Alec Jamieson, Moritz Bergmann, Aylin Mehren, Ben J.

Keep on doing what you’re doing’... things like that, that really tug at your heart,” says Will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gaming can help people with a variety of ailments, says Dr Kris Alexander, a leading authority in video game design and associate professor of media production at Toronto Metropolitan University who helped launch &lt;a href="https://gamerx.ca/about-gamerx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;GameRx&lt;/a&gt;, an online resource hub for information about wellness and gaming. One 2017 study found that “if you play Tetris within 48 hours of a traumatic experience, you can reduce PTSD”, he tells me. “There are studies that show that if you place burn victims in virtual reality in spaces where they’re surrounded by cold elements, you can reduce their pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alexander believes gaming can be good for seniors; over a video call, he shows me the custom arcade cabinet he’s built to house every game he’s ever owned. “For my retirement,” he tells me. “Absolutely, when I get older, I’m going to be playing video games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, common conditions like joint pain and vision decline can hinder senior gamers. As that demographic grows, so may demand for accessibility tools. And because the senior player base is relatively small, Alexander acknowledges that the high-budget gaming companies behind blockbuster titles like Call of Duty and Skyrim are unlikely to account for such needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2010, Will required surgery implanting a steel plate in his skull; since then, if he sits in a chair “for more than 20 or 30 minutes, everything from the shoulders down to the fingertips goes numb”, he says. Now, he uses a hand-shaped gaming keypad called the Azeron Cyborg II, which allows users with limited hand mobility or strength to position PC keys so they’re easy and comfortable to reach. Other adaptive controllers, including &lt;a href="https://www.voicebot.net/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voice-control technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/adaptive-gaming-equipment/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pedals&lt;/a&gt; designed for control by foot or mouth, and&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 3D printable controller modifications&lt;/a&gt; for consoles like the Xbox and Playstation, are all making gaming increasingly accessible across playing formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Will hopes that other seniors who see him stream will be inspired to get into gaming. “If I can do it at my age with this handicap, you can, too,” he says. After all, you’re never too old to respawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f248018d-3b1c-46a6-bfbf-67028560c94c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement" class="element element-atom dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figure class="interactive interactive-atom dcr-e6xisx" data-atom-id="interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNb2x2ZWpCcFV2eWpnQnZ5RUZWTlJrNnU1b2xUM29ianRJcjVGdXpFSWl1aVJhUl83ZnNnajlxa3d4RjdSc0poNWVnS0ZXQUNIOHBWMXQyNE5kdnNBUUhNaVppbHVsejdjalczTEphcnVaNW9jUUc0dXlYeGZwdTFrd2l3OUVKUElveDJJNjdKOVRvZnNBamZhVA</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的止痛药可能会增加痴呆风险- Gizmodo | This Common Pain Med Could Be Raising Dementia Risk - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNcGprYml2V0szbkxaTzB4ZE9aWXlITnA5amtEUjZqY1hCUkZHNFpZRGpFZWpfamoyTUY0aVpaQ244RmE1QXQxSWNrVzcyQXVQNkgzdXF0SWo5Ti1RRWtyVFdzVHRKeGN5ZFlWRVpQNkRITzdkdFVCMzNZcnY4US1xWVRaUUNyWkNvR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain can be a debilitating experience. A common medication used to manage the condition may come with its own serious dangers, however. Recent research finds an upsetting link between the drug gabapentin and a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University led the study, which examined the medical records of people with chronic low back pain. People taking gabapentin for their back were significantly more likely to develop dementia over time compared to non-users, they found. The results suggest that doctors ought to be more aware of this potential complication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21561-gabapentin"&gt;Gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-seizure drug that’s also regularly used to manage nerve pain and restless leg syndrome. And it’s sometimes used to treat chronic low back pain, especially if the nerves are thought to be involved. The drug primarily works by reducing the abnormal electric activity of the brain’s neurons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As useful as gabapentin can be, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.910719/full"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;—if not &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/62/4/372?ijkey=ed64845ba5414944ceea85840286c984e871ac11&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt;—research has suggested a possible link to dementia and cognitive impairment. To better understand this potential risk, the study researchers examined its use among chronic low back pain patients. They analyzed the medical records of over 26,000 patients diagnosed with back pain between 2004 and 2024, comparing similar groups of patients who either were or weren’t prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who were prescribed gabapentin six or more times were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (roughly 30% more likely) and mild cognitive impairment (85% more) than those who weren’t, the researchers found. This increase in relative risk was higher in people under the age of 65 as well as in those taking 12 or more prescriptions of gabapentin (compared to people receiving fewer prescriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These sorts of retrospective studies can only demonstrate a correlation between two things, not prove a clear cause-and-effect relationship. But the findings should motivate further research, both to confirm whether this link is genuine and to figure out the exact mechanisms behind it, the researchers argue. And for now, doctors should at least be more careful in how they prescribe gabapentin, including being more proactive in tracking the cognitive health of their patients taking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results support the need for close monitoring in adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Unlike bubonic plague, which killed millions in medieval Europe, it can be spread through airborne droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While both are caused by the &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium, bubonic plague is transmitted through rodent flea bites or contact with contaminated material – and it primarily affects the lymph nodes while pneumonic plague causes pneumonia and respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Authorities said the person, whose age, name and gender have not been released, had entered the Flagstaff Medical Center emergency department and died on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hospital operator Northern Arizona Healthcare&lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; said in a statement &lt;/a&gt;that “despite appropriate initial management and attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation, the patient did not recover”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The death of the Coconino county resident marks the first recorded pneumonic plague death in the county in 18 years but not the most recent human plague case in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; – the state has recorded seven cases of plague since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about seven human cases of plague are reported annually across the country, but only&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 plague deaths&lt;/a&gt; have been recorded in a 23-year period beginning in 2000. Most cases have been seen in rural areas in the west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, the CDC says, &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; cycles naturally among wild rodents. And while most people contract the disease though flea bites, they can become infected through exposure to sick pets, especially cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The plague death comes as officials in the county are investigating a sudden die-off of prairie dogs north-east of Flagstaff that may be caused by plague. County officials have said they do not think the human plague death and the prairie dog mortalities are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But they also issued guidelines about how to avoid contracting the plague, including avoiding contact with wild animals, touching sick or dead animals, camping near rodent burrows, or sleeping directly on the ground. They advise using insect repellent and tucking the cuffs of your trouser leg into your socks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Coconino county health officials said the risk of human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague is low. The last such transmission was in Los Angeles in 1924, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2595158/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, the symptoms of the Black Death – named for black spots that appeared on infected bodies – remain present. US health officials say plague symptoms typically appear within eight days after exposure and may include fever, chills, headache, weakness and muscle pain, and some may develop swollen lymph nodes (called “buboes”), most commonly in the groin, armpits or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the timing of the human plague death, and the prairie dog die-off, is raising concerns. Plague is one of many diseases endemic to the south-western US, including West Nile virus, hantavirus and rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trish Lees, communications manager for Coconino county,&lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2025/07/09/prairie-dogs-dying-arizona/84512692007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; told the Arizona Republic &lt;/a&gt;the number of prairie dogs that have died was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQMEl2UG5lbW81SDJHLV8tRldoMGNhU2VkZW5OOW5NWWdKcGw3eVNCMHJQdTQyUG9sXzdackUzbWFjMEFXS1I3UjVBbTFLamFTZ2pVYm0wdTN3N1ItSktWYnZTNWRpclduX0VwU09kUy1meEdMalQxTGU5QS1tamZPc205eXg</guid></item><item><title>卫生部：保护自己免受蚊子的侵害-特立尼达和多巴哥新闻日报 | MoH: Protect yourself from mosquitoes - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9NTEJqdm82ai14eHo1T1dVSVRaV3J2UUU4Wkg3eHowUzMxdVZBSjFqdFhwX1VlQWZWZTNBcF9EZ1laRlE0LXJpTW85c0h3ZGpNRnlSc0xweDREcWRqSlZsTk9nYU1FcW1pbHFSS25nYWNERk5OUmJpWlNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23238053-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="An Aedes aegypti mosquito. - AFP PHOTO  "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An Aedes aegypti mosquito. - AFP PHOTO  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health (MoH) is reminding the public to protect themselves from mosquito bites as the rainy season progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry, in a media release on July 13, noted the Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said it closely monitors any trends or changes in general population health, with specific attention to expected seasonal variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While there has been no increase in persons presenting with dengue fever to accident and emergency departments across TT, enhanced surveillance activities by the Insect Vector Control Division (IVCD), the Epidemiology Unit and numerous satellite surveillance units within the community are ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added this is consistent with its wider established protocols utilised for the prevention, control and constant monitoring of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue fever symptoms appear within 5-6 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito and can last for one-two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms include fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, skin rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said, “Anyone showing signs or symptoms of dengue fever should seek immediate medical treatment at their doctor or the nearest health facility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry also reminded citizens the best way to reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases is by eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged the public to dispose of all unwanted articles, derelict vehicles or appliances left outdoors which can collect water and become a breeding ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added water containers such as tanks, barrels, drums or buckets should be covered with mosquito-proof covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are also urged to keep their surroundings clean by cutting and removing all bush or undergrowth that can harbour mosquitoes and cleaning drains and guttering to allow for the free flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are encouraged to use mosquito nets and insect repellent, when appropriate, as a means of personal protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes to contact the IVCD for vector control measures can call 612-4823 ext 5456/5402.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not spread from person to person but rather through bites from infected mosquitoes. The insects pick up the virus from birds, the natural reservoir for the virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those with certain chronic conditions face the highest risk of severe illness due to West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even survivors of severe West Nile illness may experience long-lasting complications, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6127023/Nebraska-man-says-paralyzed-left-partially-deaf-contracting-West-Nile-virus.html"&gt;including memory problems, chronic fatigue, muscle tremors, or permanent neurological damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the leading mosquito-borne disease in the US and is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes. Most cases occur during mosquito season, which typically begins in the spring and lasts through the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) Vector Control Specialist Nicholas Baldauf said: 'Generally, the species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus are active from dusk to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Residents can prevent mosquito bites by using insect repellent on exposed skin or choosing to wear long sleeves and pants. Both methods are effective at reducing or eliminating the possibility of getting a mosquito bite.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anne Dillard, &lt;span&gt;an Atlanta woman, was left 'practically paralyzed' from the waist down after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She collapsed at home and was rushed to Emory University Hospital, where doctors confirmed the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite retaining sensation, she lost muscle strength, leaving her unable to sit, stand, or walk. She also suffered from lethargy, loss of appetite, and a spreading rash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anne Dillard, from Atlanta, Georgia, revealed that she had been 'practically paralyzed' by her West Nile Virus infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her case emerged just minutes after Dr Anthony Fauci revealed his own West Nile diagnosis, highlighting how even healthy individuals can face severe symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile John Proctor VI, an 18-year-old from Missouri became paralyzed from the neck down and relies on a ventilator to breathe after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The previously healthy teen, who recently graduated high school and was training to become a diesel mechanic, first developed headaches and dizziness in early August before his condition rapidly worsened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, he suffered slurred speech, muscle weakness, and paralysis, prompting his parents to rush him to the hospital fearing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13575965/west-nile-virus-outbreak-officials-concerned-record-high-cases-states.html"&gt;confirmed a rare neuro-invasive form of West Nile virus, which attacks the nervous system.&lt;/a&gt; His father described the ordeal as 'out of nowhere' and said his son is now battling stroke-like symptoms and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure, only rest and pain management, and recovery can take months, often with lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile, first detected in 1999, now appears nationwide, causing about 2,200 severe cases and 180 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every spring, the ACHD treats known mosquito breeding sites with larvicide and sets traps to monitor for West Nile and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Proctor VI is on ventilator to help him breathe after being diagnosed with West Nile virus.

They mainly live near stagnant water sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne disease experts are increasingly alarmed that as global temperatures climb toward dangerous new thresholds, warmer, wetter, and more humid conditions will take hold in regions that were once too cool for large mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These shifting climates create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, extending their active season and speeding up their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As species like Culex mosquitoes expand into new areas, their longer lifespans and faster viral incubation times give them more opportunities to spread dangerous illnesses, not just West Nile virus, but also malaria, dengue fever, and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department urges people to protect themselves by clearing standing water from their yards, using screens on windows and doors, and applying insect repellent to exposed skin, particularly during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPbWlmaDVnWEZZRjBpUGJ4RngtUVNENmVRcE9uN3NBUmhNaGt6NU9pNk91UjFNcGlUbDRzTGdqU0JLb3ZSZE15dE5NUFY1dV8tdl9PU19SVFgyelUzYzNvenN0cWQ5dTlSM09LYVRlZUU5dGZaekl5WHFpeUZ1b05Zb2thdHl6b1p1TmFwd1psdWo0akdoanpNdF9hekZGZDlQYXZoVmJIVVVVQdIBrwFBVV95cUxOSk9YaGt1RkZHX3lvOWRBQk9sNjBid1Nqa19XbTJ5MGxGb2xsZW5mWF9FZVZvMGpsQ2wtc1hoWHNuMm1iRHpxcC1pMmdCT1d5b3U2eVBSNkFuTzhadmlLOUUwR0FkZFYydjl4SVhNTjI4bktSOV9JNy1hYVVBeUZjVk13OVFGdlFQZXdXNmRldXkxczNyVEJJdmZ1aEhpeGdaYV9qYjlndDMxSFpEVGxR</guid></item><item><title>来自卫生部长的登革热警告-特立尼达快报 | Dengue fever warning from Health Minister - Trinidad Express Newspapers</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Health Minister Dr Lackram Bodoe says anyone showing symptoms of dengue fever should seek immediate medical treatment at a doctor or the nearest health facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister told the Express yesterday that there is no overcrowding of hospitals with dengue cases, and he urged people not to self-medicate at home but to seek medical care if they experience dengue symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will be meeting with the Insect Vector Control Division today to get an update on data and other information with respect to dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release earlier yesterday, the Ministry stated that while there has been no increase in people presenting with dengue fever to Accident and Emergency departments across Trinidad and Tobago, enhanced surveillance activities by the Insect Vector Control Division, the Epidemiology Unit and satellite surveillance units within the community are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with the ministry’s wider established protocols utilised for the prevention, control, and constant monitoring of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue fever may be spread by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms appear within 5–6 days of being bitten, last for 1–2 weeks, and can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Fever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Headaches (sometimes severe)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pain behind eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Muscle and joint pains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Skin rash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Nausea/vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Diarrhoea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source Reduction Tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health further advised citizens that the best means of reducing the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases is through the elimination of the breeding sites of the Aedes species mosquito. The public is urged to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dispose of all unwanted articles, derelict vehicles or appliances in the yard or environs which can collect water and become mosquito breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cover water containers such as tanks, barrels, drums or buckets with a mosquito-proof covering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cut down and remove all bush or undergrowth that can harbour mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Clean drains and guttering to allow for the free flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Use mosquito nets and insect repellent, when appropriate, as a means of personal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wishing to contact the Insect Vector Control Division (IVCD) for vector control measures can call 612-4823 ext 5456/5402.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us have heard that advice more times than we can count. But what if the best way to treat high blood pressure doesn’t involve running miles or lifting heavy weights? What if the most effective exercise is one where you barely move at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new analysis published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; challenges decades of assumptions about how we should approach blood pressure control. The study dives deep into nearly three decades of clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its surprising conclusion? Static strength &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-to-maximize-the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt; like wall sits and planks may be more effective at reducing blood pressure than popular choices like cardio or high intensity interval training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team behind the study set out to uncover the most effective forms of exercise to prevent and manage arterial hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings not only expand our understanding of how exercise influences blood pressure, but also call for a major update to current medical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-types-and-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercise types and blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers systematically reviewed 270 randomized controlled trials conducted between 1990 and February 2023. These trials involved a total of 15,827 participants and explored how various forms of exercise affect resting blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare outcomes fairly, the researchers categorized &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-feels-better-when-its-matched-to-your-personality/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; routines into five main groups: aerobic training, dynamic resistance training, combined training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), and isometric exercise training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic training included activities such as walking, running, and cycling. Dynamic resistance training referred to exercises that involve movement and weight, like squats or push-ups. Combined training used both aerobic and resistance approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIIT referred to short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low intensity recovery. Finally, isometric training focused on muscle engagement without visible movement, such as wall sits or planks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed both systolic blood pressure (SBP), the pressure during heartbeats, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the pressure between beats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced statistical tools like Bayesian network meta-analysis, they compared all five exercise categories head to head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercises-for-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercises for lower blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All five types of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-reduces-depression-and-anxiety-in-children-and-teens-with-mental-health-issues/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; reduced blood pressure significantly. But not all changes were equal. Isometric training emerged as the clear leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of exercise led to an average systolic reduction of 8.24 mmHg and a diastolic drop of 4.00 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, combined training lowered systolic pressure by 6.04 mmHg. Dynamic resistance came next with 4.55 mmHg, followed by aerobic training at 4.49 mmHg and HIIT at 4.08 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic pressure showed a similar trend. Isometric training again topped the list with a 4 mmHg reduction, followed by resistance training at 3.04 mmHg, combined training at 2.54 mmHg, aerobic training at 2.53 mmHg, and HIIT at 2.50 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, isometric exercise training is the most effective mode in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may seem surprising at first. After all, isometric exercises don’t involve much movement. But their intensity and sustained muscle contraction appear to create powerful cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-best-routines-for-blood-pressure"&gt;Best routines for blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t just stop at general categories. It also looked at specific forms of exercise within each group that helped with blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all the routines analyzed, wall squats produced the most powerful drop in systolic pressure, averaging 10.47 mmHg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to diastolic pressure, running delivered the biggest benefit, with an average reduction of 5.67 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other standout performers included cycling, which had stronger effects than walking in both pressure types. Walking, though widely recommended, showed the smallest benefit in this comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-for-people-with-hypertension"&gt;Benefits for people with hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, aerobic training showed greater blood pressure reductions when performed less frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data suggested that training three times per week produced better results than training five times per week or more. This finding applied only to aerobic training and not to the other exercise modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found that people with hypertension experienced the largest improvements. For them, isometric training lowered systolic pressure by as much as 12.2 mmHg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the average drop was about 6.65 mmHg in people with normal blood pressure. This suggests that the benefits are even more pronounced in those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-does-hiit-fit-in"&gt;Where does HIIT fit in?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High intensity interval &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; has gained popularity in recent years due to its time efficiency and metabolic benefits. However, in this review, HIIT ranked lowest among all exercise types for lowering systolic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When broken down further, sprint interval training (SIT) showed some benefit, while aerobic interval training (AIT) failed to reach statistical significance for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that intensity does play a role. While walking had modest effects, running and cycling offered stronger outcomes. This highlights the importance of exercise quality over quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though HIIT didn’t lead the rankings, the authors acknowledged its growing appeal. It remains a practical choice for people short on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those seeking the strongest impact on blood pressure, isometric holds may offer more powerful results in a shorter span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-update-exercise-guidelines"&gt;The need to update exercise guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current exercise guidelines for blood pressure control focus primarily on aerobic activities. But those guidelines are based on older data. This review brings in newer research, including many more trials on isometric and HIIT workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings provide a comprehensive data driven framework to support the development of new exercise guideline recommendations for the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted that blood pressure reductions from isometric training are comparable to those seen with standard dose antihypertensive medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes isometric exercise a powerful tool for people who either can’t tolerate medication or want to try non drug approaches first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some doctors may still be unfamiliar with using static holds as a prescription, the science is catching up quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field now has much more confidence in the effectiveness of these routines, thanks to a growing number of well conducted trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-exercises-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Simple exercises lower blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the simplest exercises, those that require no equipment, no running, and very little space, may do the most for your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall sits, planks, and other isometric exercises demand effort without motion, yet offer results that rival, and in some cases exceed, more traditional workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing high blood pressure or trying to avoid it, consider adding static holds to your weekly routine. The evidence is now stronger than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few short sessions per week could make a measurable difference and might even take the pressure off your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are from &lt;a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Canterbury Christ Church University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://le.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Leicester&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/20/1317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:55:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNU1hzTXlNY2R3SGxuOVdWcF9LSDN0SmdBVm5yUE9PTDNlMThCSXpuTHhUbDktcjRlTGxEelpwZ2lBbXdUdzc3LXBRZ18tcG4tdVpiTXlxaGk5dGI4MjNTUHVrck1pWFFPM1NxRW9IMEZXREJBV2R6eWtlYUhTVmZ6NjhVaUNDVi1kS0VLc0dpemlTTDZSSVFn</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，这些严重的疾病现在比心脏病发作更致命- AOL.com | Scientists Say These Serious Conditions Are Now Bigger Killers Than Heart Attacks - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart attack-related deaths are down by nearly 90% since 1970, according to a new study.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, other heart disease-related deaths are on the rise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We asked experts to explain the findings and how to prevent heart health issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published by the American Heart Association (AHA) measured heart disease-related deaths over nearly 50 years, and while the results showed heart attack-related deaths were down 90%, other heart conditions are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventative cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods; &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute; &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that heart attack-related deaths decreased by almost 90% between 1970 and 2022. Specifically, heart disease accounted for 41% of deaths in 1970, and as of 2022, that number declined to 24% of all deaths. That’s the good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, deaths from heart failure, arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), and hypertensive (high blood pressure-related) heart disease have increased by 146%, 106%, and 450%, respectively. In 1970, less than 9% of deaths were from those abnormalities. Essentially, the common cause of heart disease-related death has moved from “out of the blue” ischemic events like heart attacks to long-term, slow-burning heart conditions that do damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked cardiologists what the findings mean, how the statistics could continue to change over the next half-century, and most importantly, how we, as a population, can continue to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63189227/cardiologist-recommended-heart-health-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the numbers change?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early intervention, medication, and public awareness of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a25455684/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women-viral-tweet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack symptoms&lt;/a&gt; have advanced greatly and contributed to the major decrease in heart attack deaths. “We are now saving people who would have died in the past. That’s great progress,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods. She adds that heart attack survivors are seeking help more quickly and receiving life-saving treatment such as stents and cholesterol-controlling medications like statins. Smoking cessation has also contributed to the numbers, adds &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute. “These gains show that when we invest in prevention, education, and access to care, we can make a real difference,” concludes &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Klodas stresses that “we’ve only kicked the can down the road,” because long-term, post-cardiac event lifestyle changes that prevent chronic disease and risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, are lacking—diet being a huge one. “95% of Americans don’t get enough fiber, 90% take in more sodium than is recommended, the majority of U.S. adults consume less than one serving of fruit or vegetables per day,” she explains. “How can we expect our engines (hearts) to function properly if we’re constantly pouring in the wrong fuel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Setareh adds that heart disease risk factors like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are more prevalent now than ever. As people live longer, age-related cardiac conditions like heart failure and arrhythmias become more common. Lastly, improved diagnoses and tracking may also be capturing more deaths overall, he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain a healthy heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the experts we spoke to have heart-healthy recommendations that are simple and align with those established by the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AHA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a balanced whole foods and plant-forward diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit saturated fats from processed foods and things like butter, cheese, and marbled meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t smoke (including vaping).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get regular physicals and bloodwork to remain aware of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar, all of which can change without you knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study underscores that cardiovascular disease is not a single enemy, it’s a moving target,” says Dr. Setareh. “Our strategies must evolve just as the disease burden does. It’s not just about surviving a heart attack anymore. It’s about preventing the chronic heart conditions that follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hoff agrees. “After treating a patient for a heart attack, there is often a sense of joy and relief among the patient and their family. It feels like a crisis has been averted, and in many ways, it has. But I often tell them that this is not the finish line,” he explains. “It is the starting point for a new phase of life that requires consistent attention to risk factors, medications, lifestyle changes, and follow-up care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:42:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg</guid></item><item><title>更高的抗胆碱能使用与更快的行动能力和力量下降相关- Medical Xpress | Higher anticholinergic use linked to faster decline in mobility and strength - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNNk9Hb0hWNVROckJNNGQyNFIzUExfQTlzeVBNelpYTWFic1hpWGJxSmtYVlphQWVmSmVqQ2RfdnF6ZVY3cEhReldoZkNzdkZieGt1azRXdVczaXdEdjh4UjNqMTNqWVV0ejlEN2luVDliQU5SMm1ZNzY4U3FrVHV6d0lSbnQwOUtwSDBYVWFZaWV5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente Washington scientists report that higher cumulative anticholinergic exposure predicted a faster decline in gait speed and grip strength among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Older adults frequently receive prescriptions for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anticholinergic+medications/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anticholinergic medications&lt;/a&gt; that interfere with acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for memory and muscle activation, leading to cognitive fog, confusion, and falls. Prescribing patterns are slowly shifting in response to warnings about these declines, but &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/long-term+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;long-term use&lt;/a&gt; is still common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have reported possible associations between anticholinergic use and slower gait speed or weaker grip strength with a pooled effect that appears small and not clinically meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Cumulative Anticholinergic Exposure and Change in Gait Speed and Grip Strength in Older Adults," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836242" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used a cohort study design to assess whether cumulative anticholinergic exposure has any associated effect on annual rates of decline in gait speed and grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 4,283 participants enrolled in the Adult Changes in Thought study at Kaiser Permanente Washington between 1994 and 2020. Eligibility required at least 10 years of continuous health plan enrollment and a minimum of two study visits with gait speed or grip strength measurements. The mean ages were 74.3–74.5 years and 58.5–58.6% of the participants were women, across outcome samples.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic exposure was estimated through pharmacy dispensing records and quantified as total standardized daily dose over 10 years and mean standardized daily dose over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted cumulative exposure models allowed two, four, six, eight, or 10-year assessment windows to account for time-varying effects. Gait speed and grip strength were assessed during biennial visits by standardized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-year weighted cumulative exposure provided the best statistical fit among models tested and indicated a decline of -0.0034 m/s per year per 1-unit increase in weighted mean standardized daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant associations appeared between conventional exposure measures and grip strength. Six-year weighted cumulative exposure did show a significant decline in grip strength (-0.0329 kg per year per 1-unit increase in weighted mean standardized daily dose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that higher cumulative anticholinergic use was associated with greater decline rates of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gait+speed/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gait speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/grip+strength/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; beyond aging and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors warn that accumulation of small losses can become clinically meaningful over time and recommend that clinicians avoid anticholinergics when possible, prescribe the lowest effective dose, and periodically reevaluate patients to identify deprescribing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
