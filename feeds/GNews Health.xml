is anything but rare, turning up in one in three people as a single copy and in roughly one in 36 as a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H63D does not usually overload the liver the way the better‑known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC165699/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C282Y variant&lt;/a&gt; can, but laboratory work shows that mutant HFE can upset cellular iron sensors and let free iron trigger damaging chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-iron-brains-and-memory"&gt;Genes, iron, brains and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is vital but volatile, and when it piles up inside microglia, the brain’s immune cells, it sparks oxidative stress and inflammation tied to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of animal and human data echo the theme: iron dyshomeostasis fans reactive oxygen species, injures neurons, and may even set off ferroptosis, a specialized form of cell death linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE variants have also been linked to Parkinson’s disease and motor neuron disorders, suggesting that iron mismanagement may be a shared pathway across multiple brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8661115/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that abnormal iron levels in regions like the substantia nigra and motor cortex are associated with earlier onset and faster progression of these diseases in genetically susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-aspree-data-revealed"&gt;What the ASPREE data revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspree.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The ASPREE trial&lt;/a&gt; followed 19,114 healthy seniors for a median 6.4 years to test low‑dose aspirin, generating a gold‑mine of aging data in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome scans within ASPREE showed that men with two H63D copies logged an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.39 for incident &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while women with the same genotype saw no extra risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,” &lt;a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/john-olynyk-6669ecca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor John Olynyk&lt;/a&gt;, of Curtin University Medical School, who co‑led the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-only-men"&gt;Why only men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/girls-diets-strongly-influence-when-they-begin-puberty/"&gt;Menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, pregnancy, and lower mid‑life ferritin give women a natural outlet for iron, which may blunt the variant’s impact; haemochromatosis complications likewise appear later and milder in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑imaging studies find that women who stop menstrual bleeding early accumulate more iron in deep brain regions, hinting that lifelong iron exposure could be the pivot that tips male brains toward damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex hormones complicate matters too, because &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; modulates iron metabolism and offers anti‑inflammatory benefits that may shield neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE analysis is already part of routine work‑ups when doctors suspect iron overload, but the new results suggest that broader screening in aging men could flag a hidden &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; risk before symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying carriers is inexpensive, and unlike many predictive markers, this one points to an actionable pathway, iron handling and its downstream inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-steps-today"&gt;Practical steps today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found no clear link between blood ferritin levels and dementia, yet keeping iron in the normal range, treating chronic inflammation, staying active, and eating a plant‑biased diet all intersect with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity alone can slash dementia risk by roughly 30 percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also emphasize blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and social engagement, interventions that help every older adult, variant carrier or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; prevention efforts often rely on broad lifestyle advice or age thresholds, but this variant suggests a need for sex‑aware screening policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If men with double H63D copies truly carry double the risk, early genetic testing could steer them toward more aggressive prevention long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-dementia-and-the-future"&gt;Men, dementia, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/paul-lacaze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Paul Lacaze&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt;, hopes that untangling how H63D alters brain pathways will spark medicines that block the harm even when the gene cannot be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will track variant carriers with MRI iron mapping and fluid biomarkers to catch early inflammatory changes, then test whether diet, phlebotomy, or anti‑ferroptotic drugs can tilt the balance back toward healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics rarely hands scientists such a common, sex‑specific clue, and this one arrives in time for a generation of men now crossing the 70‑year threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

The biodegradable injectable maintains consistent drug levels, reducing the need for multiple daily pills and improving patient adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the gel released over 90% of the levodopa and 81% of the carbidopa within seven days, with minimal toxicity and easy administration.

This weekly injection could be a game-changer for Parkinson’s care,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson’s, but its short life span means it must be taken several times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA PhD student Deepa Nakmode says the in-situ implant is designed to release both levodopa and carbidopa steadily over one week, maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing the risks associated with fluctuating drug concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After years of focused research, it’s incredibly rewarding to see our innovation in long-acting injectables for Parkinson’s disease reach this stage. Our invention has now been filed for an Australian patent,” Nakmode says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injectable gel combines an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer PLGA with Eudragit L-100, a pH-sensitive polymer, to achieve a controlled and sustained drug release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive lab tests confirmed the system’s effectiveness and safety:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 90% of the levodopa dose and more than 81% of the carbidopa dose was released over seven days.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The implant degraded by over 80% within a week and showed no significant toxicity in cell viability tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formulation can be easily administered through a fine 22-gauge needle, minimising discomfort and eliminating the need for surgical implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of this research are profound,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By reducing the frequency of dosing from multiple times a day to a weekly injection is a major step forward in Parkinson’s therapy. We’re not just improving how the drug is delivered; we’re improving patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Garg says the technology could also be adapted for other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, pain management, and chronic infections that require long-term drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can be tuned to release drugs over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks depending on therapeutic needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA scientists hope to start clinical trials in the near future and are exploring commercialisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83e0e2ede7faade4eae1f0ecedc3f6edeaf0e2ade6e7f6ade2f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Candy Gibson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Candy Gibson – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13346-025-01892-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sanjay Garg et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-acting injectables have gained attraction as a system for treating chronic conditions due to their increased efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. Currently, patients with Parkinsons need to administer oral medications multiple times a day which imposes the significant risk of non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to design an in-situ implant-forming system for controlled delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for up to 1 week which will reduce the need for multiple dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA &lt;sub&gt;50:50&lt;/sub&gt;) and Eudragit L-100 was used to prepare the implants and the formulation was optimized to achieve a controlled release over 7 days. The optimized formulation containing 26% PLGA and 6% Eudragit L 100 displayed a favorable release profile and injectability with low viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimized formulation in vitro release study revealed an initial burst of 34.17% and 37.16% for levodopa and carbidopa in the first 24 h and about 92% and 81% release within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good correlation was observed between the in-vitro drug release data and ex-vivo drug release with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 for levodopa and 0.90 for carbidopa. Viscosity analysis showed the Newtonian behavior of the formulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringeability analysis of the formulation showed that the maximum force required for expelling the formulation was 32.98 ± 0.72 N using a 22 G needle. The in-vitro degradation studies revealed 81.89% weight loss of implant in 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prepared formulation was assessed for in-vivo performance using a convolution modeling technique using a convolve function in R software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predicted AUC 0-∞ h for the in-situ forming implant was 26505.5 ng/ml with Cmax, 399.3 ng/ml, and Tmax 24 h assuming 100% bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results justify that the prepared in-situ implant forming system can be a promising system for the delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:10:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5DNFB4UzV4eUdHb2tFWEk4Q0dvek8yVUI5bHBxVGVEY1JJS0k0OS1tNzM4QUd6aXNrMllrQ0dYX1kzT1BRLUVKVWYxbm5mVGpTQXRZYmNHWWFISHRsU0NXT3BzeThFbXpNbHdKUnZER3dOa1ZT</guid></item><item><title>需要多少阳光才能获得足够的维生素D ？ - WKBN.com | How much sun is needed to get enough vitamin D? - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGtyWGhTUmtJSFFrd21Oa0N1dlo5bFhIUXRidm1sUVR3UGNNWUpUMm5hN1ZCRFg2OFJuOU5VT1RVMEhOdURKQTE0UFI4cDgxQXozVnk4RnVJd0lSc3ZrR2F5VVAyZExEdzN5RkhQajNraGdaY2E2ZkYyYVNCNXJQWnNQMWhMSm50aW5hdtIBkgFBVV95cUxPSmdSTVlybVo5MThqeHlGS05idU9Nd3ZsV3BnN2ktQnJMdkpNb05QS0RNVjRud1hqWUdSY2swOHEtb3poQjAzRXpUd1FtTThCMDdvd09uTElLVDNVc1p1bVp6NW9JdERxR2RuYURQQUlOeHp3Z2x6aGlfcTF0M1V5bW5iS1o4RENjVUdOTUN4cnNtQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;(WKBN) – Now that it’s summertime, more people are spending time in the sun to get vitamin D — and doctors say that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is important for bone and cardiovascular health, as well as for the immune system and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You only need a few minutes of sun exposure several times a week. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-sunshine-you-need-daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure each day is enough for vitamin D production, and can also boost your mood and improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some foods have vitamin D, it’s usually not enough. The sun is the best source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplements are also available but you should talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep in mind that if you are taking vitamin D through a supplement, that it may interact with some of the medications that you may also be taking for other conditions. For instance, certain cholesterol medications, certain blood pressure medications and certain heart medications may actually interact with vitamin D. So check with your doctor to make sure that you’re not taking anything that could potentially be hurting you,” said Dr. Neha Vyas, with the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She says to remember to wear sunscreen when you’re out in the sun — it won’t stop you from getting vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116574" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that stress related to election news and the buildup before the election was linked to higher risks of depression and anxiety among young adults. Interestingly, stress about the election results themselves was not tied to increased mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to examine how different aspects of election-related stress affect mental health among young adults in the United States. Presidential elections are among the most high-profile events in American civic life, and in recent years they have become increasingly stressful for many people. Past studies have shown a rise in stress levels during election seasons, but few have looked closely at how specific kinds of election-related stress might relate to clinical symptoms of depression or anxiety. This study was designed to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 presidential race was particularly intense. It came after years of political turmoil and was marked by widespread concerns about threats to democracy, fears of election-related violence, and deep divisions in public opinion. Many Americans reported feeling overwhelmed or anxious during the election period. For young adults, who are still developing emotionally and often face financial and social instability, this kind of stress can be especially hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how election stress affects young people’s mental health, researchers used data from the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES), a long-running survey of young adults in the United States. This study followed participants from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic into early 2025. The current analysis focused on a group of 778 people who completed surveys both in 2022 and in the months following the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at three kinds of election-related stress: distress in the lead-up to the election, distress caused by the election outcome, and distress from news coverage related to the election. They used standard screening tools to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, looking specifically for signs that participants might be at risk for at least moderate levels of these conditions. They also accounted for a wide range of background factors, such as participants’ political views, education level, employment status, race, gender identity, and sexual orientation, as well as prior mental health history, financial distress, and emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that stress from election-related news was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Young adults who felt more distressed by the news around the time of the election were more likely to score above the clinical threshold for moderate depression and anxiety symptoms. Stress in the weeks and months before the election—the anticipation phase—was also linked to increased depression symptoms, but it was not tied to anxiety symptoms. Surprisingly, stress related to the actual results of the election did not predict symptoms of either depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that some groups were more vulnerable than others. Participants who identified as part of gender or sexual minority groups were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Financial stress was also a strong predictor of both depression and anxiety. Having symptoms of depression or anxiety in 2022 was a powerful predictor of whether someone would still meet the threshold for those conditions in 2025. These patterns suggest that both existing mental health challenges and ongoing life stressors continue to shape how young adults respond to political stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that stress from constant exposure to news—especially on social media—may play a major role in shaping young adults’ emotional responses to elections. Because young people are more likely to get their news online, they may be more affected by the constant stream of political content. Even those who try to avoid politics may struggle to tune it out. This constant exposure may lead to feelings of helplessness, fear, or hopelessness, all of which are associated with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News about the 2024 election may have been especially distressing for this sample, which was predominantly made up of liberal-identifying women and individuals from gender or sexual minority groups. Many of the key issues covered in election news—such as reproductive rights and transgender healthcare—directly affect these groups. As a result, these participants may have felt personally threatened by some of the policies or rhetoric they saw in the news. This could help explain why news-related stress had such a strong link to mental health symptoms in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory stress, or stress experienced in the lead-up to the election, was also linked to a higher risk of depression. This kind of stress may have contributed to depressive symptoms by fueling negative thoughts, emotional fatigue, or feelings of powerlessness. In contrast, it did not appear to increase anxiety. The researchers speculate that this may be because many participants in the study were already bracing themselves for an outcome they viewed as likely, which may have led to sadness and withdrawal rather than fear or panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, stress about the election result itself—whether participants were upset about who won or lost—was not linked to an increased risk of either depression or anxiety. This finding runs counter to the assumption that disappointment or outrage over the outcome is the most emotionally damaging part of the election. Instead, it suggests that the stress leading up to the vote, and the non-stop news coverage surrounding it, may be more harmful than the result itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out some limitations in their study. For instance, the measures of election-related stress were based on single questions, which might not capture all the nuances of how people experience stress. Because some of the stress questions were asked after the election, it’s possible that participants’ answers were influenced by the results. But the study’s design controlled for many background factors, which helps strengthen the reliability of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that mental health professionals may need to pay closer attention to the emotional toll of election periods, particularly among young adults. For people who are already experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, the months leading up to an election may be a time of increased vulnerability. Clinicians might consider helping patients manage their media consumption, use cognitive behavioral techniques to address unhelpful thought patterns, or practice mindfulness to reduce anticipatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers call for more real-time studies to understand how people react emotionally during political events. Future work could also examine whether similar patterns appear among politically conservative or moderate young adults, or how different types of news content affect stress levels.

&lt;p&gt;Fiber supports healthy digestion, helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and promotes a sense of fullness that can aid in appetite and weight management. It’s also linked to a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, including colorectal and colon, Zenker noted. “Low fiber diets are linked to microbiome imbalances and lower microbial diversity, both of which are associated with increased risk of inflammatory diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different types of fiber offer different benefits. “Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol — great for patients with diabetes or heart disease risk,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bespokeconciergemd.com/providers/dr-michael-ednie" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7907052" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Ednie&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Bespoke Concierge MD based in Scottsdale, Arizona. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. “Insoluble fiber promotes regularity and helps prevent constipation, which is crucial for colon health,” Ednie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s prebiotic fiber, which serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut. “As those bacteria ferment prebiotic fibers, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory effects and support gut barrier function. Prebiotics have also been linked to improved mineral absorption and even mood regulation via the gut-brain connection,” Ednie said. Garlic, onions, bananas and asparagus are all excellent sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like variety in your overall diet supports better nutrition, eating different types of fiber helps build a healthier, more resilient gut microbiome. “Different fibers feed different strains of beneficial bacteria, which leads to better gut health, stronger immune function and lower inflammation overall,” Ednie explained. While there’s no strict formula for how much of each fiber type you need, he suggests aiming for about two-thirds insoluble fiber and one-third soluble fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing can backfire on your digestive system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — They face different symptoms of Long COVID, but they all share one common experience — finding answers at a clinic run by Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three years, Emily, 34, from St. Louis, said she suffered with crushing fatigue, nausea, a racing heart rate and difficulty breathing after getting COVID-19 in August 2020. Her first appointment with a nurse at the Care and Recovery After COVID-19 (CARE) Clinic was life changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said everything I was describing was in line with the experiences of other patients and consistent with what we know about Long COVID,” Emily said. “After three years, I could name my condition definitively, and a health care professional wasn’t afraid to take my suffering seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WashU clinic opened in October 2020 — about seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic — and &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_abfd9080-8434-5253-9dba-ae8d50e1659e.html" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of patients have since come through its doors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now those patients are facing confusion and distress after being told the clinic would  be closing at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several interviewed by the Post-Dispatch say they’ve been given vague reasons as to why. Their future appointments have been canceled, and they are unsure how their care will be coordinated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients only wanted to be identified by their first names because of stigma associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am terrified to lose access to the only doctors who not only believed but understood me,” said Jess, 36, of St. Louis. “I’ve come so far in my progress, and I am scared to lose everything I’ve worked so hard for without the support of Long COVID-competent providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/victoria-j-fraser" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Victoria Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the university’s Department of Medicine, said plans to close the clinic were spurred by the abrupt departure of its leading physician, whose spouse got a job in another state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got unfortunately very short notice that she was leaving, so we really didn’t have another physician to take over the practice,” Fraser said in an interview Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is working on a “transition plan,” she said, which may involve replacing the physician and reopening the clinic, or it may not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, university leaders are making sure that patients — many of whom have complex conditions — continue to receive ongoing care from their team of specialists, Fraser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why the transition is not super-simple at this point,” she said. “We’re working with a number of different specialists to figure out how we can care for these patients in the best way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/specialties/infectious-diseases/post-covid-19-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;clinic’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which had informed visitors of the closure and directed patients to ask their primary care physicians for “the appropriate specialist,” was updated Friday to say the university is working on a transition plan for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;We remain fully committed to providing high-quality care and support to individuals living with Long COVID, and we will share additional information with patients as plans for the clinic are finalized&lt;/span&gt;,” it now states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site provides a phone number and email address of a community health worker who can connect callers to medical specialists and support resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients say they are fearful that losing the clinic means losing a knowledgeable resource on the latest Long COVID research, referrals to specialists who have developed expertise in treating Long COVID symptoms and access to participating in clinical trials for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fear they will lose the progress they have made in improving their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma, 38, of St. Louis County, was healthy and lifting weights five days a week before she got COVID-19 in May 2022. She found her way to the CARE Clinic after six months of dealing with extreme fatigue, migraines, nausea, allergic reactions and other symptoms. Until then, providers had only responded to her with shoulder shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the therapeutics and the referrals I’ve gotten from the Long COVID clinic, I am just now starting to get something that resemblances a life back,” Emma said. “I can tend my garden. I can play with my nieces. Stairs are still my nemesis, but they don’t knock me down anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also worry about those who get sick in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Losing the CARE Clinic is a devastating blow. It affects current patients who have spent years struggling with daily tasks and also future patients who will need answers, support and treatment,” said Alex, 36, of Jefferson County. “The closure of this clinic makes it feel like help is slipping away when we need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID’s broad reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela, 47, who lives in the Metro East, found herself with debilitating neurological issues, chest pains and gastrointestinal problems after getting COVID in June 2022. A year later, she has lost her 20-year career in the utility industry and become disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her husband working, her two sons have become her caregivers, she said. “It is truly a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to the clinic, however, gave her hope for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt; is a chronic condition that includes a wide range of symptoms that occur after a COVID-19 infection and last at least three months. The symptoms can range from mild to severe — including organ damage and blood clots — and can even result in a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 23 million Americans had symptoms of Long COVID in 2023, &lt;a href="https://covid19community.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/CEAL-WhatYouNeedtoKnowLongCOVID-English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

And about a quarter of adults with the disease report significant limitations in performing daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Long COVID clinics opened across the country at the start of pandemic, but many are now closed, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/long-covid-clinics-closing/682251" target="_blank"&gt;according to an April article published in The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reporter called 171 clinics and found 61 had closed, 15 were unreachable and 11 did not have a medical doctor or nurse on staff. Only 79 were accepting new patients. The closest to St. Louis are in Kansas City and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only clinic in North Carolina — the University of North Carolina COVID Recovery Clinic — closed its doors last month. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/patient-services/services-and-specialties/covid-recovery-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;A press release&lt;/a&gt; blamed “the loss of multiple funding sources,” with officials &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article308422905.html" target="_blank"&gt;offering few details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closures come as Long COVID remains poorly understood and managed. No prescriptions, supplements or over-the-counter medications are approved to prevent or treat Long COVID, and more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each clinic that shuts down, our communities lose not just care but also hope for recovery and a better quality of life,” said Laurie Jones, executive director of the worldwide patient advocacy organization &lt;a href="https://www.meaction.net" target="_blank"&gt;#MEAction&lt;/a&gt;, especially as people continue to get COVID-19. “Shutting down these clinics is not only harmful, it’s dangerously short-sighted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-releases/long-covid-grant-awards.html" target="_blank"&gt;undertook efforts to increase understanding of the disease and improve care&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal spending and crack down on student protests it deems as antisemitic has caused &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/myalgic-encephalomyelitis-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-columbia-program-shutdown" target="_blank"&gt;post-COVID research programs at universities like Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; to take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a “reorganization,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in March &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/trump-administration-shuttering-office-of-long-covid-research-and-practice-00246836" target="_blank"&gt;also shut down&lt;/a&gt; the Long COVID Advisory Committee and the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which helped coordinate Long COVID research across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(25)00094-1/fulltext#:~:text=Millions" target="_blank"&gt;HHS also tried to cancel&lt;/a&gt; a $1.7 billion federal Long COVID research program — &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org" target="_blank"&gt;Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)&lt;/a&gt; — stating it would “no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research program was rescued from the chopping block after pushback from patients and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program recently discovered that &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/recover-research-qa-pediatric-long-covid" target="_blank"&gt;up to 5.8 million American children have Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting it could now be the most common chronic condition among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington University is one of 12 universities participating in the RECOVER research program, which aims to accelerate scientific progress and provide patients with services they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university was awarded a &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/long-covid-clinic-expanding-reach-to-vulnerable-metro-rural-communities" target="_blank"&gt;five-year $4.5 million RECOVER grant in the fall of 2023 to identity patient needs and improve care across Missouri&lt;/a&gt; through efforts such as working with community clinics and the University of Missouri to increase primary care physicians’ knowledge about the disease, especially in underserved and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is &lt;a href="https://stlouisihn.org/our-work/clinical-community-integration/long-covid-care" target="_blank"&gt;also participating in studies&lt;/a&gt; testing medications to improve symptoms such as fast heart rate, dizziness and fatigue; a rehabilitation program to prevent energy crashes; and a procedure to improve the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;University officials say the research will continue and not be impacted by the clinic’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the university did not disclose the number of patients the clinic has been treating, Fraser mentioned that the figure “has been declining significantly” over time. These slowing numbers have also been seen nationally, she said, as patients’ symptoms gradually improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there still are a number of patients who are suffering, and we understand that and want to best help them however we can,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Terrified of backsliding’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients at the CARE clinic say they have been guided through numerous helpful interventions, including simple things such as compression stockings, not eating certain fruits and vegetables, drinking salt water and taking antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They describe receiving physical therapy plans that understand how their energy can be depleted and send them into a worsening cycle — knowledge that has helped many maintain their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also funneled them to specialists in areas such as cardiology, neurology and orthopedics that became experienced in identifying symptoms and treatment strategies tailored to each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess describes having gone from needing a wheelchair to being able to go on a 20-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily said after her first appointment, she started speech, occupational and physical therapy with practitioners who had built a body of knowledge to support Long COVID patients. She learned skills to help her memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Long COVID clinic was a door to health care professionals who were actively researching, learning and re-tooling effective approaches,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rusti Levin, 72, of St. Louis, said she caught COVID-19 for the first time in February and went to the clinic in May. During a two-hour appointment, she learned lifestyle interventions and was connected to an array of specialists. Now her follow-up appointment at the clinic in November has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what to expect,” Levin said. “I will wait to hear from the different departments to see what is happening with the rest of the Long COVID specialists, and if I can continue to see them in spite of the clinic shutting down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also brought clinical trials to St. Louis, which many patients say they participate in. Now, they fear losing the clinic could also mean losing access to future trials and a local pipeline for innovative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without a dedicated Long COVID clinic, what incentive will there be for large research studies like RECOVER to come here?” Emma asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal   tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-5fe8819e-d814-5c25-8ba3-d97bf8de810b" data-instance="#gallery-items-e834303f-9b13-4bdd-a804-139cd1c6cb1e-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e834303f-9b13-4bdd-a804-139cd1c6cb1e"&gt;

In men, the drug’s effects appeared to be related to the structural integrity of neural fibers in the forceps major region of the corpus callosum. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811925001995?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;em data-start="450" data-end="462"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="465" data-end="886"&gt;Impulsivity refers to the tendency to act quickly without fully considering the consequences, often leading to risky or inappropriate behavior. It is a common feature of both everyday behavior and clinical conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, and certain mood disorders. Impulsivity is a complex trait that can affect decision-making, emotion regulation, and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="888" data-end="1390"&gt;There are several types of impulsivity. Motor impulsivity involves acting without thinking, such as blurting out answers or interrupting others. Attentional impulsivity is characterized by difficulty staying focused and being easily distracted. Choice impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed ones, reflecting difficulty with delaying gratification. Cognitive impulsivity involves making decisions quickly without adequately processing available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1392" data-end="1942"&gt;Study author Maryana Daood and her colleagues aimed to assess whether methylphenidate affects choice impulsivity. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can improve attention and self-control. It is sold under brand names such as Ritalin, Concerta, and Medikinet. Since impulsivity is a central feature of ADHD, verifying that a commonly used treatment reduces this specific behavior has important implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1944" data-end="2136"&gt;The study included 48 young adults recruited through advertisements at the University of Haifa in Israel. The average participant age was between 26 and 27 years, and 28 participants were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2138" data-end="2577"&gt;Each participant took part in two data collection sessions. During each session, they completed structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans—both at rest and while performing a delay discounting task, a measure of choice impulsivity. In one session, participants received a 20 mg oral dose of methylphenidate. In the other session, they received a placebo capsule identical in appearance but without active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2579" data-end="2933"&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received methylphenidate in the first session and placebo in the second; the other group received the treatments in the opposite order. Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatments knew which capsule was taken in each session, making the study double-blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2935" data-end="3206"&gt;In addition to the two experimental sessions, participants completed the delay discounting task on two earlier occasions. This task assesses how much a person devalues a reward based on the time they have to wait for it. It is commonly used to measure choice impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3208" data-end="3724"&gt;Neuroimaging data showed that men had greater white matter integrity in three brain tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation, the cingulum bundle, and the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Methylphenidate significantly reduced choice impulsivity in men but not in women. In men, the drug’s effectiveness was greater among those with lower neural fiber integrity in the forceps major. In contrast, in women, the drug’s impact was more pronounced among those with higher white matter integrity in the forceps minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, results uncover sex-specific effects of MPH [methylphenidate] on choice impulsivity, accounted for by inverse associations between choice impulsivity under MPH and the structural integrity of distinct segments of the corpus callosum,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of methylphenidate on choice impulsivity.

Though adjusting your diet is far from a miracle cure, when paired with other healthy habits, like maintaining your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/summer-hydration-daily-water-requirements/" target="_self"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;, getting enough exercise, getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and managing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-strategies-to-reduce-stress-and-feel-more-joy-today/" target="_self"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, it's a low-effort way to relieve your pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"The most important thing I tell patients is that migraines are highly individualized," says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Church&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified member of the American Board of Family Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians. "What helps one person may not help another, and what's a trigger for one might be therapeutic for someone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church advises patients to keep a "headache diary" to track these factors and see if they notice any triggers. To understand how what you eat can affect your headaches, we talked to dietitians and doctors to determine which foods ease symptoms and which might be contributing to your pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Omega-3-rich foods like walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/health-benefits-omega-3-foods-add-into-diet-with-these-foods/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3-rich&lt;/a&gt; fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines," says Church. "These fish are high in anti-inflammatory fats (EPA and DHA), which can reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the vascular system and brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_self"&gt;2021 randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;, Church explains that because migraines are believed to involve inflammatory and vascular changes in the body, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-omega-3-supplements-for-a-healthy-heart/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce their frequency or intensity when eaten regularly. "The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions like inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish also contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/feel-low-on-energy-try-these-11-vitamin-d-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins like riboflavin, which support healthy brain metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" target="_self"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323014503#sec5" target="_self"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealing that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of migraines. She adds that plant-based sources include chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia and flax seeds are great sources of omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;mikroman6/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Magnesium-rich foods like spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uws.edu/faculty/byname/daniel_redwood/" target="_self"&gt;Daniel Redwood&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine at the University of Western States, explains, "Attention to the potential importance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in migraine grew in prominence with the discovery (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2584000/" target="_self"&gt;Ramadan, 1989&lt;/a&gt;) that people with migraines had lower levels of this mineral in their red blood cells, serum and brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Daidone, medical director at &lt;a href="https://trueselfrecovery.com/" target="_self"&gt;True Self Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, seconds this, stating that food rich in magnesium -- like pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado -- may reduce the severity and occurrence of migraines. He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912646/" target="_self"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; examining the potential connection between magnesium deficiency and migraine, which describes how magnesium deficiency is implicated in migraine attacks due to processes like cortical spreading depression, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance and electrolyte imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although clinical evidence of the acute dietary magnesium deficiency as a direct migraine trigger remains limited, scientists are investigating the involvement of intra- and extracellular magnesium levels in migraine pathogenesis," Daidone explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schonze Del Pozo, a board-certified internal medicine physician and medical director at &lt;a href="https://eastsacconcierge.com" target="_self"&gt;East Sacramento Concierge&lt;/a&gt;, states that many of the patients she sees for headaches and migraines are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;deficient in magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. She also cites a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22426836/" target="_self"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Neural Transmission entitled "Why all migraine patients should be treated with magnesium." As a result, she recommends a healthy diet of magnesium-rich dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ginger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many swear by ginger as a way to help with migraines," states &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drknobel/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, a general practitioner and medical director of &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/" target="_self"&gt;Medical Cert UK&lt;/a&gt;. "Studies have proven that ginger reduces nausea and can decrease the inflammation that leads to migraine pain. Ginger has helped patients during my practice, whether they take it as ginger tea or in supplement form." She references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/" target="_self"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; that found ginger powder to be as effective as the medication sumatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks, but with fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea may be especially beneficial because, Knöbel states, "It's important to drink enough water, as well as eat ginger. Drinking enough water might stop your migraine from getting any worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/dont-miss-out-on-the-7-hidden-health-benefits-of-ginger/" target="_self"&gt;ginger because it contains&lt;/a&gt; natural anti-inflammatory compounds like gingerol. "I've had patients find relief from migraines or migraine-related nausea using ginger tea, powder or chews," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%222019%20study%22}" target="_self"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; also found that 400mg of ginger extract, in addition to 100mg of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, may help treat migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea combines the benefits of ginger with the hydration of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Muhamad Zulkarnaen/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Nuts and seeds like pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another group of foods I recommend are nuts and seeds, including almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts," Church states. "Like leafy greens, these are rich in magnesium, and some also provide &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-e-health-benefits-nutritional-sources-and-drawbacks/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, which has been shown to help with menstrual migraines and migraines with aura." A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4359851/#sec3" target="_self"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; reflected this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cinnamon contains a high amount of antioxidants that may also reduce headache frequency," Campbell explains. "Stir it into your morning oatmeal or tea, or bake it into muffins and breads." She cites a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638445/" target="_self"&gt;2020 trial&lt;/a&gt;, stating, "Studies suggest that cinnamon supplementation may lower inflammation, cutting down on migraine frequency, severity and duration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants in cinnamon may help treat headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Foods rich in vitamin B2, like eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-known [1998] &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/wnl.50.2.466?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_self"&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that 400 mg of riboflavin daily significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity over a three-month period," Church says. Though this high dose usually comes from supplementation, riboflavin-rich foods support the same metabolic processes in migraine prevention. These foods can include eggs, dairy and lean meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Riboflavin is essential for mitochondrial energy production, and many researchers believe that migraines stem in part from dysfunction in energy metabolism within brain cells," Church adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redwood adds, "There exists a small but promising body of research on the effectiveness of some nutritional supplements for migraines, especially riboflavin (vitamin B2), coenzyme Q10 and magnesium. The first research-based indicator of riboflavin's potential as a migraine treatment appeared in a small 1946 article by a medical physician, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which reported dramatic effectiveness from what would now be considered low-dose B2 supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779525/" target="_self"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analysis found that supplementation of 400mg/day of vitamin B2 for three months affected the duration, frequency and pain score of migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs, dairy and lean meats &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Turmeric &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric and, according to Campbell, is "high in antioxidant power and shines especially when paired with omega-3s." To add it to your diet, consider sprinkling it into smoothies, curries or teas. Campbell references a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32727335/" target="_self"&gt;2021 trial&lt;/a&gt; that concluded, "Present findings revealed that n-3 fatty acids and curcumin co-supplementation can be suggested as a promising new approach in migraine headache management." However, more studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with omega-3s, turmeric may help with migraine headache management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Rawlstock/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Whole grains like brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church mentions that whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and oats may also be beneficial since they "provide a steady release of glucose, preventing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;blood sugar crashes&lt;/a&gt; that can trigger headaches, and are good sources of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins and trace minerals." He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846638/#abstract1" target="_self"&gt;2023 cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt; of 12,710 participants with all data collected from a 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It found that for every 10 grams of fiber added to the diet, there was an 11% reduction in the odds of having severe headaches or migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By providing magnesium, iron, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/8-science-backed-reasons-you-should-take-vitamin-b/" target="_self"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains support brain health, oxygen delivery and a stable glucose supply, which are all relevant to migraine prevention," concludes Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216708/" target="_self"&gt;2023 comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt; also found that curcumin is a promising candidate for preventing and controlling migraines due to its anti‑inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-protein aggregate and analgesic effects. However, additional studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; quinoa, brown rice and oats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Water-rich foods like watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drkimberlyidoko/?hl=en" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Kimberly Idoko&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental neurobiologist and board-certified neurologist, reveals that dehydration can also trigger headaches, which is why staying hydrated can significantly improve migraine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/eat-your-way-to-peak-hydration-with-these-6-electrolyte-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;Water-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumber, watermelon and citrus fruits also help you stay hydrated," adds Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent dehydration-caused headaches or migraines, enjoy more water-rich foods like watermelon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anucha Muphasa/500px/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods that may trigger headaches or migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate, cheese and alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; "In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403039/" target="_self"&gt;[2007] study&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 migraine sufferers, 44% reported at least one food as a trigger.

Over a 5-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week," says Redwood. "At the end of a gradual withdrawal period (because too speedy a withdrawal can trigger even worse headaches), 33 of these 36 young people were headache-free, a truly stunning result. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine (&lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00414.x" target="_self"&gt;Chou and Bell, 2007&lt;/a&gt;)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: 11 quarts of cola per week is extreme, and the average person doesn't consume this much caffeine. Moderate caffeine intake is still OK, according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City who is also part of CNET's medical review board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to caffeine, Church notes, "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/cutting-back-on-coffee-is-hard-tips-for-making-it-easier/" target="_self"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, used strategically, can enhance the absorption of pain relievers and constrict dilated blood vessels in the brain, which may ease migraine pain. This is why many over-the-counter headache medications include it. Studies have shown that 40–100 mg of caffeine (the amount in a small cup of coffee or strong tea) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5655397/#:~:text=This%20review%20provides%20evidence%20for,mg%20enhance%20benefits%20in%20migraine." target="_self"&gt;can reduce migraine&lt;/a&gt; or tension headache pain.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating early in the day and front-loading your calories supports greater weight loss versus eating later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts suggest eating breakfast at least 12 hours after your last meal for the most benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is linked to better diet quality, cognitive benefits and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And experts agree that, in most cases, some breakfast is better than no breakfast. That’s because skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of obesity, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But does it matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we eat breakfast? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826585/best-times-to-eat-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal timing is important&lt;/a&gt;, especially for weight loss. “Studies show that front-loading calories earlier in the day supports greater weight loss, even under the same daily calorie intake,” says &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-fencl-rd-cd-35a6251b2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lindsay Fencl, RD, CD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what dietitians have to say about the best time to eat breakfast, why eating earlier might be better and the many other benefits of breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-is-the-best-time-to-eat-breakfast-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why This Is the Best Time to Eat Breakfast for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating earlier in the day aligns naturally with your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s internal clock, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, hormone release and metabolism. In other words, our bodies are more efficient earlier in the day, when it comes to digesting food and burning calories, as compared to the latter part of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It makes sense when you think about it: Food provides fuel, and you need that energy when you’re awake during the day versus when you’re sleeping at night. In fact, studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891068/best-worst-late-night-snacks-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;late-night eating&lt;/a&gt; is associated with weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when should we eat breakfast? “There is not an exact time that is best to have breakfast, as this may depend on the person and their typical schedule,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “However, it’s clear that eating something matters, as research suggests a connection to eating earlier and greater weight loss.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mitri does suggest waiting to eat breakfast until at least 12 hours after your previous meal as a good starting point, due to the metabolic benefits of an overnight fast. “For example, if you ate dinner at 7 p.m., then your breakfast would be at 7 a.m. or later,” explains Mitri.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one study that found a sweet spot when it comes to specific breakfast timing and weight loss. Results of the study showed that eating breakfast between 6:45 and 7:30 a.m. led to more weight loss over 12 weeks versus eating breakfast between 8:10 and 9:10 a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Caveat: This was one study. More research needs to be done to validate these findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-benefits-of-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Benefits of Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Near- and Long-Term Brain Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast could protect your brain from age-related cognitive decline. A recent study provided cognitive tests to more than 850 adults every 18 months. The researchers also looked for signs of neurodegeneration. The results showed that breakfast skippers did not perform as well on the cognitive tests compared to those who ate breakfast. Those who skipped the first meal of the day were also at greater risk of experiencing cognitive decline and signs of neurodegeneration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A quality breakfast, ideally consumed within two to three hours of waking, is linked to a wide range of health benefits, including better mood, improved cognitive function, smarter food choices and more effective weight management,” says Fencl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Increases Diet Quality &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast may lead to eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher-quality diet&lt;/a&gt; overall. Research shows that skipping breakfast led to a two-point decrease in Healthy Eating Index Scores. Missing the first meal of the day lowered scores in the fruit, whole grain, dairy and empty calories categories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Risk of Cardiovascular Disease &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A quality breakfast can also do your heart some good. A clinical trial found that subjects who consumed 20% to 30% of their total calories at breakfast had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines, along with a 9% to 18% reduction in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035440/what-causes-high-triglycerides/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;triglyceride levels&lt;/a&gt; and a 4% to 8% increase in HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-managing-your-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Managing Your Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to eating a balanced breakfast early in the day, and at least 12 hours after your last meal, follow these other habits for successful weight management. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced lunch and dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;At most lunches and dinners, aim to follow the balanced plate framework, making half your plate vegetables, a quarter of your plate whole grains and a quarter of your plate protein. This helps keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mostly whole foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Choose whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and legumes. These foods not only pack protein and fiber to keep you full, but also provide important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that keep inflammation at bay. Consume refined sugars in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your steps in. &lt;/strong&gt;Walking is one of the most underrated forms of exercise for weight loss. Research shows that walking for 50 minutes, just four times a week (at moderate to vigorous intensity) can help with weight loss and losing fat in the belly region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift weights. &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training helps build and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-maintain-muscle-mass-while-losing-weight-8706542" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preserve lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;. When you lose weight, you lose both fat and muscle, unless you’re doing something to preserve that muscle mass. Less muscle means a slower metabolism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get seven to nine hours of good-quality sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Sleep is just as important as diet and exercise when it comes to weight loss. Research shows that just one night of sleep deprivation decreases leptin, the satiety hormone, and increases ghrelin, the hunger hormone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This may lead to more snacking the next day, specifically on foods higher in fat and carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Stress leads to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;elevated cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the stress hormone. The carbs you crave when you’re stressed? It’s biological. Cortisol increases cravings for sugary and fatty foods. Elevated cortisol is also associated with an increase in belly fat. Practicing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-to-lose-weight-11739943" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;mindfulness techniques&lt;/a&gt;, meditation and exercise can all help reduce stress, which can impact weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast early in the day aligns with your circadian rhythm. Your body is more efficient in the first part of the day at digesting food and burning calories compared to the latter. When it comes to timing, experts suggest waiting at least 12 hours after your last meal. Eating breakfast is also associated with a better-quality diet, short- and long-term cognitive benefits and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;

With every drug having some types of side effects, the ones produced by taking this one include dizziness, drowsiness, headaches and nausea. While these might be more adaptable side effects that can be dealt with easily, a new study has revealed one side effect of the consumption of gabapentin that has more long-term effects than ever known before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case Western University in Cleveland performed a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-07-nerve-pain-drug-gabapentin-linked.html#google_vignette" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to find that gabapentin can significantly increase the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in people consuming it for lower chronic back pain. “Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence,” wrote the study authors in the study published in the journal Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does gabapentin really increase the risk of dementia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

These people were 85% more likely to be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment within 10 years of back pain diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dementia typically affects older adults over the age of 65, due to the consumption of gabapentin, the risk of dementia more than doubled among people between the ages of 35-49. Additionally, the risk of mild cognitive impairment more than tripled. Similar effects were seen in people between 50-64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the frequency of use was a deciding factor as well.

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US Environmental Protection Agency has found no level of exposure to Pfos or Pfoa, two of the most common Pfas compounds, in drinking water is safe. They have a half-life in human blood of anywhere from two to five years, by most estimates. That means the body expels half the amount of the chemical that is in blood during that period. Depending on blood levels, it can take decades to fully expel Pfas naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though the findings represent the first time gut microbes have been found to remove Pfas, they have been found to alleviate the impacts of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/27/probiotics-plastics-fermented-food-bacteria-stomach-benefit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;, such as microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers didn’t set out to determine if the gut bacteria expelled Pfas specifically, but instead looked at a suite of 42 common food contaminants. No Pfas limits for food exist in the US, but there is broad consensus that it is among the main exposure routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some microbes performed well in expelling Pfas, so the study’s authors zoomed in on those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors introduced nine of a family of bacterial species into the guts of mice to humanize the mouse microbiome – the bacteria rapidly accumulated to absorb Pfas eaten by the mice, and the chemicals were then excreted in feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The bacteria seem to absorb the chemical, then use a “pump” mechanism that pushes toxins from the cells and aids in excretion, the authors wrote. The mechanism by which the chemicals are pulled into the cell is not yet understood, Lindell said, but she suspects there may be a similar pump. These are developed by microbes to expel other contaminants, drugs or antibiotics, Lindell added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The body more efficiently discharges short-chain Pfas through urine because the compounds are generally water-soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the most common and dangerous long chains are Pfoa and Pfna, which the microbes expelled at rates of up to 58% and 74%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lindell and other study leaders have started a company, Cambiotics, that will develop a probiotic based on their findings. They are planning to follow up the research with a human study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, Lindell stressed that the probiotic would not solve the broader Pfas crisis: “This should not be used as an excuse to downplay other sustainable solutions or to not address the bigger Pfas problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNWVh4NXNPVEMxa2xzTWh1cUM4ZlZMeERmLUJZNFVXXzBrdEV5NmlxQ1d3MTRyMGdJbVF4Nlg1Y19QZUR2MUdyWlV3TDVULW1VbDlHdmxscWNha0h4Y0d2Q0RKa0hjMXVmSXJLSTc0T3VMdU4zZVpVcEljYkFibTA5UFBER2dEc2t1X3lhcnV1cFc</guid></item><item><title>这4种常见的食物类型可能会让你闻起来很难闻，专家警告- AOL.com | These 4 common food types could make you smell bad, experts caution -

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammation can increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nutritious diet, exercise and mindfulness may protect against inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy morning habits like yoga or a quiet cup of coffee or tea may help fight inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day on the right foot sets the tone for the rest of your day. So, why not begin by helping your body fight off inflammation? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We hear a lot about the negative effects of inflammation, but it can be helpful to know that not all inflammation is bad. Acute inflammation is a short-lived natural response our body has to injury or illness. That’s a good thing. Chronic inflammation, however, is prolonged and can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce our body’s ability to repair&lt;/a&gt; and heal, leading to increased risk of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, anything you can do to prevent it may keep you healthier in the long run. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These six inflammation-fighting morning habits can get you going.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-drink-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body loses fluids while you sleep, so in the morning, you naturally wake up a touch dehydrated. Starting your day with some water is a good choice for many reasons. Hydration is linked with longevity, reduced risk of chronic illness and general health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If those reasons aren’t enough to start your day with a cup of water, dehydration is tied to higher levels of inflammation in the body. Chronic dehydration may even lead to “inflammageing,” or chronic inflammation that happens as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, starting your day with a glass of water is free. So, this is one anti-inflammatory habit that should be easy to start if you’re not doing it already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-move-your-body-gently"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Move Your Body Gently  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your dog and cat are onto something when they take a big stretch as they roll out of bed in the morning. But getting some gentle morning movement shouldn’t be reserved just for our furry friends. Regular exercise helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your risk for chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As good for you as physical activity is, intense exercise can increase inflammatory markers in the short term. While exercise’s overall benefits outweigh any downsides, starting your day with some gentle movement may be especially beneficial if your goal is reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that moderate and lighter movement is not tied to the same increases in inflammatory markers in the body as intense exercise. That’s where stretching comes in. Its benefits go beyond just feeling good. Studies show that limbering up can help reduce inflammatory markers throughout your body, as well as locally in the tissues you are stretching.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that’s not the only way to gently move your body. A stroll around the block or an easy yoga session works, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-get-some-morning-light"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Get Some Morning Light  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that getting outside in the morning light can help you sleep better at night. That’s because a.m. sunshine helps regulate your body’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-afternoon-habit-to-start-for-better-sleep-11756992" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly influences your sleep-and-wake cycle. This, in turn, helps you wake up more easily in the morning and fall asleep at night. But your circadian rhythm isn’t just about sleep. It is also closely tied to your immune system and to inflammation. Conversely, lack of daylight may send your circadian rhythm into an inflammatory tailspin. One study found that shift workers with misaligned circadian rhythms had higher levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, getting some rays helps your body make vitamin D, which is known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Research has found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D’s ability to help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; may be particularly impactful in reducing the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-eat-some-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Eat Some Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The deep purples, vibrant reds and rich blues that color our favorite berries are indicators of just how loaded these tiny fruits are with antioxidants. In particular, berries are rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phenolic compounds&lt;/a&gt;, like anthocyanins and flavonols, which work to reduce inflammation in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are also delicious. When they’re in season, load up on colorful, fresh berries. When you can’t find fresh berries, frozen berries are just as good for you and often more affordable and convenient. Try them paired with protein-rich strained (Greek-style) yogurt or whir them into a smoothie for a tasty breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-make-time-for-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Make Time for Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is a sneaky trigger for inflammation. Why? When you’re stressed, your body goes into “fight or flight” mode, stimulating the release of stress hormones like cortisol. That may have been helpful back in the days when we had to be ready to outrun a saber-tooth tiger at a moment’s notice. Today, it’s still humming behind the scenes when that surprise 9 a.m. meeting suddenly drops on your calendar. Once in a while, that’s no big deal. Yet, being constantly stressed can also lead to inflammation in your brain and body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help keep stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress-related inflammation&lt;/a&gt; at bay, carve out a little time for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903638/science-backed-ways-to-be-happier-amp-reduce-stress-that-are-easy-and-free/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindfulness exercises&lt;/a&gt; like deep breathing or body scans, or try a morning meditation. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning cup of joe or tea is more than just a nice, calming ritual that kicks off your day with a caffeine boost. Coffee and tea are jammed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation-busting antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. Take green tea, for example. It’s packed with antioxidants, like EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which research has found helps lower inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Black tea is also full of antioxidants shown to calm inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don’t turn your nose up at coffee, especially if that's your morning drink of choice. Coffee contains more polyphenols than green tea, plus other antioxidants that help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning is an ideal opportunity to get a jump start on fighting inflammation. But why stop there? These strategies can help you combat inflammation throughout the day and even at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;While this isn’t necessarily a morning habit, a good night’s sleep is crucial for reducing inflammation. Research has found that inconsistent sleep is tied with raised inflammatory markers, particularly for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Taking the time to wind down at night with a relaxing evening routine may help you get the zzz’s you need to fend off chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active Throughout the Day: &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your body, including fighting off chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, try to move your body regularly throughout the day. Stay moving by taking frequent walk breaks, having a kitchen dance party or getting more structured exercise at any time of day. A good goal is 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, plus two weekly strength-training sessions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;While there are plenty of anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet, there are also some foods to limit. Like added sugars, which have been linked to increased inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No need to stress if you have some sweets occasionally (remember, stress and inflammation go hand in hand). Just do your best to intentionally choose where you are getting sweetness in your diet. That means checking the ingredient list when buying foods like breads, crackers, yogurts and sauces to make sure they don’t contain too much added sugar. And when you do eat sweet foods, choose smaller portions of those that satisfy your sweet tooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

So, why not get started in the morning? Starting your day with a glass of water, a relaxing cup of coffee or tea, a bowl of fresh berries, and some gentle stretching, deep breathing, yoga or an outdoor walk in the sun are all easy—and enjoyable—healthy habits you can add to your morning to keep inflammation at bay. In addition to fighting inflammation, they’ll benefit your overall health in other ways, too. That means they do double duty in keeping your body in tip-top shape. Try adding all, or most, of these to your morning. Then, keep the momentum going throughout the day with plenty of colorful foods, hydrating beverages and regular movement.&lt;br&gt;

In a randomized clinical trial at Stanford University, researchers found that participants with heightened brain reactivity to unconscious threat cues showed marked changes in neural activity after receiving MDMA. These changes included reduced responses in brain regions associated with fear and improved connectivity between areas involved in emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDMA is a psychoactive compound best known as the recreational drug “ecstasy” or “molly,” but recent research has explored its use in treating mental health conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder. It has been shown to reduce defensiveness and enhance emotional openness, which may help people engage more effectively in therapy. While this approach shows promise, not everyone responds in the same way. The new study aimed to better understand the brain mechanisms involved in MDMA’s effects and to determine whether certain individuals might respond more strongly based on their brain activity before treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordpmhw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, focused on a specific brain circuit known as the “negative affect circuit,” which includes the amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. This network helps the brain detect and regulate responses to emotional threats, especially those outside of conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overactivity in this system is common in people with trauma histories and has been linked to poor treatment outcomes. The team hypothesized that MDMA might help normalize this circuit, but that the effect could depend on a person’s baseline level of activity in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were motivated by a central question: Who is most likely to benefit from MDMA-based treatment—and why? MDMA is emerging as a fast-acting treatment for PTSD and is currently seeking FDA approval as part of MDMA-assisted therapy,” said study authors &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/xue-zhang"&gt;Xue Zhang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/leanne-williams"&gt;Leanne Williams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams is the Vincent V.C. Woo Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, where she directs the Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness and the PanLab for Personalized and Translational Neuroscience. She also leads the Precision Medicine Core at the VA Palo Alto’s Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center and is the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3IoQRQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Precision Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Zhang is a research scientist in Williams’ lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While some individuals experience substantial benefits, others show little to no effect—suggesting that MDMA is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” the researchers said. “To understand this heterogeneity, we focused on the brain—specifically, how differences in neural circuit function might predict treatment response. PTSD is known to disrupt brain circuits involved in processing threat, including outside of conscious awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were particularly interested in whether individual variation in this ‘negative affect’ circuit might help identify who is more likely to benefit from MDMA. Our broader goal is to advance precision psychiatry based on personalized neuroscience: matching each person with the treatment most likely to work for them, based on their brain biotype.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 16 adults who had experienced early life trauma and were showing subclinical signs of posttraumatic stress. All participants had previously used MDMA but had not done so within the past six months. They did not meet the criteria for current psychiatric diagnoses. Each person completed four visits: one baseline session, one placebo session, and two sessions involving different doses of MDMA (80 and 120 milligrams), with the order randomized and spaced out over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During each visit, participants underwent functional MRI scans while completing a task designed to measure brain responses to nonconscious emotional threats. This involved briefly showing angry or fearful faces that were masked to prevent conscious recognition. The researchers also gathered behavioral data, such as how participants rated the likability of facial expressions and how quickly they responded to emotion recognition tasks. After each session, participants completed surveys about their emotional state and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before examining the effects of MDMA, the researchers divided participants into two groups based on how reactive their amygdala was to nonconscious threats at the baseline visit. Eight participants showed high activity in this region (the NTNA+ group), while the other eight showed lower activity (the NTNA− group). This split allowed the team to compare how these subgroups responded differently to MDMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants in the NTNA+ group received the higher MDMA dose, their brain activity showed notable changes. The amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate both became less active in response to threat cues. In addition, communication between these regions increased. These patterns suggest a shift toward a more balanced and regulated emotional response. In contrast, participants in the NTNA− group did not show the same neural changes after taking MDMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNA+ group also showed behavioral changes that aligned with the brain data. After taking 120 milligrams of MDMA, they rated angry faces as more likable, suggesting a softening of their automatic negative reactions. Interestingly, while their brain reactivity decreased, these participants reported greater anxiety and less desire to be with others during the MDMA session compared to the NTNA− group. Their written descriptions indicated more introspective and emotionally complex experiences. Meanwhile, the NTNA− group tended to report more pleasant and euphoric effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One striking finding was the consistency of brain circuit and behavioral findings within the negative affect biotype group,” Zhang and Williams told PsyPost. “Individuals with brain circuit hyperactivity also showed a stronger implicit threat bias, indicating that their brain activity disrupted their behavioral reaction time to respond to signals of threat that appeared outside of conscious awareness. This convergence between brain and behavior suggests that implicit behavioral responses might serve as surrogate markers of underlying brain biotypes—potentially allowing for stratification of individuals who are more likely to benefit from MDMA treatment using both behavior and brain-based measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that MDMA may work differently depending on how the brain processes emotional threats before treatment. For people with heightened baseline reactivity, MDMA appears to reduce brain responses linked to fear and increase connectivity in circuits involved in regulation. These effects could create a more open emotional state, potentially improving the effectiveness of therapy when combined with talk-based approaches. The study supports the idea that measuring brain activity could help match people with treatments tailored to their specific neural profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that how the brain responds to threat—especially at a nonconscious level—can shape how someone responds to MDMA,” Zhang and Williams explained. “This supports the idea that treatments should be personalized, not one-size-fits-all, and that each person’s brain biotype really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a neural circuit-based biotype with elevated baseline activity in the negative affect circuit—a brain circuit that includes the amygdala and is involved in automatically detecting and responding to threat. Individuals in this negative affect biotype with high threat reactivity showed significant changes after a single 120 mg dose of MDMA: reduced circuit hyperactivity, more adaptive connectivity, and improved behavioral responses to threat-related cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that this biotype may be especially suited for MDMA-based therapies,” Zhang and Williams said. “More broadly, it highlights how brain circuit function could serve as an objective marker for treatment matching—bringing us closer to precision psychiatry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to note that this was not a clinical trial of MDMA-assisted therapy. Instead, the study examined the effects of MDMA in a controlled setting without therapeutic guidance. While the results are promising, the small sample size and focus on healthy volunteers with subthreshold symptoms limit how broadly the findings can be applied. More research is needed in clinical populations, including people formally diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the focus of &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordpmhw.com/rbrain-mdma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;our current neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt;, led in collaboration with Dr. Trisha Suppes, and embedded in her clinical trial of MDMA-assisted cognitive processing therapy,” the researchers noted. “It will allow us to test whether the brain circuit biotypes we identified in our mechanistic trial can predict treatment response in real-world clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is part of a larger research effort funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to explore how fast-acting treatments like MDMA, ketamine, and psilocybin affect brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What set this MDMA study apart is that it’s the first to use a person’s pre-treatment brain circuit profile—what we call a biotype—to predict their acute response to the intervention,” Zhang and Williams said. “This circuit biotype-guided approach offers a promising way to improve future clinical trials and, ultimately, routine care. It could help stratify likely responders, rule out likely non-responders, minimize side effects, and streamline treatment – all key steps toward safer, more effective, and more accessible mental healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, the researchers hope to build tools that use brain scans to guide personalized treatment decisions. By identifying “biotypes” based on brain activity, clinicians could better determine which interventions are most likely to help specific individuals. This could reduce the burden of trial-and-error approaches that are common in mental health care today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to validate our circuit-based biotype in individuals with PTSD, and we’re actively doing that in our ongoing neuroimaging trial,” Zhang and Williams explained. “Longer term, we aim to accelerate the clinical translation of our tools that use brain imaging to help match each person with the treatment most likely works for them. We also plan to expand the matching of biotypes to additional treatments, and determine which treatments are specific to each biotype. This precision medicine approach could lead to more effective, personalized care—dramatically reducing the burden of trial-and-error treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.7803" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Negative Affect Circuit Subtypes and Neural, Behavioral, and Affective Responses to MDMA: A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was conducted by Xue Zhang, Laura M.

Nearly 20 years ago a team led by Hiroshi Nose and other researchers from Japan published a study that found that middle-aged and older people who did &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank"&gt;high-intensity interval walking&lt;/a&gt; had lower blood pressure, stronger thigh muscles, and better aerobic capacity than walkers the same age who kept a more moderate, continuous pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42U5VIGI6FBGDFNF63DYBEEVQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study, the volunteers did three minutes of fast walking followed by three minutes at a slower pace, for 30 minutes per day at least four days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CQKHFOA2WZBQTOKYZFPOI5N3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group,” said &lt;a href="https://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/institution/ibs/english/department/bsi.html" target="_blank"&gt;Shizue Masuki&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher on the team and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto.

And you might wonder, if fast walking is so great, why not just do that for 30 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AU7FLJTTRNFBPE2TSCUROIC7AA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;IWT seems to be more doable than walking at an intense pace the entire time, said Masuki. Her research team instructed one group of their middle-aged and older subjects to walk continuously at the high intensity level for 30 minutes a day. “However, no one completed the program, and they complained that the program was too boring and too difficult,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6Z23QRH2RFGVPOD3SM3C3CDAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most studies have found about 60 to 90 percent of people can achieve the goals of IWT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QRECCNHPOJDLXFSXYN3SDG5PSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One factor might be the amount of time it takes.

You don’t have to jump into 30-minute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/02/fartlek-interval-training-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;interval sessions&lt;/a&gt; right away. Ali said even 15 minutes twice per day is still beneficial, and you can still try those intervals within that. Work up to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended amount of exercise&lt;/a&gt; for adults in the U.S. — 150 minutes of physical activity each week, for example, by doing 30 minutes at a time, 5 days per week. Adding in two days of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/29/minimum-weight-training-per-week/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-strengthening activity &lt;/a&gt;would help meet the federal guidelines for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KGFTGKTHFA63GY5B2VBLIS77Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As always, talk to your doctor before beginning any new exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CA4FS5PVZJBMROCSB7LO33Y6WM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We shouldn’t take a previously sedentary person and put them in a high-intensity interval training program,” said &lt;a href="https://anchorcincy.com/anchor-our-team/sarah-crawford/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist in Cincinnati. “That’s why practices like mine stay in business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Use unofficial metrics&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI5LXIIU7NG55FRV75VUKIP3GA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the 2007 study, the volunteers aimed to do three minutes of walking at 70% of their peak aerobic capacity or VO2 max, which is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen the body can process, followed by three minutes at 40% of their peak aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3N6GNKO2AZCYFEBKNSIX6G6EDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While some fitness trackers will give you this number, a good rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t really be able to talk for the whole three “fast” minutes in IWT, Crawford said. For the slower interval, she said you should be able to maintain a conversation, but also keep a sweat going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GFBDU7YKFDJ3KTF4UJTGTADG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She sometimes recommends patients choose a landmark, like mailboxes, and walk past the first 10 quickly, then the next 10 more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KAIWS6D5LBATZPNNVRMMASQ2AE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KAIWS6D5LBATZPNNVRMMASQ2AE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Watch for improvements&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZQUOO3UTY5CHDE2XWRGL2RBIXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your heart rate and breathing recovery may improve over time, Crawford said. Pay attention to when you recover enough to do another quick interval, she said. “How long do we stay there [at 70 percent], and how long does it take at the 40 percent threshold to recover enough to go back up into that 70 percent again?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BPRAZTTYJFCDBHPDXCTMPQUBIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Regardless of the type of walking you try, you’re bound to see benefits, said Crawford: “Walking is safe, low impact, easily accessible, getting somebody out in Earth and off a computer, in feedback with trees and plants and animals,” she said. “It has sun exposure, light exposure, and sensory overdrive of being outside. It is, hands down 100 percent the best form of exercise for all human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:16:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOMV9wbjNzNUlqWnd2dTlRTDNNekpSRUVQdXRmWVRlR3FhNTFNem9NY0VwMDRzQWwwOEUyNHQ2WW1WbWVBUnhrOTdBWXQyRDJBTmFDakoycFRLQVNiMGd0WGxqMllOQmVjUnRvN0FmS3JraXFfSzItMUZVZHFRckFGU2N3UjlESXdmZjBySkIzdUpLWjlkWWkyLXJ3</guid></item><item><title>为什么纽约的母亲有这么多剖腹产？ -时代联盟 | Why are mothers in New York having so many C-sections? - Times Union</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdWVmSkF0Y0FVNWE5eEFCWU91cjZ4UTV5UnFVWXpkeTJGZ0ZSbW9WdVNSVjdZMGwxcUZvSDRJcmJ0eExtMEZjRFRqTmdoUWhPOVdMVVhRdFVlalFMLUtxaWhqU3VwSlF0U21VTXlrbmFxRUZjc2kzSzlZU1RtdVkyUXc4ZkVWdmhOMEpIUk43a1Vkb2tScGhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How can we lower our cortisol levels through diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution to lowering cortisol is to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/stress-busting-techniques/"&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt;. For busy mid-lifers who don’t have the time to practice breathwork or meditation, a cortisol diet might be the best way to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is closely linked with our gut health, and studies have shown that having high levels of good gut bacteria can help regulate cortisol levels. Similarly, an unhealthy gut can drive up cortisol and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-guide/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, says Ludlam-Raine. So it’s important to have a healthy gut to keep your cortisol levels stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood sugar regulation is also extremely important,” Ludlam-Raine adds.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Spikes and crashes from high-sugar or ultra-processed diets can increase cortisol as your body tries to stabilise energy levels.” Zoe Jane Hindle, a functional wellness practitioner, says: “In the morning, you need to make sure you’re eating a proper meal – having just a pastry is not enough. When your blood sugars go up, you will crash because you’re on a blood sugar roller-coaster without even realising it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about tweaking your diet to lower your cortisol levels make sure you avoid things like “bulletproof &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/over-60s-four-coffees-a-day/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;” which is often peddled as being a way to reduce it. The drink mixes coffee with grass-fed butter or ghee and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and promises boost energy levels and improve focus. However, it may cause more harm than good because of caffeine which can increase cortisol production. Eating a lot of saturated fats (found in butter and ghee) can also increase cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other fad worth swerving is Ashwagandha, an African plant which is popular in the wellness community for boosting calm and lowering stress levels. As promising as it may appear, those considering taking Ashwagandha should do their research beforehand – it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it doesn’t always make things better. It also may interfere with certain medications such as blood-pressure lowering medications, and ones that treat diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritise whole, minimally processed foods, eat regularly to avoid blood sugar dips and stay hydrated, says Ludlam-Raine. A balanced plate that includes fibre, healthy fats, protein, and complex carbs helps keep blood sugar stable and supports your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Nine foods to lower your cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Ludlam-Raine shares her top nine foods to help lower your cortisol levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Yoghurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A serving (150g) of plain, natural yoghurt with live cultures acts as a probiotic, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39458560/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that some probiotics may reduce cortisol levels. This can be the result of probiotics helping to reduce gut inflammation and, in turn, lower cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts contain omega-3 fatty acids as well as fibre and unsaturated fats, which support inflammation and brain health.

Drink your coffee while on a morning walk, or take a lap around the office (or your home!) in between meetings. You can also make socializing time more active: Instead of meeting a friend for dinner or drinks, consider a workout class or evening stroll.

These small, fuzzy fruits pack a big punch. Not only are they loaded with vitamin C, but just one kiwi contains 2 to 4 grams of fiber, something most Americans &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/fibermaxxing-dietitian-approved-heres-more-090046055.html" data-ylk="slk:aren’t getting enough of in their diets;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;aren’t getting enough of in their diets&lt;/a&gt;. And kiwis also contain actinidin, an enzyme that helps break down protein and therefore aids in digestion. So if you’re feeling a little backed up (ahem), or just want a refreshing summer snack you can feel good about, kiwis are a great go-to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/battery" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🔋;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🔋&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Skip that energy drink in the afternoon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the afternoon sleepies set in, it can be tempting to reach for something highly caffeinated — like an energy drink — to help you stay alert. But think twice, cardiologist Dr. Bhavna Suri tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/one-thing-never-ever-hour-175000247.html" data-ylk="slk:Parade;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; this week. “Drinking these substances in excess sometimes speeds up our heart rate too much, or can cause some extra heartbeats, called ectopy,” Suri explains, resulting in palpitations. Another downside? Drinking caffeine later in the day can interrupt our sleep, which can lead to heart issues down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So what can you do about that post-lunch energy slump? Suri recommends taking a 15-minute walk — and getting some fresh air — to feel more refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/grey-heart" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩶;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🩶&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Don’t wear heather gray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s hot out there!

Stylist Sophie Strauss has this top tip for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/natural-fibers-no-heathered-grey-140037389.html" data-ylk="slk:the Guardian;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: Avoid wearing heather gray, which has black undertones that make it appear much darker when wet (and making those pit stains way more obvious). Navy and dark green tops are more forgiving, she adds, while busy patterns can offer a nice distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/lime" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍋‍🟩;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍋‍🟩&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Avoid 'margarita burn'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Making margaritas for a summer party? Beware so-called margarita burn. Our friends at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/dermatology/articles/margarita-burn-dermatologist-warns-common-163632899.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; say that the lime juice in margs contains &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/furanocoumarin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:furanocoumarin;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;furanocoumarin&lt;/a&gt;, which can react with sunlight and cause a type of skin inflammation known as phytophotodermatitis. This type of rash, which can show up hours after you touch lime juice, may leave behind red marks that fade into brown patches and can take up to eight weeks to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still want to squeeze some limes for a fresh batch of margaritas? Make sure to rinse your hands immediately after juicing. Dermatologist Dr. David Kim tells &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; that if you’re already feeling the burn, use a steroid cream followed by brightening serums with kojic acid and arbutin, which can prevent brown patches from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/hamburger" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍔;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍔&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stop ruining your workout with this nutrition mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/articles/6-common-nutrition-habits-sports-162639317.html" data-ylk="slk:Self;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;, you might be sabotaging your workout gains with poor nutritional habits — like waiting too long to eat after you exercise. Unfortunately, doing so can delay muscle repair and increase soreness, leaving you feeling wiped out, dietitian Alex Larson explains. If you’re not eating a meal after your workout, go for a snack that combines carbs and protein. A glass of chocolate milk and a turkey sandwich are solid options — or, make a fruit smoothie with a scoop of protein powder or some Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/potted-plant" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🪴;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🪴&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Forego fake plants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interior designer Bri Macdonald tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/home-garden/home-decor/articles/im-interior-designer-works-wealthy-135801536.html" data-ylk="slk:Business Insider;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; that one thing that cheapens the look of a home is low-quality fake plants — but it’s not just aesthetics you should be concerned about.

And since cheese tends to be higher in salt, it’s often on the chopping block for folks looking to eat healthier. If you’re a cheese fan, though, you don’t have to cut it out entirely. Instead, experts for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/1-dairy-product-help-lower-190000841.html" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt; recommend avoiding higher sodium cheeses and opting instead for Swiss cheese, which is less salty than other varieties. For example, a one-ounce serving of Swiss cheese contains about 52 mg of sodium, while cheddar has about 185 mg. Plus, Swiss is rich in bioactive peptides, which may actually benefit blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-lifting-weights" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🏋️;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🏋️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Work out this body part daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Want to sneak in a daily workout that’s actually safe?

Because your core muscles — think abs, lower back, hips and pelvis — are smaller, they recover faster than larger muscle groups like your quads or biceps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Plus, building a strong core improves posture, reduces back pain, helps with balance and makes everyday movements easier.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A traditionally overlooked type of RNA plays an important role in promoting resilience to depression—but only in females. According to a new study led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, researchers have now discovered a novel role this molecule plays in how the female brain makes decisions. The authors revealed brain-region-specific and sex-dependent effects of this biomarker, translated from humans to animals, on how individuals make only certain types of choices. This study uncovered differences in how each sex decides whether to change their minds after making mistakes, including when to cut their losses and move on as well as how they process regrets about missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This research sheds important light on how specific types of decisions that could negatively impact mood engage the male and female brain in very different ways. The study, published July 11 in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances,&lt;/i&gt; using laboratory animal models, helps uncover new biological and psychological mechanisms that may be linked to psychiatric vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are twice as likely to develop depression than men. Furthermore, depression can manifest with different symptoms between the sexes, including alterations in negative rumination on the past. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our motivation for this work stemmed from a major gap in understanding why depression is more prevalent in females and how symptoms related to negative rumination take shape in the brain," said Brian Sweis, MD, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, and Neuroscience, at the Icahn School of Medicine and senior author of the paper. "We set out to investigate how the brain at risk for developing depression thinks about one's prior choices and how neural circuits that process such computations could contribute to disease burden in this way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study builds on a recent breakthrough involving a traditionally overlooked class of molecules known as non-coding RNA that were found to play a pivotal role in depression pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 study that leveraged analyses of postmortem human brain tissue, researchers also involved in the current study (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32304628/" target="_blank"&gt;Issler et al.&lt;/a&gt;) discovered that expression levels of the long intergenic non-coding RNA termed LINC00473 were reduced, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, in the brains of women—but not men—diagnosed with major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Orna Issler, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Neuroscience, and Anesthesiology, at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, lead author of that 2020 study, and co-author of the present study, said, "We translated these findings into an animal laboratory model and demonstrated a causal role of prefrontal LINC00473, when experimentally increased, in promoting resilience to stress in female mice only."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex is a key brain region essential for integrating mood with decision-making. In a key finding of the present study, researchers demonstrated that by surgically manipulating LINC00473 in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; in mice, they could enhance how females, but not males, changed their minds while foraging for rewards. By applying principles of neuroeconomics to their analyses, the authors discovered that increased LINC00473 levels drove behavioral differences in females by enhancing sensitivity to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar8644" target="_blank"&gt;sunk costs&lt;/a&gt; [overvaluing lost investments] and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add5579" target="_blank"&gt;regret&lt;/a&gt; [sensitivity to missed opportunities] related to change-of-mind decisions—traits that may be associated with resilience to stress. Importantly, this is the first study to show that non-coding RNA plays a functional role in cognition in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were able to selectively alter decision-making behavior involved in re-evaluating a recently selected choice without altering the initial judgment itself," said Romain Durand-de Cuttoli, Ph.D., Instructor in Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of this study. "Choices that depend on reflecting on the past are neurobiologically distinguishable from those that involve planning for the future. These are fundamentally distinct types of decisions processed in separate circuits in the brain, differently in males and females, that could in turn affect emotions in unique and complex ways."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The implications of this research are significant. The study points to a novel molecular target for new drug development as well as an anatomical target for brain stimulation therapeutics that could potentially treat depressive symptoms related to negative rumination, specifically for females. Furthermore, the study sheds light on psychological aspects of resilience vs. vulnerabilities to depression in females. This work offers new insights for establishing a mechanistic link between the neurobiology of stress responses and how affective states interact with our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research helps us appreciate that sensitivity to regret may not always be a bad thing. There are many 'flavors' of regret that could come from different parts of the brain and that can manifest very differently in males and females. Ruminating on the past, while potentially unpleasant, can still be useful for learning and can contribute to how we process emotions, deal with stress, and grow from past experiences," explained Dr. Sweis. "The challenge will be to disentangle what aspects of this are maladaptive and feed into worsening depressive symptoms and which are healthy, adaptive, and part of an intact coping strategy. It is also exciting that behavioral findings from an animal study can push us to ask new questions about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+psychology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human psychology&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could directly inform advances in psychotherapy tailored to the individual. This study is a step in the right direction toward these goals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This work emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of multiple fields, including psychiatry, psychology, and neuroscience," said Eric J. Nestler, MD, Ph.D., Interim Dean, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Chief Scientific Officer, Mount Sinai Health System; senior author of the Issler et al., 2020 study; and co-author of the present study. "Translational cross-species research that includes leveraging animal models is crucial for making unexpected discoveries and accelerating the development of richer diagnostics, innovative treatments, and improved outcomes for those struggling with mental illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;

This essentially means that Alzheimer's is a form of dementia, so dementia cannot be a form of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;She continued: "Okay, so dementia is the umbrella term, whereby there are lots of dementia syndromes that sit underneath. So you have Alzheimer's disease, you have vascular dementia, you have mixed dementia, you have Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"You have frontotemporal dementia, you have Lewy Body dementia, the Korsakoff's dementia.

From herbal extracts to vitamins and weight‑loss aids, certain products carry hidden dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five supplements that can cause fatal heart or liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turmeric (Curcumin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Liver risks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turmeric supplements are praised for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, but high-dose curcumin can lead to liver enzyme elevation, hepatitis, and even liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart-thinning effects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, curcumin has blood-thinning properties – dangerous when taken with anticoagulants or pre-existing bleeding disorders – potentially causing hemorrhagic events and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Moderation and monitoring:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Use only moderate doses under medical supervision, and avoid combining turmeric supplements with other blood-thinning medications without a healthcare provider’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green Tea Extract&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Benefits vs. risks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green tea extract (GTE), rich in EGCG catechins, is lauded for weight loss and antioxidant health benefits. However, high-dose supplements have repeatedly been associated with severe liver toxicity, sometimes requiring transplantation. Clinical case reviews show acute hepatitis within weeks of starting GTE products, with symptoms like jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. The European Food Safety Authority warns that daily intakes above 800 mg EGCG can damage the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart concerns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, green tea extract contains caffeine, which can spike blood pressure and heart rate, triggering palpitations or arrhythmia – especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safe use tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re taking green tea capsules, stick strictly to recommended doses – ideally under 338 mg of EGCG per day – or drink powdered tea, which is safer. Monitor liver function if usage is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Niacin (Vitamin B3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Liver toxicity:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Niacin is commonly used in high doses for cholesterol control. But medicinal doses – especially sustained-release forms – often cause elevated liver enzymes and, in rare cases, fulminant hepatic failure within days to weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart and metabolic effects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While niacin can raise HDL “good” cholesterol, it may exacerbate insulin resistance and negatively affect cardiovascular health when misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Guidelines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If using niacin therapeutically, it’s essential to undergo regular liver monitoring and consult with a specialist to balance benefits and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yohimbine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cardiac risks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yohimbine, derived from yohimbe bark and used for libido, fat loss, and athletic performance, stimulates the nervous system – raising blood pressure and heart rate, sometimes dangerously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Emergency cases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overdoses have led to headaches, panic attacks, seizures, and acute cardiac events, including arrhythmias and potentially fatal incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safe use advice:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If considering yohimbine, speak with a doctor – especially if you have hypertension or cardiac disease.

Multiple case studies link supplements like Hydroxycut and Garcinia cambogia to liver transplants or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="115"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors stress that consumers should approach supplements with the same caution as prescription medications. What seems like a simple wellness habit could lead to serious harm. If you're taking turmeric pills or any herbal supplements, consult your doctor and watch for signs like fatigue, nausea, or dark urine.

  &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle betweencontentmbo" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4114925436361820" data-ad-slot="5295535865" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-format="auto"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a telephone conversation, Sheneza Ali, the 29-year-old mother of Ibrahim yesterday related to the Sunday Stabroek that, “Investigation complete. The findings from the report I received in June from the Ministry of Health say the Skeldon Hospital delay time with him in which on Saturday [May 3], the hospital not suppose to turn down him with all da pain and so he was getting, they supposed to give him the round on Saturday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued that the findings also showed that there was no pharmacy and laboratory services provided on the weekends. “A next thing they [Skeldon Hospital] didn’t had no pharmacy and no lab on the weekend and holiday. So, they said they delay time with him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad"&gt;
  
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4114925436361820" data-ad-slot="5295535865" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-format="auto"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said when she took the report to the Office of the President (OP) with intention of showing it to the President, she learnt that the office already had a copy of it. So, she spoke with the secretary at the OP and she was asked what she wanted following the findings of the report. Her husband who was with her at the time responded, “My son done died… and he can’t come back and we are a poor family and we do a lot of expense for meh son funeral and tomorrow we have another reading for him. So, we have a lot of expense and so.” So, my husband asked for a little compensation and for disciplinary action be taken against the doctor to ensure that others don’t go through the same things like us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said that her husband wrote a letter on June 6th this year to the President on behalf of the family. She subsequently received a letter dated 19 June, 2025, stating that OP has received her husband’s letter of request and that it had been forwarded to the Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs for his attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad mbo"&gt;

She said that the family had also incurred a lot of expenses due to the death of her son. Ali also disclosed that so far, her three daughters including her baby are doing fine since she had all of them checked out for dengue at a private doctor and she plans to continue with their checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier report, the woman had said that on May 9, around 8 pm she received a visit from Minister of Health, Dr Frank Anthony, along with two doctors. At that time, she was informed that an investigation into the death of her child had commenced at the Skeldon Hospital and she would receive a response in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad"&gt;

They said they investigating it right now at the Skeldon Hospital and they will make contact with us,” she said, elaborating, “Dr Mahadeo, a female doctor and driver of the car and the Minister of Health came…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali explained that her six-year-old daughter, who was admitted to the Skeldon Hospital with dengue at the same time as her now deceased son, was discharged from the New Amsterdam Hospital on May 9. She said that she had asked the medical staff at Skeldon Hospital to discharge her daughter the same night her son was transferred to the New Amsterdam Hospital since it would have been difficult for her and her husband to visit her daughter at the Skeldon Hospital. She then took her two other children on the morning of May 7 to a private doctor in Spring-lands since they had the fever and they too were diagnosed with dengue. They were treated, and are now feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad mbo"&gt;

Me didn’t ask the doctor. I didn’t go back to her because if I did, it will be a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad"&gt;

We are deeply concerned by the circumstances surrounding this case and have therefore launched a full investigation into the events leading up to Lokesh’s death, including the handling of his case by medical personnel at the Skeldon Hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release added that a three-member team comprising Chief Medical Officer, Dr Narine Singh; Internal Medicine Specialist, Dr Shazeema Shaw; and General Surgeon, Dr Sheik Amir; had been appointed to lead the investigation. It assured that the investigation will be thorough and transparent, and any necessary actions or disciplinary measures would be taken based on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Stabroek News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 06:15:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxNSWo2bGM1bGlJT2xFU1VKZTNMYzJSRk5VOWM1YWNBWXlIT05yYzNLMnhUVmhFcU9XNFhYVmFYTnZpT28ydGNZTkZRcHhvLVI1WkNFNzdRRDhGVlpQMUZQbndVdmkzQXprYzFyNDM4dmpxS19UMmNhREJtLVdJM3VZdWtiM0l6bUthMlB6N1BhZkkwZk9GN2hyYmtlOW04QlAzQ2oybzhEUl8yZnc0WXRDelp1THdYaG80N2cyWU9FeDFWc29sN2NYV3doQQ</guid></item><item><title>我试着在睡前做这个简单的瑜伽拉伸一周，我的腰痛已经消失了- Fit&amp;Well | I tried doing this simple yoga stretch before bed for a week and my lower back pain has disappeared - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNYkhMWXVqYldKc1daYXhrY1ZBdFZCams3OThtaWpVbEZiX3B2MlowcFA3RFdnTmFpeXpFV1lkbFNYUnhfTE1hS1AzNXNLcDlCZkxKT0VlV04wOWJNZVRTUnhGM2N6R1cyNVpRZS1McktocUJCOEhKeTNLQTRhelU4aTY5UThHVllKcS1FQ1YxWk8wMG1WTGpadjI5VFdGYy1pekdWVXJJSHI4d0pUajFMYnpaZjRzVXBVU2laX1VRMkd5aWJHMVpkVW5vRGdJTzFGZzZDMUp5aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel most comfortable falling asleep on my stomach, despite the fact that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions/sleeping-on-stomach" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions/sleeping-on-stomach" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; say that belly sleeping can lead to aches and pains in the back and neck. The problem is, that I find it difficult to drop off on my side or back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having recently turned 30, I’m now paying the price for decades of belly sleeping. I’m waking up with lower back pain and I have started feeling a loss of spinal mobility throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it hurts to move in a certain way, I’ve been consciously (and subconsciously) avoiding those movements, which means I’m now less flexible when I do finally try to do them. For example, I’ve found myself less able to pick up items from the floor without squatting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that helps is a stretch called the seated forward fold but I’ve never done it consistently. But as the pain has increased, I decided to do it every day before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-to-do-the-seated-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When to do the seated forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late timing of the seated forward fold was recommended by April Flood, a physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://smithptplus.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://smithptplus.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Smith Physical Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi-NM3eDstmQ2FBA4509d1I9vO8xfHjsgbP" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi-NM3eDstmQ2FBA4509d1I9vO8xfHjsgbP slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator"&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;April Flood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://smithptplus.com/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood has a Bachelor’s degree in Biology and a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Clarke University in Dubuque, Iowa. She has spent her career working in the outpatient orthopedic field, treating a variety of post-operative and non-operative patients to help them return to their desired activity levels and improve their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives the muscles a good stretch and gives them the cue to calm down, so when you roll onto your stomach at night they don’t stay tight and guarded,” she says, explaining that ‘muscle guarding’ is when the surrounding muscles tense to protect a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By stretching in a direction that counteracts the positions your spine has been in all day, you give those muscles a chance to relax so they do not stay tight and tense while you are sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my aches could be caused by more than sleeping. “Even if you don’t experience low back pain during the day, the cumulative effect of prolonged sitting, or prolonged standing can cause pain by the end of the day,” she says because the spine is being impacted all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With nearly everything we do, our spine is working. It is also not uncommon for people, especially hypermobile people, to stand with their knees locked, which causes a forward tilt at our pelvis and then leads to extension of our spine,” she says. “We may not feel it at that moment, but later that night may be when you feel the effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the way I sleep compounds the problem. “When we lie on our stomachs we create further extension of our spine,” says Flood. “Those muscles along our spine, called the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Paraspinal_Muscles" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Paraspinal_Muscles" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;paraspinals&lt;/a&gt;, can get tight. As well as leading to hamstring and glute tightness,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stretching can help promote relaxation and help your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/parasympathetic-nervous-system.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.simplypsychology.org/parasympathetic-nervous-system.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; kick in to help you fall asleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the timing sorted, I just needed to make sure I was doing the move effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find a full seated forward fold quite difficult to do without some strain, so I turned to personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/thejordypt/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/thejordypt/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jordan Phelps&lt;/a&gt;, whose videos offer his clients variations of the move—meaning you can work your way up to the full stretch in three gradual steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-jordan-phelps-three-step-seated-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Jordan Phelps' three-step seated forward fold. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="step-1-3"&gt;Step 1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend both legs and reach towards the feet with both hands (this is your full seated forward fold).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to touch your feet if possible but if you can’t, or if it puts a painful strain on the back, then aim for your calves instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for one minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim to reach a little closer to the feet as time goes on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can reach the feet, aim to bend the elbows and lower the torso closer to the legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-i-found-after-doing-a-seated-forward-fold-every-day"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I found after doing a seated forward fold every day &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did the seated forward fold before bed every night for a week—without fail, even when I really couldn’t be bothered. It’s such a simple move that I wasn’t expecting huge results in just seven days. Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-stretching-progressively-was-very-helpful"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stretching progressively was very helpful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the cross-legged stretch and slowly progressing to the full forward fold helped me to achieve a deeper stretch. Jumping straight in with a full forward fold, both legs extended, was too intense for me and caused discomfort in my lower back and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I began by stretching over folded legs, it allowed me to ease down and stretch my muscles more gradually, so that when I did reach the final stretch, it wasn’t uncomfortable. This way I managed to achieve a deeper release in the last pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-woke-up-pain-free-the-first-morning"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I woke up pain free the first morning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem counterintuitive to stretch before bed instead of first thing when I’m feeling the most pain, but I took Flood’s advice and the timing worked really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first morning, I woke up without a stiff lower back for the first time in months. Instead of my usual creaky clamber out of bed, I sat up without the aches and lifted myself up with ease. The pains and aches didn’t return with the same intensity during the day either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-mobility-improved"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My mobility improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week of stretching before bed, I found that not only was I pain free in the mornings, but my mobility improved too. Twisting, reaching and even lifting something above my head might previously have triggered soreness in my lower back, but now I could move without issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not great at sticking to regular stretching, even when it’s helpful, so I’ll aim to do this a few times a week before bed as a preventative measure to keep the lower back pain at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m unlikely to adapt to sleeping on my back or side, so having this simple stretch to counteract any issues is great. And if the aches do return, I’ll know it’s time to increase the regularity with which I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The latest target of his campaigning is against &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/05/wes-streeting-weight-loss-jabs-ozempic-healthy-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Labour’s drive to provide weight-loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, which he says will be a “total, complete public health disaster” that he compares to telling patients: “I’m going to give you cancer as a way for you to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inevitably, the safety and benefits are grossly exaggerated, which means there’s no informed consent,” he says. “And we are now seeing that these particular weight-loss drugs are not good for your health, because you lose equal amounts of muscle as you do body fat with the jabs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that weight-loss medications can result in patients losing muscle mass, but studies have found the quantity is lower than the amount of lost fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra says that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/12/obesity-before-30-doubles-risk-early-death-cancer-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;obesity is a “marker for other health problems”&lt;/a&gt; including high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease, and that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/07/03/wes-streeting-half-my-colleagues-use-weight-loss-jabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weight-loss jabs&lt;/a&gt; only target the symptom, not the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as I’m concerned, until we have independent evidence showing that weight-loss drugs can actually improve those outcomes, it shouldn’t be given to a single human being,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Malhotra is hopeful that there may be an opportunity for him to use his solutions to the health crisis in the UK; he believes that Nigel Farage may be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think Nigel is a very courageous politician,” he says. “He’s not afraid to speak his mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is talk in Reform circles, given Farage’s popularity with Trump’s team, that Malhotra will address the party’s annual conference in Birmingham this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also been appointed as chief health adviser to Action on World Health, an anti-WHO campaign group co-founded by Farage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now his focus is firmly on the US. Today, he admits that initially he was “maybe a bit sceptical” when he first heard from one of RFK Jr’s aides that he was intending to suspend his presidential campaign and join &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/21/donald-trump-kamala-harris-mcdonalds-us-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Trump, who is known for his love of big corporations and – critically – McDonald’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once he decided he was going to do that, then I made the decision that I was going to support Trump winning the presidential election,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt that, you know, irrespective of Trump being a divisive character, I think he is a disrupter, and it’s the kind of disrupter that we need right now in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he says it was scepticism from the American public towards the same vaccine that Trump rolled out during his first term that helped propel him back into office last November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My view is the primary reason that President Trump had such a clear margin of victory over &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="http://telegraph.co.uk/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt; was because of Robert Kennedy Jr joining him,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main issue that most people were worried about and cared about in the US was the whole handling, and the mandating, and the lack of addressing the problem with the Covid vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That claim does not appear to be backed up by the most commonly-cited US polls, which showed that concerns about the cost of living and immigration were the greatest concerns of voters during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra also claims that 57 per cent of Americans felt that excess deaths during the pandemic were linked to the vaccine, “because they knew of a family member or a friend that had been severely affected by it”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cannot provide a reference to that survey, but a poll published last year found that around 28 per cent of Americans believe vaccines caused a higher death toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra attributes that shift to the rise of alternative media, such as the shows presented by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, on which he has often appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Wider agenda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this month, he will travel to Washington DC for a fundraiser for RFK Jr, when he says he plans to speak to him about health policy. He will continue living in the UK, for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite their working relationship, there are clear political differences between the clean-living doctor and the Trump administration’s health chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/13/trump-punish-drug-giants-world-will-pay-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;critique of big pharma companies is shared by some in Trump world&lt;/a&gt;, but he also has a wider agenda to increase the role of the state in people’s lives to boost wider health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a health policy summit in Texas in May, Malhotra, who shares the same paternalistic values as his father, a lifelong liberal, argued that to solve the US’s health problems the government must go far beyond what RFK Jr and his team have so far proposed on regulating food and drugs,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;including a planned ban on food dye and a war on seed oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he has claimed he is already in “active discussions” with senior MAHA officials about how to drive a more aggressive agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the summit, he spoke about his vision of how to get America healthy, promoting a radical Scandinavian-style approach to health that would include raising the minimum wage, providing more affordable housing and improving educational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Modern medicine actually has relatively little role to play in terms of your health,” he says, arguing that “maybe 10 per cent of life expectancy or health is determined by what your doctor prescribes for you in the hospital or in the clinic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he says socially determined factors – the “conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age” – are the greatest contributors to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are somebody who is in a low-pay, low-control, high-demand job, that, in a way, is effectively a death sentence in terms of the chronic stress it exerts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That paradigm shift needs to happen. If we don’t sort out the mind in terms of everything, in terms of our culture, how we interact with each other… then we can’t optimise our physical health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, he says the association between his &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/28/truth-about-covid-vaccines-may-finally-be-coming-to-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;scepticism of Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and Right-wing politics is more about the people who accepted his views after the death of his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I started speaking out on my U-turn on the whole issue of the Covid vaccine, the people that were the most supportive of me were actually people who I wouldn’t normally find myself being aligned with or having conversations with,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of his earliest supporters included Ron Johnson, the Republican senator who used his position as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee to invite witnesses who were critical of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that an uneasy coalition exists between members of the American Right and those like RFK Jr with fringe views on &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/12/11/barack-obama-broke-the-us-healthcare-system-only-the-left-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; – who are unlikely to agree on many of the long-term solutions to the issues they diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next year will reveal what influence Malhotra really has, and whether this British cardiologist is the man to help turn America’s health around. In the meantime, he thinks a “shift” of public opinion is under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing what’s happened in America, I think, will give hope to other politicians that have been a bit afraid to speak about these issues to speak up,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are living through a corporate tyranny. And I think once that is understood and acknowledged and collectively, we can fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;

A decade ago, as an NHS clinician, he founded Action on Sugar, a campaign group credited with forcing Public Health England to push for lower levels of sugar in popular products. At the time, he was branded an agent of the “nanny state”, removing packaging that appealed to children and forcing sugar warnings on the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cardiologist, 47, has also been a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/can-live-life-without-statins-cardiologist-says-can/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vocal critic of the widespread use of statins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vocal critic of the widespread use of statins&lt;/a&gt; – one of the most prescribed medications on the NHS – as a preventative drug to reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But it is since the outbreak of Covid-19 that he has risen to serious public prominence, first as a proponent of the UK government’s vaccine rollout, then as one of its fiercest critics. He has repeatedly claimed that the mRNA vaccines developed during the pandemic did “more harm than good” and called for them to be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now he has a new role which gives him a huge influence over global health policy. A long-time ally of &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/us-elections-what-donald-trump-victory-global-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s health secretary;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s health secretary&lt;/a&gt;, Malhotra was recently appointed chief medical adviser to the “MAHA Institute” (dedicated to RFK Jr’s “Make America Healthy Again” mantra), making him perhaps the most powerful Briton in Trump’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m in a unique position because of my work in the UK, because I span big pharma, big food policy, change, evidence-based medicine. And I’m a practising clinician,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although Trump’s “America First” hiring policy means that Malhotra cannot take an official post in the US government, the role offers almost unrivalled access to &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/rfk-jr-pledges-declare-covid-style-health-emergency-day-one/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the US health secretary;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the US health secretary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, pictured with Donald Trump at a campaign event last year, is a long-time ally of Malhotra - Carlos Barria/Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We meet in the basement of a smart building in Chelsea, where Malhotra works as a private consultant at the HUM2N longevity clinic, offering “biohacking” services alongside more traditional medical advice. The clinic has a sci-fi feel to it, with its array of futuristic-looking machines, including hyperbaric oxygen and cryo chambers, designed to offer members paying £300 a month drug-free “hacks” for their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wearing a loose, pale blue linen shirt, shorts and trainers, Malhotra has some patches of psoriasis on his skin which he suspects are from “vaccine injury” and tells me that he has consulted a leading doctor in the US about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra first came to the attention of RFK Jr in September 2022, after he published a paper on “misinformation about the Covid mRNA vaccine” in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Insulin Resistance&lt;/em&gt;. It led to him being interviewed on television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I walked out of the GB News studio and the first person to call me was Robert Kennedy Jr,” he recalls. “And he said, ‘Dr Malhotra, it’s &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/robert-f-kennedy-jr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert Kennedy Jr;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Robert Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; here. I want to thank you for your courage.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;RFK Jr announced he was running for president in April 2023, and built his campaign on a promise to curb ultra-processed food, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rfk-jr-appoints-new-government-vaccine-advisory-committee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scrutinise vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;scrutinise vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and encourage clean living, but he is a divisive figure in the world of health policy, not least for his previous support for claims that childhood vaccines can cause autism and that fluoride in the water can damage IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra is one of his strongest defenders, and believes he may have been the first to suggest the former Democrat ran for president – following in the footsteps of his father, Bobby Kennedy, and uncle, JFK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was very impressed with him, despite media reports of him being some sort of extremist in terms of his rhetoric and his advocacy on the issue of childhood vaccines,” Malhotra says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He almost had that presidential demeanour, in the sense that he had a presence. He was extremely articulate. He came across to me as having very high integrity, being compassionate and being a good listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I said, ‘He’s the right guy at the right time. We need someone like him, to restore integrity into politics.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Trust in doctors is at an all-time low,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He believes that the medical industry has been hopelessly captured by big corporate pharmaceutical companies, which he claims fund biased research into the safety of their own drugs and push patients into taking them. “Medicine has become an illusion. It’s been hijacked by these powerful commercial entities because they control the information that doctors utilise to make clinical decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Rejecting big pharma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra believes that &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/global-health-chiefs-welcome-rfk-attack-on-junk-food/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:RFK Jr is already having a serious impact on the Trump administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;RFK Jr is already having a serious impact on the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; and pushing the president himself away from pharmaceutical corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“&lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/donald-trump" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:President Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt; clearly has become more and more aware that the big corporations have abused their power and are undermining democracy – big pharma in particular,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On RFK Jr’s more contentious views, he is willing to give the health secretary a chance to assess the evidence for his claims again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He may not get everything right, but he’s open to changing his mind and opinion when he hears new evidence,” Malhotra says, adding that he, too, believes the widely-debunked link between vaccines and autism should be re-examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you’d asked me even three years ago, four years ago, ‘Dr Malhotra, do you think there’s anything between vaccines and autism?’ I’d have said: ‘Absolute nonsense, that’s been debunked’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But what the Covid vaccine has exposed is that there’s been a holy grail, if you like, on traditional vaccines. Now, I think we have to start from the perspective that no drug or vaccine is completely safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His view that every current vaccine should be completely reassessed for safety, he acknowledges, is far from mainstream in the UK. But he says it forms part of a growing chorus of medical professionals who reject the influence of big pharma in their industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So how did an NHS cardiologist, seen by some as a misinformation merchant, become a MAHA icon? His life story gives some clues to his surprising trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Born in New Delhi, he moved to the UK as a child with his doctor parents Anisha Malhotra and Kailash Chand. Dr Chand was a darling of the New Labour years and a prolific campaigner for the NHS. In 2012, he became deputy president of the British Medical Association and, the same year, received a national merit award from Labour leader Ed Miliband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A young Aseem attended Manchester Grammar School, where he batted first on the cricket team. His middle-school report card praised a “courageous, committed and able” young man, “with a sense of justice that does him proud”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra’s middle-school report card&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 1994 article he wrote for the school newspaper aged 16 warned that the British National Party was “just the tip of the iceberg” for discrimination in the UK and that “racism is in each and every one of us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is institutional racism which has to be opposed with all our might,” he wrote, suggesting an early interest in the failure of public bodies that would stay with him until middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra’s 1994 article on the BNP for his school newspaper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His interest in cardiology began even earlier in life when his older brother Amit, who had Down’s syndrome, died of heart failure in 1988 aged 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He had a viral illness that caused him to go into crashing heart failure within five days of being well,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Did his brother’s death inspire him to work on heart conditions as an adult? “Absolutely, yes,” he replies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The aspiring doctor then studied medicine at Edinburgh University, before working in a variety of UK hospitals and becoming a cardiology specialist registrar at the Royal Free and Harefield hospitals in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After the outbreak of the pandemic, in February 2021 he appeared on ITV’s &lt;em&gt;Good Morning Britain&lt;/em&gt; to promote the Covid vaccine for elderly people, saying, “We need to understand where this vaccine hesitancy is coming from,” that “trust needs to be restored” and that the “vaccines by far are the safest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But a few months later, following the death of his father soon after receiving the vaccine, he had a sudden change of heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When my dad died and had a cardiac arrest, someone tweeted, ‘It’s the vax!’,” he remembers. “I got so angry. I blocked them and thought, ‘This person is crazy and they are mad’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“And then, when I spent nine months looking at all the data, and reaching out to other people who have more expertise in particular areas, like immunology, it became very clear that this is what happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a trained cardiologist, Malhotra says he believes two “critical narrowings” in his father’s heart, discovered in the post-mortem, were &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/critics-claim-covid-jabs-causing-heart-problems-do-have-proof/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caused by taking the vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;caused by taking the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although there was no concrete evidence that his father’s death was caused by receiving a Covid vaccine, he believes it is the only explanation for the quick death of an otherwise healthy man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The conclusion, meanwhile, of the largest study of vaccine safety so far conducted, which included research on side effects among 99 million people and was published in the respected journal Vaccine in February 2024, found the presence of several conditions linked to the jabs but judged that they were extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think it’s time for a ‘just say no’ campaign,” says Malhotra. “We have seen the worst failures of the system in health with the rollout of the Covid vaccine, which has been absolutely catastrophic in terms of the harm it’s done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harm caused by the Covid vaccine has been ‘catastrophic’, says Malhotra - Jeff Gilbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The decision to reject the consensus view on vaccines, including from the British and American health authorities, has sometimes made his life more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two years ago, a group of doctors attempted to have his medical licence revoked, alleging that he had spread misinformation about Covid-19. The General Medical Council initially took no action, then announced in February last year that it would review that decision, after a legal challenge from one of the complainants. The review is on-going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I don’t think these people are ill-intentioned.

The BBC was forced to apologise and said the claims should have been challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A divorcee, he separated from his wife of five years, Sukriti, in 2010 – Malhotra has no children and lives a solitary lifestyle in Hampstead, waking at 4.30am each day to meditate and read before working out, working until around 5pm, then switching off his phone two hours before going to bed at 8.30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m obsessed with my own health, in the sense that I want to always be the best version of myself, physically and mentally, but also so I can teach others and help others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I consider myself an athlete,” he says, revealing that he has been using the cryo chamber in his office to treat a shoulder injury from the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He never eats sugar or starch, other than in porridge, and prefers a high-protein diet of Mediterranean and Indian food with at least 10 varieties of fruit and vegetables a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aseem Malhotra's daily routine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latest target of his campaigning is against &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/05/wes-streeting-weight-loss-jabs-ozempic-healthy-living/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Labour’s drive to provide weight-loss jabs on the NHS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Labour’s drive to provide weight-loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, which he says will be a “total, complete public health disaster” that he compares to telling patients: “I’m going to give you cancer as a way for you to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Inevitably, the safety and benefits are grossly exaggerated, which means there’s no informed consent,” he says. “And we are now seeing that these particular weight-loss drugs are not good for your health, because you lose equal amounts of muscle as you do body fat with the jabs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is some evidence that weight-loss medications can result in patients losing muscle mass, but studies have found the quantity is lower than the amount of lost fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra says that &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/12/obesity-before-30-doubles-risk-early-death-cancer-weight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity is a “marker for other health problems”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;obesity is a “marker for other health problems”&lt;/a&gt; including high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease, and that &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/07/03/wes-streeting-half-my-colleagues-use-weight-loss-jabs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight-loss jabs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;weight-loss jabs&lt;/a&gt; only target the symptom, not the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As far as I’m concerned, until we have independent evidence showing that weight-loss drugs can actually improve those outcomes, it shouldn’t be given to a single human being,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And Malhotra is hopeful that there may be an opportunity for him to use his solutions to the health crisis in the UK; he believes that Nigel Farage may be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I do think Nigel is a very courageous politician,” he says. “He’s not afraid to speak his mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is talk in Reform circles, given Farage’s popularity with Trump’s team, that Malhotra will address the party’s annual conference in Birmingham this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He has also been appointed as chief health adviser to Action on World Health, an anti-WHO campaign group co-founded by Farage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for now his focus is firmly on the US. Today, he admits that initially he was “maybe a bit sceptical” when he first heard from one of RFK Jr’s aides that he was intending to suspend his presidential campaign and join &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/21/donald-trump-kamala-harris-mcdonalds-us-election/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Trump, who is known for his love of big corporations and – critically – McDonald’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Trump, who is known for his love of big corporations and – critically – McDonald’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Once he decided he was going to do that, then I made the decision that I was going to support Trump winning the presidential election,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I felt that, you know, irrespective of Trump being a divisive character, I think he is a disrupter, and it’s the kind of disrupter that we need right now in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, he says it was scepticism from the American public towards the same vaccine that Trump rolled out during his first term that helped propel him back into office last November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My view is the primary reason that President Trump had such a clear margin of victory over &lt;a class="link " href="http://telegraph.co.uk/kamala-harris/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kamala Harris;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt; was because of Robert Kennedy Jr joining him,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The main issue that most people were worried about and cared about in the US was the whole handling, and the mandating, and the lack of addressing the problem with the Covid vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That claim does not appear to be backed up by the most commonly-cited US polls, which showed that concerns about the cost of living and immigration were the greatest concerns of voters during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra also claims that 57 per cent of Americans felt that excess deaths during the pandemic were linked to the vaccine, “because they knew of a family member or a friend that had been severely affected by it”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He cannot provide a reference to that survey, but a poll published last year found that around 28 per cent of Americans believe vaccines caused a higher death toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra attributes that shift to the rise of alternative media, such as the shows presented by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, on which he has often appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Wider agenda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later this month, he will travel to Washington DC for a fundraiser for RFK Jr, when he says he plans to speak to him about health policy. He will continue living in the UK, for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But despite their working relationship, there are clear political differences between the clean-living doctor and the Trump administration’s health chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/13/trump-punish-drug-giants-world-will-pay-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:critique of big pharma companies is shared by some in Trump world;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;critique of big pharma companies is shared by some in Trump world&lt;/a&gt;, but he also has a wider agenda to increase the role of the state in people’s lives to boost wider health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At a health policy summit in Texas in May, Malhotra, who shares the same paternalistic values as his father, a lifelong liberal, argued that to solve the US’s health problems the government must go far beyond what RFK Jr and his team have so far proposed on regulating food and drugs, including a planned ban on food dye and a war on seed oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And he has claimed he is already in “active discussions” with senior MAHA officials about how to drive a more aggressive agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the summit, he spoke about his vision of how to get America healthy, promoting a radical Scandinavian-style approach to health that would include raising the minimum wage, providing more affordable housing and improving educational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Modern medicine actually has relatively little role to play in terms of your health,” he says, arguing that “maybe 10 per cent of life expectancy or health is determined by what your doctor prescribes for you in the hospital or in the clinic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead, he says socially determined factors – the “conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age” – are the greatest contributors to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are somebody who is in a low-pay, low-control, high-demand job, that, in a way, is effectively a death sentence in terms of the chronic stress it exerts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That paradigm shift needs to happen. If we don’t sort out the mind in terms of everything, in terms of our culture, how we interact with each other… then we can’t optimise our physical health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If anything, he says the association between his &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/28/truth-about-covid-vaccines-may-finally-be-coming-to-light/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scepticism of Covid vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;scepticism of Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and Right-wing politics is more about the people who accepted his views after the death of his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I started speaking out on my U-turn on the whole issue of the Covid vaccine, the people that were the most supportive of me were actually people who I wouldn’t normally find myself being aligned with or having conversations with,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of his earliest supporters included Ron Johnson, the Republican senator who used his position as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee to invite witnesses who were critical of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is clear that an uneasy coalition exists between members of the American Right and those like RFK Jr with fringe views on &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/12/11/barack-obama-broke-the-us-healthcare-system-only-the-left-r/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; – who are unlikely to agree on many of the long-term solutions to the issues they diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next year will reveal what influence Malhotra really has, and whether this British cardiologist is the man to help turn America’s health around. In the meantime, he thinks a “shift” of public opinion is under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Seeing what’s happened in America, I think, will give hope to other politicians that have been a bit afraid to speak about these issues to speak up,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We are living through a corporate tyranny. And I think once that is understood and acknowledged and collectively, we can fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/customer/subscribe/01doysa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One food will not make or break your weight loss goals—it's all about variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like dairy, whole grains, potatoes, eggs and popcorn can all be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on healthy cooking methods to enjoy foods with a bad reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain foods have an unwarranted negative reputation. When people talk about these foods, they use words like “bad” and “weight gain”. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. No single food can cause weight gain or loss. Weight fluctuations occur as a result of your daily diet over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a matter of fact, these five “bad” foods may actually help with weight loss. Although the foods on this list can have an unhealthy stigma, they are full of protein and fiber, two nutrients that help facilitate weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, many foods you may believe are off-limits can be part of a healthy eating pattern. Here are five “bad” foods that may help you reach your weight loss goals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably seen recommendations to include low-fat dairy in your daily eating pattern, but what about full-fat dairy, like whole milk, cheese or butter? These foods have more calories and fat than their lower-fat counterparts, but research suggests that including full-fat dairy may not affect weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has not found a link between consuming full-fat dairy and weight gain, nor is it associated with an increased risk of obesity in children or adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And although calorie concerns are higher among whole-milk drinkers, most Americans don’t consume the recommended three servings of dairy foods per day in the first place. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another concern about full-fat dairy is that it has more saturated fat than lower-fat versions. For reference, an 8-ounce serving of milk has 4.5 grams of saturated fat as compared to 1.4 grams in 8-ounces of 1% milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, research concludes full-fat dairy consumption does not negatively affect cardiometabolic risk factors or heart disease. In addition, fermented dairy foods, such as full-fat yogurt and cheese, may actually protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-carb-rich-grains"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Carb-Rich Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrate-forward grains, like pasta, bread and rice, are often thought of as “bad” foods that people should restrict. Although these grains are rich in carbohydrates, they can still be part of a healthy weight-loss diet. Research has not found a difference in weight loss results when people who were overweight followed a low-carbohydrate diet instead of a balanced-carbohydrate diet. Rather, the authors claim that the total calorie intake matters more for weight changes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grain-weight-loss-8387518" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grain carbs&lt;/a&gt;, like brown rice and quinoa, are rich in fiber, a nutrient that helps regulate appetite and contributes to a healthy weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Eggs  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are constantly under the spotlight because they are a cholesterol-containing food. But eating eggs does not directly impact &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8023641/can-you-eat-eggs-if-you-have-high-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; or heart disease risk, and eggs can be a healthy part of a weight loss plan. One large egg has just 70 calories, 5 grams of fat and 6 grams of protein, making it a balanced addition to the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One review study examined 32 controlled clinical trials and revealed that eating eggs did not significantly affect body weight. The authors attribute these findings to the protein in the egg, which helps increase satiety and fullness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, studies with calorie restriction and healthy subjects found that whole egg intake actually decreased body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that’s often used in health care to determine a person’s body weight category (such as underweight, overweight or obese) and, therefore, chronic disease risk. However, it has limitations and does not account for individual factors that influence one’s health status, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, sex and age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Potatoes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This starchy root veggie receives a lot of shade due to its high carb content. But, believe it or not, the type of starch in potatoes can help contribute to weight loss. Potatoes contain resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate that “resists” digestion and controls appetite. One study found that eating potatoes suppressed appetite and reduced short-term food consumption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, pairing potatoes with a protein-rich food increased satiety and reduced hunger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So go ahead and fill your potato with plenty of protein-rich foods, like beans, eggs, dairy or chicken, for a weight loss-friendly meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may think of popcorn as a “bad” snack food, but it’s a healthy fiber-rich, low-calorie whole grain. One cup of air-popped popcorn has just 30 calories and 1 gram of fiber, making it a crunchy and satisfying low-calorie snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although there isn’t much research on the benefits of popcorn for weight loss, one study compared the short-term satiety from low-fat popcorn with potato chips and found that people who ate popcorn expressed less hunger, more satisfaction and said they ate less food overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But, when enjoying popcorn, be mindful of the other added ingredients. Additional flavors, like butter, caramel or chocolate, can add up to a lot of calories and fat that may not align as well with weight loss goals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although you may think a certain food is “bad” for weight loss, perception doesn’t always match reality. Foods like potatoes, popcorn and eggs can be part of a healthy weight-loss diet. It’s also important to remember that one food cannot make or break your weight loss goals or healthy eating regimen. Think of the diet as a whole and include a variety of whole foods with fiber and protein to keep you full and satisfied.
