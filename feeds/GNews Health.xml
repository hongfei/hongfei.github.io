While many people know these crunchy green seeds help balance blood sugar levels, there’s a lot more to them than meets the eye. According to U.S.-based gastroenterologist Dr. Pal Manickam, pumpkin seeds are one of the most underrated superfoods you can easily include in your diet, and they’re surprisingly affordable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram video and a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dr. Pal shares seven science-backed reasons to add pumpkin seeds to your daily routine. “If you're not including pumpkin seeds in your diet, you're seriously missing out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123668491" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what makes these little seeds so powerful? Let’s break down the seven benefits he shared, including one he calls his personal favourite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;1. Boosts Immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, a key mineral that strengthens the immune system and helps your body fight infections more effectively. Including them in your meals can be a tasty way to keep seasonal illnesses at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;2. Supports Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to their high magnesium content, pumpkin seeds help maintain a steady heartbeat and regulate blood pressure. Magnesium is also known to support overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123668491" id="div-vdoai-mid-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123668491" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3. Improves Mood and Relaxation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds contain tryptophan, an amino acid that converts into serotonin, the “feel-good” hormone. This can help improve mood, reduce anxiety, and promote better sleep, something many people overlook when managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;4. Strengthens Bones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds also offer a good dose of phosphorus and magnesium, which are essential for bone strength and density. Regular consumption may reduce your risk of conditions like osteoporosis later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;5. Balances Blood Sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-known benefit, pumpkin seeds help regulate insulin levels and keep blood sugar in check, thanks again to their magnesium content. This makes them a smart snack option for people managing diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN-q3UmCZKU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;6. Helps with Cravings and Weight Loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pal’s personal favourite benefit: curbing cravings. Packed with healthy fats and protein, pumpkin seeds keep you full for longer, making it easier to avoid mindless snacking and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;7. Protects Skin and Eyes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded with antioxidants like vitamin E and carotenoids, these seeds help reduce inflammation, slow signs of aging, and protect your eyes and skin from damage caused by environmental stress.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is Dr Pal Manickam?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the unversed, Dr. Pal Manickam is not your average doctor. Known for mixing health advice with humour, he has built a large following across social media. He shares easy-to-understand, science-based health tips, often focusing on gut health, intermittent fasting, and holistic wellness. Dr. Pal completed his MBBS at PSG Medical College, Coimbatore, India, then a Master's in Public Health at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and an MD in Internal Medicine at Wayne State University, Detroit, before steeping into gastroenterology fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pumpkin Seeds vs Flax and Chia seeds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, pumpkin seeds stand out as a simple yet powerful superfood. While flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fiber and omega-3s, pumpkin seeds don’t need grinding and offer a wider variety of nutrients, including zinc, magnesium, and protein. This makes them an easy, all-in-one option for daily nutrition.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-align="" data-msid="123668794" data-type="image" class="midImg clearfix"&gt;&lt;figure class="imgBg"&gt;&lt;img title="Seeds" alt="Seeds" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg" class="lazy gwt-Image" data-msid="123668794" data-original="https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-123668794/seeds.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="midCap font_mon"&gt;Difference between flax seeds, chia seeds and pumpkin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imgActions flr"&gt;&lt;span class="asSprite imgZoom zoomIcon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you want a healthy and affordable snack, skip the supplements and just grab a handful of pumpkin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 16:06:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>两兄弟患有相同的遗传性疾病。他们的保险仅为其中一名患者提供改变生命的治疗-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gene-therapy-brothers-insurance-chicago-b2820259.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 dDhojf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 cUJDWn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 jEZjIj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

The disease causes muscle degeneration and weakness due to a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle fibers from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease, which mostly affects boys, gets worse over time. It makes it difficult to walk, run, jump, and play, with children often delayed in reaching milestones like crawling, walking and talking. The boys will likely use wheelchairs when they are teenagers, and life expectancy ranges between 30 and 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bVpsol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Hunter, 10, (left) and brother Noah, 9, (right) were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017.

Noah received pioneering gene therapy in March this year, which has significantly helped his mobility, his parents said. But Hunter’s insurance claim for the same treatment was denied.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Noah received &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/fda-ap-washington-patients-pfizer-b2362590.html"&gt;pioneering gene therapy &lt;/a&gt;to improve his mobility and quality of life through Alison’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/patients-health-insurance-employees-people-mercer-b2813474.html"&gt;health insurance plan&lt;/a&gt;. But when Hunter’s application was submitted in late May, authorization for exactly the same treatment was denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason on our denial letters is that it's not medically necessary,” the mom-of-three said from her home in Winnetka, just outside Chicago. “It was very blindsiding. They didn't ever deny my other son, it was approved the first go. So I was very taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison, a physician, and her husband William, who works in finance, are now grappling with how to move forward following the decision from health insurance giant, Blue Cross Blue Shield. They say they have been put in an impossible and “heartbreaking” situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;contacted Blue Cross Blue Shield for comment, and asked why the treatment was only covered for Noah when both boys have the same disease. &lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;also asked the company whether it would reconsider the denial in Hunter’s case and to respond to accusations that the decision was “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To protect our member’s privacy, we do not publicly discuss individual cases,” a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson said. “We do want our members to know that medical experts, including doctors, are involved in reviews to ensure the treatments and services our members receive are evidence-based and not duplicative. Decisions are guided by nationwide best practices for care, helping to identify what has proven successful for members in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every passing day, Hunter’s condition gets worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His muscle is wasting away every day,” Alison, 44, said. “He's going to be in a wheelchair in the next few years and it just doesn't seem right that they are not going to allow him to get this treatment. They're wasting his time. And it’s just not fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brothers were diagnosed with DND in 2017 after tests showed Hunter had elevated liver enzymes, which is indicative of the condition. Three months later, when further tests showed the levels had not returned to normal, a specialist delivered the devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DND is a genetic disorder and so Noah and 12-year-old brother Carter were tested following Hunter’s diagnosis. Carter did not have the disease, but Noah’s results came back positive. It was a triple blow for Alison, who not only had to process the fact that two of her children had the life-limiting illness but that she was a carrier of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents and their eldest son Carter have had to go through the pain of witnessing Hunter and Noah gradually decline over the years, as DND has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2023, there was a glimmer of hope when the gene therapy, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.parentprojectmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ELEVIDYS-FAQ-for-community.pdf"&gt;Elevidys&lt;/a&gt;, manufactured by Sarepta Therapeutics, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ethnCd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Alison and husband William, pictured with their boys Hunter, Noah and Carter.

Both of the younger boys were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017, which has no cure&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new treatment, which comes with a $3.2 million price tag, helps improve muscle function and motor skills. So far, over 900 patients have had the treatment, the company says, but given how novel the medicine is, critics say there is limited evidence that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors are cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these newer gene transfer therapies are opening doors for these boys to possibly live longer and lead a good quality of life,” said Dr Aravindhan Veerapandiyan of Arkansas Children’s Hospital. “It’s changing the trajectory of the disease, changing the trajectory of their lives, improving the quality of life for the boys and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevidys is not without controversy. It was approved by the FDA in 2023 but limited to children between 4 and 5 years old, who are able to walk. In 2024, the treatment was expanded to include patients 4 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Public Citizen, a nonprofit which acts an ethics watchdog for clinical trials, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.citizen.org/article/failed-trials-yet-full-fda-approval-of-a-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-gene-therapy/"&gt;said the FDA approval was “ill-advised”&lt;/a&gt; because it was “not supported by favorable FDA scientific reviews”. Nor did clinical trials demonstrate that children with the disease “maintained or regained gross motor abilities”, the group added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was heightened concern in July when the FDA told Sarepta to suspend distribution of the drug while the agency investigated the death of an 8-year-old boy. The FDA subsequently concluded the death was “unrelated to the gene therapy product itself” but the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-recommends-removal-voluntary-hold-elevidys-ambulatory-patients"&gt;agency has still recommended the company pause&lt;/a&gt; distribution of the drug in patients who cannot walk. However, this doesn’t apply to Noah or Hunter, who can both still walk and play with their older brother, Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alison and William, Elevidys was worth trying. “We had very serious conversations with our doctors, but we also know the natural progression of the disease,” Alison said. “So we were willing to take that risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.archildrens.org/blog/revolutionary-gene-therapies"&gt;Arkansas Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Little Rock, his parents said. Elevidys was administered as a one-time infusion.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“End of day fatigue and leg pain was something that he complained of frequently, and he has not complained of it once since getting gene therapy,” Alison said. “He learned how to swim this summer. His overall endurance is so much better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, meanwhile, continues to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people now will say,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Oh my gosh, Noah's doing so well… We can't believe he's swimming, he's this, he's that,” Alison said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;And, I'm like, Oh my gosh, please don't let Hunter hear… because I know that he's thinking that he's not able to do those things. And it's just heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Noah’s treatment was given the green light by the insurance company, both boys underwent their routine, annual cardiac MRIs to take a closer look at their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bLBZUf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock, his parents said.

Noah (left) with his brothers, Hunter (right) and Carter (center)&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cardiologist determined that the risk with the treatment was greater for Hunter than it was for Noah, whose MRI showed normal cardiac function for a child. Therefore, the family decided that Noah should have the treatment first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We collectively made a decision that the safest thing to do is give it to his brother,” Alison explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company gave the green light for Noah’s treatment on November 1, 2024, and he received it a few months later in March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Noah’s treatment went well, doctors, including cardiologists, then gave their approval in April for Hunter to have the same treatment. BCBS denied coverage for the treatment in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited that they gave us the green light. It was like, Oh my gosh, let's go. Let's do it,” Alison recalled. “We told Hunter, ‘It’s your turn,’ never expecting the insurance to say no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom asked: “I mean, how could they say no to him when they already said yes to his brother and he successfully had it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after digging through health insurance paperwork, Alison and William claim that after Noah received approval from BCBS in November 2024 for Elevidys, the insurance firm “quietly” updated company policy on January 1, 2025 to exclude the children’s specific DND mutation from coverage for the gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think it's coincidence,” Alison said. “I think that they knew that we had another child and we were going to be seeking this out [again.]” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company did not address the allegation when&lt;em&gt; The Independent&lt;/em&gt; contacted them for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents are running out of options to get their son the life-improving treatment unless BCBS reconsiders the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have appealed the decision with the insurance giant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple has also contacted representatives in Arkansas, where Hunter would receive the gene therapy treatment, and in their home state of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas state representatives Andrew Collins and Tippi McCullough both offered the family assistance, while Arkansas U.S. Senator Tom Cotton supported the family in reaching out to the federal Office of Personnel Management, Alison said. The parents have also consulted with a lawyer to weigh their options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am starting to feel helpless,” said Alison. “I feel like we have tried to make the best decisions for them all these years, and now the choice has been taken away from us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is not on Hunter’s side and the gene therapy is his best chance of having the most comfortable life possible, his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the age when the boys really do start to decline pretty quickly,” said Alison. “We have seen a significant decline in him in the last few months, which is just so scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapy can stop the disease’s progression. We are just watching him decline before our eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 12:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQbVVUTE1Xd2lCUXhjRktNckNSYVh1Wk8wbjVMMFU0ZFBLMndQdVduMHM3SGphSHV4Z0ZTMUlDbURQZVJfMmZQM2tKUm9UQXEyME8tSlUtQjlRc3JKcG9kQlhkNl9PNTczSURhZW1pYjkxRjBNdE1ONzBsakdCcmZjNkNrNjYtRVZwVnJMVUQ1X3U0X3R4S0dZRkVPZGlScWdiakZlZ0ZB</guid></item><item><title>饥饿的癌症：新饮食减缓小鼠最致命脑肿瘤的生长- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/starving-cancer-new-diet-slows-growth-of-deadliest-brain-tumors-in-mice/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have discovered that brain cancer cells reprogram their sugar metabolism, a vulnerability that can be exploited in mice to impede tumor growth and enhance therapeutic outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor, and patients diagnosed with this condition typically survive only one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these tumors, ordinary brain cells change their behavior, multiplying quickly and spreading into nearby tissue. Unlike healthy brain cells, the cancerous cells process nutrients in a fundamentally different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-michigan/"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, including experts from the Rogel Cancer Center, the Department of Neurosurgery, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, investigated how glioblastoma cells metabolize glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that these tumors rely on distinct nutrient pathways compared to normal brain tissue, offering new insight into potential treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We altered the diet in mouse models and were able significantly slow down and block the growth of these tumors,” said co-senior author Daniel Wahl, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of radiation oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study may help create new treatment opportunities for patients in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional treatments consist of surgery followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, the tumors eventually return and become resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers have shown that resistance is due to metabolic rewiring within cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cancer cells in the brain use sugars differently compared to healthy cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolism is the process by which our bodies break down molecules like carbohydrates and proteins so that our cells can either use them or build new molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both brain and cancer cells depend on sugar, the team wanted to see if they use sugar differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They injected small amounts of labelled sugar into mice and, importantly, into patients with brain tumors to follow how it is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To really understand these brain cancers and improve treatments for patients, we needed to do the hard work of studying the tumors in patients themselves, not just in the lab,” said co-senior author Wajd Al-Holou, M.D., a brain tumor neurosurgeon who co-directs the Michigan Multidisciplinary Brain Tumor Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both normal tissues and tumor cells used a lot of sugar, they used it for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a metabolic fork in the road,” said Andrew Scott, Ph.D., a research scholar in Wahl’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain channels sugar into energy production and neurotransmitters for thinking and health, but tumors redirect sugar to make materials for more cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that healthy tissues used sugars to generate energy and make chemicals that allow the brain to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastomas, on the other hand, turned off those processes and instead converted sugar into molecules like nucleotides—the building blocks of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; and RNA—that helped them grow and invade the surrounding tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amino-acid restricted diets can improve treatment outcomes in mice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noticed other important differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal brain used sugar to make &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;amino acids&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Amino acids are organic molecules that serve as the building blocks of proteins, essential for nearly all biological processes. There are 20 standard amino acids, which combine in various sequences to form proteins with different structures and functions. Some are synthesized by the body, while others must be obtained through diet.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;amino acids&lt;/span&gt;, the building blocks of proteins. However, brain cancers seemed to turn this pathway off and instead scavenged these amino acids from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding led the researchers to consider whether lowering the levels of certain amino acids in the blood could affect brain cancer without affecting the normal brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tested whether mice that were fed an amino acid-restricted diet had better treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we got rid of the amino acids serine and glycine in the mice, their response to radiation and chemotherapy was better and the tumors were smaller than the control mice that were fed serine,” said co-senior author Deepak Nagrath, Ph.D. professor of biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their measurements in mice, the team also built mathematical models that can track how glucose is being used in different pathways, which can help identify other drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-senior author Costas Lyssiotis, Ph.D., professor of molecular and integrative physiology, compared metabolic pathways to roads and drugs to roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping a roadblock on a fast highway with a lot of traffic will have a greater effect than blocking a country road with a lower speed limit and only a few cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in a normal brain, the uptake of the amino &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; serine from the blood is like a slow country road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But brain cancer is like a busy freeway, giving researchers the opportunity to selectively target the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is working on opening clinical trials soon to test whether specialized diets that limit blood serine levels can also help glioblastoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a multidisciplinary effort from across the university,” Wahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a study that no individual investigator could do on their own and I’m grateful to be part of a team that works together to make important discoveries that can improve treatments for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;By age 40, more than half of Americans have high blood pressure, but many are unaware of it. Hypertension has long been known as the silent killer. When it's left untreated it can be deadly. And it's considered a silent threat since most people have no symptoms. You can't feel the pressure in your blood vessels increasing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" target="_blank"&gt; recommendations&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association aim for &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-high-blood-pressure-guideline-emphasizes-prevention-early-treatment-to-reduce-cvd-risk" target="_blank"&gt;early treatment&lt;/a&gt;, including lifestyle changes and medications, once systolic blood pressure rises above 130/80 mm Hg, (which stands for millimeters of mercury, a measure of pressure). Experts say it's clear that the sooner you take action, the more you can protect yourself. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, which is the&lt;a href="http://cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20is%20the%20leading,lost%20productivity%20due%20to%20death." target="_blank"&gt; #1 cause of death of both men and women&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. High blood pressure also increases the risk of kidney disease and dementia. And, research shows that hypertension can lead to damage in small blood vessels in the brain, which is linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a really enormous preventive health opportunity in treating hypertension earlier," says &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8561973" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jordana Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, a nephrologist and hypertension specialist at the University of Pennsylvania. She says millions of adults in the U.S. could benefit from medications and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you catch it early, and treat it early, you can end up with many more years of healthy life expectancy," Cohen says, pointing to a reduced risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney damage and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines point to decades old advice about the benefits of a low-sodium diet, which can be challenging to follow, given &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495308/ultra-processed-food-upf-rfk-cdc#:~:text=Ultra%2Dprocessed%20foods%20still%20make,:%20Shots%20%2D%20Health%20News%20:%20NPR" target="_blank"&gt;more than half the calories&lt;/a&gt; consumed in the U.S. come from ultra-processed foods, which tend to be high in salt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize lifestyle strategies including exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and stress reduction in the form of meditation, yoga, or deep breathing. For people with systolic blood pressure ( the upper number) in the 130s, the recommendation is to start with these diet and lifestyle-related changes, then move to medication if blood pressure doesn't improve.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For people who hit the risky range of a systolic blood pressure of 140 or higher, which is considered stage 2 hypertension, evidence shows starting on high blood pressure medications is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For all people with a blood pressure over 140/ 90, mm Hg, we recommend beginning with two medications," Dr. Dan Jones, chair of the guideline writing committee at the Heart Association, told NPR. Research shows one medication alone is often not enough to lower blood pressure to the optimal range, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jones says even when people are aware they have hypertension, more than half don't manage to lower it to the normal range, which is 120 /80 mm Hg or lower. Some of the challenges include side effects of the medications and individual differences in how well the medication works, as well an unwillingness to take medicines among some people. In addition, some people struggle the everyday hurdles of making lifestyle changes. Jones points out that healthcare providers also use a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191" target="_blank"&gt;risk calculator&lt;/a&gt; to estimate a person's individual risk of heart disease, as part of a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When George Solomon was told about the risks of high blood pressure he was hesitant to take medications. "I felt fine," he says. Then, at age 63, he had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solomon had retired from a career in law enforcement, and was settling into a new routine, making time for exercise and hobbies, such as splitting wood on his farm. One day in the spring of 2023, he started to feel off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I went upstairs to watch TV, and when I sat down in the chair, I couldn't get back up. I had a sensation that came up across my back," he recalls and he lost feeling in his arm and leg. An ambulance took him to Duke University Hospital, near his home, where he underwent treatment and rehab for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He estimates that he's now about 80% recovered, and back to exercising and working on his farm. He realizes now that he needs healthy lifestyle habits and medications to prevent another stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I feel I'm on the right path ," he says. He's lost weight and he's doing more cardio and strength training. He's sharing his story in hopes it encourages others to take action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications: what's out there, what's coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are several types of medications used to treat hypertension. They include diuretics that help the body get rid of extra salt and water, ACE inhibitors that help block the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, and help relax the blood vessels and calcium channel blockers that &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22316-calcium-channel-blockers" target="_blank"&gt;slow down the movement of calcium into cells&lt;/a&gt;, which can help lower pressure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many people with hypertension don't get enough reduction with current medications, and University of Pennsylvania's Cohen says there's a lot of interest in a new class of medication that works by targeting the hormone aldosterone, which helps regulate fluid and sodium in the body. Too much of the hormone is one cause of high blood pressure. The drug is not yet on the market, but new study results could pave the way for a new treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In hypertension, we haven't seen anything new that's effective since the nineties," Cohen says. So another tool in the toolkit for treatment could be beneficial, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2507109" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine found the aldosterone blocking drug, known as baxdrostat, was effective in lowering blood pressure in many people who have difficulty controlling their hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study included about 800 people who, despite taking two or three medications, still had not lowered their blood pressure to the normal range. "What we saw is that after 12 weeks of treatment, there was about a ten point improvement in blood pressure in the patients treated with baxdrostat, over the placebo effect, Dr. Jennifer Brown, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who is one of the researchers behind the study, told NPR. The study was sponsored by drugmaker Astra Zeneca, which plans to &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2025/baxdrostat-demonstrated-statistically-significant-clinically-meaningful-reduction-sbp-patients-hard-control-hypertension-baxhtn-phase-iii-trial.html" target="_blank"&gt;share its data&lt;/a&gt; with regulatory authorities by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A 10 point drop in systolic blood pressure is linked to about a 20% reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and also a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            Edward Mowery&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lived with excruciating pain for years: Picture being put into a hot frying pan, he said, and then someone holding you down on that pan forever. The fiery, shooting pain got so bad that he quit his job, stopped playing sports and had to abandon his beloved death metal band just as the group was taking off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0002336nltj4gub3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At one point, I didn’t have any feeling in my arms or hands or anything,” said Mowery, 55, who lives in New Mexico. “I couldn’t put one note on a guitar, much less play like I do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0003336njik3uz57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But everything changed when doctors tried a cutting-edge approach to pain management. If they can refine the technique to make it less intrusive and demonstrate that it works on others, doctors think this technique could radically transform the way people manage debilitating and otherwise untreatable chronic pain — no opioids or pain blockers required.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The state of the art right now for picking a medication for an individual patient is trial and error” when it comes to pain, said &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/prasad-shirvalkar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar,&lt;/a&gt; a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “Trying to be your own guinea pig, that’s essentially what we’re doing right now in pain medicine.” Finding something more precise that could stop a pain signal in the brain before it could be felt in the body would be a huge shift.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0004336nnq26ipeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

Of them, about 8.5% are like Mowery, living with chronic pain that interferes with day-to-day life, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7215a1.htm#:~:text=CDC%20analyzed%20data%20from%20the,experienced%20high%2Dimpact%20chronic%20pain." target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;

            Mowery says he was a rambunctious kid and got injured a lot while skiing and playing soccer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0006336n0ydza4oo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Altogether he says he’s had 34 surgeries, including 11 painful knee surgeries, as well as foot, back and neck surgeries. The bigger problem, though, started with a part of his body that hadn’t even been injured.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0007336nh8x1jdxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week after a routine knee replacement in 2009, his right foot started to feel like it was on fire.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf3cfa2s00033b6qlj8cjssh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spoke with “all kind of doctors, trying to figure out what was going on,” but nobody could explain the pain. Some didn’t even believe that he was in pain, assuming he was an opioid addict looking for pills. “That’s the one thing, when they put me on all these meds, I wasn’t addicted to all the meds, I was addicted to getting rid of the pain,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0008336nqaoyvnmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eight long years, he said, doctors couldn’t figure out what was causing the pain. But in 2017, when his foot turned purple and black, he went to a pain specialist in Albuquerque who took one look and told him he had complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0009336nrqkamk7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CRPS is a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crps-complex-regional-pain-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20371151" target="_blank"&gt;kind of neurological&lt;/a&gt; pain, often in the extremities, that can develop after a surgery, stroke, injury or heart attack that is out of proportion to the severity of an initial injury. It can make blood vessels dilate or constrict, leading to skin discoloration, swelling and temperature changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000a336nwbujq0mg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery says doctors explained that when the acute pain from his knee went away, his brain essentially missed that feeling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000b336n47hzf0oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because I’d been in pain for so long, my brain was so used to being in pain that it said, ‘Oh, you need to have this back,’ ” he said. “Manufactured pain from the brain with no stimulus. It’s unreal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000d336n9nf72hap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors put him on a variety of pain medications, including morphine and oxycodone, that he didn’t like because he felt so out of it. At one point, he took 17 pills&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a day, but nothing worked for long. Always athletic, Mowery ended up relying on a walker or a wheelchair to get around﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000e336nzkwj4749@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really depressing. You would think they’d call CRPS the suicide disease,” Mowery said. “A lot of times, I was sitting there just going, ‘what am I going to do? There’s nothing out there for me.’ “
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000f336n55d8sui1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spent years searching the internet for clinical trials and finally found one at the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/complex-regional-pain-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. The description of the research seemed vague but he filled out the questionnaire anyway and, within 40 minutes, he said, he got a message urgently asking him to come to San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000g336nj1fv360i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relief from his years of agony would soon come after doctors persuaded him to let them drill several holes in his head.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000i336n53tp9dpk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shirvalkar says he has long wanted to solve the puzzle that is pain. He had success treating neurological conditions but less success treating their chronic pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000j336ny7sk3osl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are people that have been failed by all available therapies. They’ve tried over 25 different medications. They have had multiple injections and nerve blocks.&lt;br&gt;They’ve even had spinal cord stimulators or peripheral stimulators, and nothing can alleviate their suffering,” Shirvalkar said. “We started appreciating that the brain must be generating or perpetuating these pain signals in a person. So the question becomes, how can we identify what these signals are and really try to suppress or short-circuit them?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000k336nt8q95cgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acute pain, like when someone stubs a toe, affects the brain differently from chronic pain, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000l336nz8ffq1oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think of chronic pain as a fire alarm. The alarm is helpful for acute pain. We want to be able to know when there’s an emergency,” he said. “In chronic pain, it’s as if the fire alarm is going off, but we can’t identify the fire.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000m336ntcsrk4b8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When pain becomes chronic, it rewires the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000n336nwajlih0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It starts to take on these other dimensions that include mood and motivation and involve attention and memory, and so we really have to address the cognitive aspect of it,” Shirvalkar said. “It tells me that when someone has developed chronic pain, treating it with a single drug or injection or some monotherapy probably isn’t going to work.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000o336nozb470wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the help of a $7.56 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Shirvalkar and a team at UCSF have been exploring &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, a technology sometimes used with people who have Parkinson’s disease, to treat pain conditions like Mowery’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000p336n3gw7kjmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With Parkinson’s, doctors implant electrodes in the brain that produce electrical impulses to disrupt the abnormal signals that cause tremors, stiffness and slow movement. Shirvalkar wondered if they could also use the a version of the device to redirect or suppress the brain’s pain signals to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000q336n0imd0qt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were a few challenges with this approach. The device sends signals around the clock in someone who has Parkinson’s, but Shirvalkar thought a constant signal wouldn’t work for chronic pain because the brain can become acclimated to the impulses and essentially override them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000r336n8go3iat6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another challenge was figuring out what part of the brain was sending pain signals.&lt;br&gt;There’s no one central location that does this, and it could be different in different people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000s336nht0x1lb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet another challenge would be to quickly sense when the brain was about to send out a pain signal – or even anticipate it – and shut it down quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000t336nour7em6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team used computational models and AI to essentially detect a biomarker that could track how severe a person’s chronic pain would be, similar to how an A1C level can tell whether someone has diabetes and how severe it is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000u336n61kdkkqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to learn whether deep brain stimulation could work for pain, the team first had to persuade Mowery that he should have another surgery. He was reluctant to have another procedure. This trial would require three.
    &lt;/p&gt;





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000v336nh5r2h5l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It took Mowery about 18 months to decide the trial was right for him – time in which the worsening pain essentially wore him down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000w336nv9uxvdk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the first surgery, doctors would map Mowery’s brain to determine where the pain came from. Another surgery would remove the temporary probes from the first procedure. A final procedure placed permanent probes in the correct areas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000x336n14blzlb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first part of the trial, Mowery spent 10 days in the hospital while doctors created a grid of more than 100 points on his head to try to find different circuits or certain activation for pain by watching and stimulating his brain. Even with eight- to 10-hour days probing his brain, it wasn’t until day five or six that the researchers had their “eureka moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000y336n7qs30a2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of a sudden, Ed says, ‘Wow, my pain just washed off of me,’ ” Shirvalkar said. “I was blown away. I didn’t know what to say.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000z336no3jsng0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Concerned that it could be the placebo effect, the doctors kept testing to make sure they had the right targets. Shirvalkar quickly became confident that they had picked the right areas when Mowery&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;immediately felt the pain in his feet, legs and lower back dissipate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0010336ni6ns5086@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When it comes to actually understanding what’s driving someone’s chronic pain, we say there’s no pain center, right? But it tells us if chronic pain is this complex lock, it tells us that yes, that there is a key to be found. So it gives us hope.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0011336nkebbazkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Much more research will be done to see if this technology can work for everyone or whether there would be even better technology that would be less invasive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0012336n73vanbcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In August, Shirvalkar and his team &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.11.25333010v1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of their tests of this technique on six people. The team followed the patients for 22 months and were even able to randomize the trial so some got the stimulation and some did not. Those who got stimulation reported a reduction in pain of about 60%, while the placebo group got no such relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0013336ny5uk6pb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery has resumed his normal daily activities, including playing his guitar. He can monitor what’s going on in his brain with an iPad app and just has to periodically charge the device that sends the signals to his brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34e62j00023b6q3mcwjbg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s not totally pain-free, he says: He’ll have a bad day sometimes, but it’s infrequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34emfl00043b6qt9bgfvpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says Shirvalkar’s work changed his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0014336nibiqkgof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way it detected pain, the way it turns off pain, the way I’m getting off all these medications, I feel like I owe him my life,” Mowery said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0015336nx5jcpwir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery felt so much better that, in June, he &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/news-events/blog/congressional-briefing-highlights-brain-initiative-research-addiction" target="_blank"&gt;accompanied Shirvalkar&lt;/a&gt; to Washington to testify before Congress’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience Caucus about the impact of the NIH BRAIN Initiative on addiction research and on this pain treatment alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34frk500063b6qz2dgn0un@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shirvalkar is concerned about future funding amid the current political environment and other funding cuts at the NIH.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0016336n8chdi69f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “NIH funding is always a concern. Fortunately, we’re doing OK for the time being,” Shirvalkar said. “We’ll have to wait and see.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0017336nnss8pwu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery hopes that his experience will provide enough of an example so people can see the possibilities of such medical research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0018336nhav4nuge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have been called a medical astronaut before, and my sister is an actual astronaut, and she finds that funny,” Mowery said. “It’s a miracle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

I don’t have a sense of who I am. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Pierrat’s mind once ran as smoothly as the gears on his endurance bike. He was a mechanical engineer by training and a marathoner for fun, a guy who maintained complicated systems at work and a meticulously organized garage at his Westlake Village home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after his diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, Marc’s thoughts are a jumble he can’t sort out alone. Once-routine tasks are now incomprehensible; memories swirl and slip away. His wife, Julia Pierrat, 58, shepherds Marc, 59, through meals and naptime, ensures he is clean and comfortable, gently offers names and words he can’t find himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often impossible for a person to talk about the internal experience of living with FTD, either because they can’t accurately assess their internal state or don’t have the language to describe it. In many cases the disease attacks the brain’s language centers directly. In others, a common symptom is &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2957481/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;loss of insight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the ability to recognize that anything is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But minds can unwind in a million different ways. In Marc’s case, the disease has taken a path that for now has preserved his ability to talk about life with what one doctor called “the most difficult of all neurologic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;    &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Corinne Purtill" data-video-id="00000199-1b69-d0d7-afd9-df7d3b250000" data-video-platform="gvp" data-video-title="A Different Dementia: Understanding FTD and Its Impact" data-internal-video-id="00000199-1b66-dfcb-afbf-fbee534b0000" data-player-id="fe1b823c1080e49278d37020ad8e01979" data-autoplay-threshold="50" data-vertical data-lazy-offset="1.0"&gt; &lt;div class="container"&gt; &lt;div data-vjs-player class="video-js  vjs-9-16  skin bg-transparent"&gt; &lt;video playsinline="playsinline" loop preload="none" title="A Different Dementia: Understanding FTD and Its Impact" data-video-id="00000199-1b69-d0d7-afd9-df7d3b250000"&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-720p-29-97fps-2000kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-720p-29-97fps-3500kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-540p-29-97fps-2500kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-360p-29-97fps-600kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/file-group/250905-ftd-custom-generic-hd-mp4-av1-aac-16x9-720x1280p-30hz-2mbps-qvbr-vq7.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;   &lt;/video&gt;         &lt;div data-element="gvp-share-container" class="lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:z-10 lg:w-full"&gt;  &lt;ps-actionbar data-element="action-bar" class="font-cms-font-service-text  ct-hidden action-bar-video h-10 w-full top-0"&gt; &lt;ul data-element="action-bar-menu" class="flex gap-2 list-none  absolute w-full h-10 top-0"&gt;       &lt;li data-element="action-bar-share" class="flex  w-full h-10 top-0 lg:items-center lg:justify-center "&gt; &lt;button data-element="action-link" class="flex absolute right-2.5 top-2.5 z-25 border-0 hover:!bg-transparent  bg-transparent cursor-pointer" aria-label="Share" data-modal-trigger&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flex items-center justify-center p-1 text-[#fff]  pointer-events-none"&gt; &lt;use xlink:href="#share-more-arrow-solid"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/button&gt; &lt;div data-element="action-bar-content" class="ct-hidden"&gt; &lt;p data-element="action-bar-overlay" class="fixed inset-0 z-1050 bg-cms-color-brand-background opacity-50" data-modal-close&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div data-element="action-bar-modal" class="p-2.5 fixed w-full left-0 right-0 bottom-0 z-1050 bg-cms-page-color-background rounded-t-lg lg:relative lg:shadow-none  lg:max-w-35   lg:p-5 lg:rounded-lg"&gt; &lt;p data-element="action-bar-modal-header" class="relative flex justify-between mb-2.5 text-base text-cms-color-brand-text lg:text-xs"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Share via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;button data-element="share-close-button" class="absolute flex p-0 top-0 right-0 justify-center align-center bg-transparent border-0 lg:-top-2.5 lg:-right-2.5 cursor-pointer" data-modal-close&gt; &lt;svg class="icon close-icon h-3 w-3 fill-cms-color-icon-brand hover:fill-cms-color-icon-service"&gt; &lt;use xlink:href="#close-x"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Close extra sharing options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ps-actionbar&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/gn-video-player&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people in the U.S. live with FTD. Marc can speak for only one of them, and at times he does so with clarity that breaks his wife’s heart. Occasionally Julia records snippets of conversation with his permission, mementos from a stage of marriage they never saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like walking into a closet you haven’t been in in a while, and you’re looking for something that you know is there, but you don’t know where,” Marc said recently, as Julia looked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then, you know, you just — yeah. You just give up,” he concluded. “It’s the giving up part that’s hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;

Like, if you’re going to catch a ball, you know, you have the ball in the air, [and] you have to raise your arm and your glove, and you catch the ball. And FTD interferes with all of that. So it makes it harder to catch the ball. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;More than 6 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. currently live with dementia, an umbrella term for conditions affecting memory, language and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 90% of dementia cases are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the progressive memory disorder, or by strokes and other vascular problems that disrupt blood flow to the brain.

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FTD, abnormal proteins accumulate in the brain’s frontal or temporal lobes, damaging and eventually destroying those neurons. It’s frequently misdiagnosed, and so the number of current U.S. cases is hard to pin down — estimates place it between 50,000 and 250,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By far the best-known person living with FTD is the actor Bruce Willis, whose family &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.theaftd.org/mnlstatement23/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disclosed his diagnosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willis has primary progressive aphasia, the second-most common form. In his case, the most damaged tissues are in his brain’s left frontal or left temporal lobes, which play crucial roles in processing and forming language. One of his first noticeable symptoms was a stutter, his wife Emma Heming Willis has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAnrCO0S1do" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in interviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; he now has minimal language ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But FTD is highly heterogeneous, meaning that symptoms vary widely, and it has affected Marc and Willis in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease has several subtypes based on where the degeneration begins its advance through the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierrat has the most common subtype, behavioral variant FTD. His disease has targeted his frontal lobes, which manage social behavior, emotional regulation, impulse control, planning and working memory — essentially, everything a person needs to relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTD typically presents between the ages of 45 and 60. Because it shows up so much earlier than other dementias, its initial symptoms are often mistaken for other conditions: depression, perimenopause, Parkinson’s disease, psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything we think and do and say to one another depends on very specific physical locations in our brains functioning correctly. Behavioral variant FTD strikes right at the places that house our personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an eloquent person suddenly can’t form sentences, it’s typically seen as a medical problem. But when an empathetic person suddenly withholds affection, it’s perceived as an act of unkindness. The truth is that both can be the product of physical deterioration in a previously healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you were to describe to another person what it’s like to live with FTD, how would you describe it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh my God. . . . Well, you can’t assess situations accurately. You see a train coming, and it’s gonna smash into your car, and you’d be, like, ‘Oh. Huh. That train’s gonna hit my car.’ And there’s nothing you can do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sign came in late 2018. Marc, then 52, was in a fender-bender a few blocks from home and called Julia for a ride. When she arrived, he was not just surprised to see her, but angry. Why was she there? Who’d asked her to come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was taken aback by his forgetfulness, and more so by his hostility. Marc could be stubborn and confrontational; over the decades, they’d argued as much as any couple. But this outburst was out of character. She chalked it up to nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc was a respected project manager in the pharmaceutical industry.

Their daughter was pursuing a doctorate at UCLA. The couple enjoyed life as empty nesters with shared passions for road trips and camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a year or two after the accident, nothing happened that couldn’t be dismissed as a normal midlife memory lapse or a cranky mood. But by late 2020, something had undeniably changed. The harsh parts of Marc’s personality ballooned to bizarre proportions, smothering his kindness, generosity and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lost a phone charger and accused Julia’s mother of stealing it. He misplaced his binoculars and swore his sister took them. The neighbors asked the Pierrats to trim their gum trees and Marc flew into a rage, ranting about a supposed plot to spy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work performance and exercise habits appeared unaffected, which only made his outbursts more confusing — and infuriating — to Julia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of the disease nobody knew he had any issue, other than he seemed like a total jerk,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pierrats did not know they were at the start of a chaotic period distinct to sufferers of FTD’s behavioral variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything that can affect relationships is at the center of the presentation of the behavioral variant,” said Dr. Bruce Miller, director of the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. “The first instinct of a spouse or a child or a human resource program or a psychiatrist [is to] assume a psychiatric problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the condition start to lash out at loved ones or lose interest in lifelong relationships. They may snarl at strangers or shoplift at the mall. They consume food or alcohol obsessively, touch people inappropriately or squander the family’s savings on weird purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at first, just like in the Pierrats’ case, nobody understands why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone is not who they were, think neurology before psychology,” said Sharon Hall, whose husband Rod — a devoted spouse who delighted in planning romantic surprises — was diagnosed in 2015 after he started drinking heavily and sending explicit texts to other women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Julia’s insistence Marc visited his doctor in July 2021, who referred him to a neurologist.

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few years earlier, bosses and colleagues &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierrat/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;praised Marc&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a superlative manager. In January 2022 he was put on notice for a host of causes: combative emails, obnoxious behavior, failures of organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home he botched routine fix-it jobs, missed crucial appointments and got lost on familiar routes. He stopped showering and called Julia appalling names. She went to therapy and contemplated divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on July 18, 2022, the couple sat across from a neurologist who delivered the diagnosis with all the delicacy of an uppercut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no cure, he told them, and few treatment options. He handed them a pamphlet. Marc showed no emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the car Julia sobbed inconsolably as Marc sat silent in the passenger seat. Eventually she caught her breath and pulled out from the parking lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you like being married? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, I do. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It makes me a better person.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That’s so sweet. How do you think it makes you a better person?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being able to talk to you and, you know, resolve through different problems together. I mean, it’s good to have an extra mind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They left the neurologist with nothing: no instructions, no care plan, not even the stupid pamphlet, which was about memory problems in general. “It was diagnose and adios,” Julia said. “I hit the internet immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia now had three different roles: her paid job, Marc’s 24-hour care, and a part-time occupation finding support, services and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Eventually she became a volunteer AFTD ambassador, speaking and advocating for families affected by the disease. In August, she posed for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1278118587342049" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a group photograph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the state capitol with Emma Heming Willis and other FTD advocates who traveled to Sacramento to meet with state lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of it is a way of finding purpose in pain. FTD has dulled Marc’s emotional reactions, leaving Julia to carry the full weight of their grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He grasps the impact, but somehow the emotion is buffered,” she said. “I lose it sometimes. I cry my eyes out, for sure. I feel the full emotional impact of it, in slow motion. . . . There’s no blunting it for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/702aa77/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b75a88b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a2d066/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/76100df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1080x720!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb7c360/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1240x826!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b851c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a57f66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/2160x1440!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F21%2Ffd14570f47329d27967600556822%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-023.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days the Pierrats rise around 6 a.m., eat the breakfast Julia prepares, and then Marc takes his first nap of the day (fatigue is a common FTD symptom). When he wakes around 9 a.m. Julia makes sure he uses the bathroom, and then drives him to a nearby adult daycare program where he does crafts and games until lunch. He sleeps for another few hours at home, spends two hours in the afternoon with a paid caregiver so that Julia can do errands or exercise, and then the couple eats dinner together before Marc beds down by 8 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they are awake together, they go for walks around the neighborhood or to familiar cafes or parks. The hostility of the early disease has passed. They speak tenderly to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each sleep, Julia walks him upstairs to the bedroom they used to share. She tucks him in and gives him a kiss. At night she retires to a downstairs guestroom, because if they share a bed Marc will pat her constantly throughout the night to make sure she’s still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My clock’s ticking.

Or do you feel healthy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I feel kind of healthy, but I’m still worried. Because I have something that I can’t control inside of me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, Julia and Marc were on one of their daily walks when she realized they had already had their last conversation as the couple they once were, with both of them in full possession of their faculties.

  &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in other ways, their connection remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The love that we have is still completely there,” she said recently in the couple’s backyard, while Marc napped upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re married to someone and you’ve been with someone for so long, you almost have your own language between you. He and I still have that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looked out over the potted succulents and winding stone pathways they had spent so many weekends tending together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of our relationship is preserved in spite of it, which is just so interesting, [and] also makes it more heartbreaking,” she continued. “Because you know that if the disease plays out like it is expected to, you will just continue to slowly lose pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average life expectancy for people with Marc’s type of FTD is five to seven years after diagnosis. Some go much sooner, and others live several years longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all FTD variants lead to a similar end. Cognition and memory decline until language and self-care are no longer possible. The brain’s ability to regulate bodily functions, like swallowing and continence, erodes. Immobility sets in, and eventually, the heart beats for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until then, people keep living. They find reasons to keep going and ways to love one another. The Pierrats do, anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df18a1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d90765/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2b1868/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f170d49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1080x720!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f63144a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1240x826!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73b4f1a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/573b12d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/2160x1440!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F97%2Fc011999645d8bd16964014a02b21%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-015.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

And he would be proved right. In 1980, after a decades-long public health campaign that included widespread vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;smallpox had been eradicated&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the only infectious disease where this has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A sleugh of other vaccines have been developed against other diseases, from influenza to human papillomavirus infections that cause certain cancers and the Sars-COV-2 virus behind Covid-19. In the past 50 years, an estimated &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00850-X/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;154 million lives have been saved by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, according to one recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet, opposition to vaccines – or hesitancy about accepting them – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/1/31" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is widespread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jgrlxx37do" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of the world, even percolating into the uppermost branches of governments responsible for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;improving public health&lt;/a&gt;. This week, US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was quizzed by the Senate Finance Committee over his vaccine policies, resulting in fiery exchanges. On the same day, the surgeon general of Florida also announced plans to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;end vaccine mandates in the state&lt;/a&gt;.

Why do they face protests from relatively small, but vocal, segments of the public? And how have these arguments evolved? This is a look at the long, and strange history of the anti-vax movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Back in the early 1800s, a series of controlled experiments by Jenner and other doctors quickly showed inoculation to be extremely effective, granting immunity against smallpox in well over 95% of those vaccinated. Public health authorities worldwide took action to roll it out. In the UK, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_Act" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a series of Vaccination Acts&lt;/a&gt;, passed in 1840, 1853 and 1871, made immunisation for children first free, then compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:01:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOYlpHZkJTV0V4bFNwVWNTNXMxdXJ1UzhZd09sNTVVX0RUaUlJb0pVWjBWaDNLT1ZNRjJMUGRXVVJhYnhXVE5XejRaSnVTSk9tZzRRR3h0dXplTlpvLVpONVRIZXVpbFdPZVpybmk4aGpxeTdrUUZ2SXpJU0hYcWc1RkZUTGNWSVpuUGo0d29IZHRMeXRUVGNn</guid></item><item><title>在亚马逊上购买Halle Berry的亲密和健康产品- TMZ</title><link>https://www.tmz.com/2025/09/07/halle-berry-respin-intimacy-products/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article__header"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the national trends in cancer death rates between 2018 and 2022 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Family cancer syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hereditary (or family) cancer syndrome is a rare disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing certain types of cancer. The disorder is caused by inherited genetic variants in cancer-related genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One sign a family may be affected is if multiple members get diagnosed with the same kind of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier explained that, during a routine visit, physicians will typically take a family history of cancer dating back at least three generations. If there is any history of early-onset cancers, the doctor will usually suggest genetic counseling and testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no outrunning genetics, experts say there are ways to lead a healthier life and reduce your risk of developing cancer yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to prevention is a combination of healthy lifestyle and staying proactive with checkups, said Dr Cedrek McFadden, a surgeon and associate professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts reveal six ways you can reduce your risk of developing genetic cancers that run in your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk, including cancers of the breasts and colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No matter the type of cancer in your family, Dr McFadden and Dr Messier both suggest regular exercise to reduce your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said people should aim to get 150 minutes of exercise a week - or about 20 to 30 minutes per day, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But don’t let perfect be the enemy of good,' Dr McFadden said. 'Even a brisk 20-minute walk most days adds up. Just move; your body will thank you for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Helen Messier told the Daily Mail diet can be a key way to reduce cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said if lung cancer, specifically, runs in your family, exercise is key as 'healthy lungs love movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier added: 'Exercise controls insulin, soothes inflammation, helps balance hormones and maintains weight - all fundamental cancer-prevention mechanisms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study in Cancer Cell International found physical activity may reduce the risk of colon cancer, which impacts about 107,000 people per year, by 23 percent when comparing people who exercise the most to those who exercise the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology suggested physical activity could prevent nearly 15 percent of colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For breast cancer, which will see about 320,000 new cases this year, a 2016 analysis published in the European Journal of Cancer found the most physically active women had a 12 to 21 percent lower risk than those who were least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2020 study in the British Journal of Cancer found women who reported the most exercise per week had a 23 percent decreased risk of breast cancer compared to those who exercised the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Diet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier said a clean and healthy diet can be crucial for reducing all types of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said if colon cancer runs in your family, avoiding processed meats like bacon, sausage and deli products can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet high in fiber, fruits, vegetables and whole grains has also been found to lower colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden echoed those sentiments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'If [a parent] had colon cancer, it's worth cutting back on processed meats... and even limiting red meat in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I tell my patients to lean into a fiber-rich diet... Your gut bacteria thrive on that, and over time, that supports a healthier colon.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, both experts said no food is a magic bullet, but the Mediterranean diet 'gets a lot of praise for a reason'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes 'lots of plant-based foods, healthy fats like olive oil, lean proteins and fewer processed snacks or sugary drinks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors agree that, 'Basically, if it grew from the ground, it’s probably good for you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12471615/DR-MICHAEL-MOSLEY-eating-olive-oil-nuts-fish-Living-like-Med-good.html"&gt;said a 'Mediterranean-type diet abundant in the plants is the gold standard - packed with vegetables, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and lean proteins like fish.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Minimize ultra-processed foods, sugars and alcohol. Foods high in phytonutrients, such as berries, cruciferous vegetables, turmeric and green tea also may be protective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight are also two factors to consider when trying to cut your familial cancer risk, Dr Messier said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map from the Environmental Protection Agency. It shows radon levels across the country, which reveal 25% of Americans live in areas where levels are considered unsafe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier told the Mail that even if you have never smoked, a close family member who was a smoker and was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer could still put you at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung cancer is estimated to affect about 227,000 people in 2025, with 124,000 deaths. People exposed to secondhand smoke have a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both doctors advise quitting smoking, avoiding secondhand smoke and steering clear of all tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also urge people to avoid other toxins - particularly radon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier and Dr McFadden recommend testing your home for radon, a radioactive gas that has no color, smell or taste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gas - which comes from the natural decay of uranium, a radioactive element found in nearly all soils - is present in both indoor and outdoor air and there is no known safe level of exposure to the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14305279/map-radioactive-gas-hotspots-linked-cancer.html"&gt;radon exposure is the second most common cause of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US after smoking, leading to about 21,000 deaths each year, according to the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Angelina Jolie (pictured) had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after testing positive for a gene that increases breast and ovarian cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Genetic testing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charles Oyesile, a medical research physician, told the Daily Mail people with a family history of cancer should consult with an oncologist and genetics counselor to assess their individualized risk given their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing can help determine the best course of action - whether that is undergoing genetic testing to see if you are a carrier of any cancer-related genes, or starting cancer screenings at an earlier age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While genetic tests won't prevent cancer, they can tell you if you are at a heightened risk, which could help you make certain life choices - such as exercising more, quitting smoking, following a cleaner diet or undergoing certain preventative procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the BRCA genes, a blood test can identify genetic variants in the APC gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tumor suppressor gene is crucial for preventing the development of colon cancer. Mutations in the APC gene can lead to familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable condition that causes polyps in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, in turn, raises the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden said, 'In some cases, a genetic test can tell us which screenings you actually need and when. Don’t guess - ask your doctor. We’d much rather have that conversation now than after something shows up later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Prophylactic surgery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having prophylactic surgery to remove organs that increase your risk of cancer is one way to fend off a familial pattern of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, if genetic testing shows you carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, you may opt for a prophylactic double mastectomy (removal of the breasts) or oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) - procedures Angelina Jolie had when she found out she was a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jolie underwent genetic testing because her mother battled cancer for nearly a decade and died at 56. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene, doctors estimated Jolie had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She chose to have both breasts removed and get implants in 2013. Her chances of developing breast cancer dropped to 5 percent, she &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in a piece for The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other types of preventive surgeries include a colectomy - where part or all of the colon is removed to prevent colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Preventative screenings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screenings also won't prevent cancer, but they can help detect the disease in earlier stages - and an early-stage diagnosis means the cancer may be easier to treat and could have a higher survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your grandmother, mother or sister was diagnosed with breast cancer, Dr Messier suggests talking to your doctor about beginning screenings like mammograms earlier than the generally recommended starting age of 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden said a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer may be warranted earlier than recommended - typically 45 years old - if a sibling was diagnosed with the cancer before the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where personalized screening plans come in,' he said, 'and they can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Screenings are] not one-size-fits-all. If it’s colon cancer, you might start colonoscopy earlier. If it’s breast or prostate cancer, we might begin mammograms or PSA testing sooner.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Family cancer syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hereditary (or family) cancer syndrome is a rare disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing certain types of cancer. The disorder is caused by inherited genetic variants in cancer-related genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One sign a family may be affected is if multiple members get diagnosed with the same kind of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier explained that, during a routine visit, physicians will typically take a family history of cancer dating back at least three generations. If there is any history of early-onset cancers, the doctor will usually suggest genetic counseling and testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no outrunning genetics, experts say there are ways to lead a healthier life and reduce your risk of developing cancer yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to prevention is a combination of healthy lifestyle and staying proactive with checkups, said Dr Cedrek McFadden, a surgeon and associate professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts reveal six ways you can reduce your risk of developing genetic cancers that run in your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk, including cancers of the breasts and colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No matter the type of cancer in your family, Dr McFadden and Dr Messier both suggest regular exercise to reduce your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said people should aim to get 150 minutes of exercise a week - or about 20 to 30 minutes per day, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But don’t let perfect be the enemy of good,' Dr McFadden said. 'Even a brisk 20-minute walk most days adds up. Just move; your body will thank you for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Helen Messier told the Daily Mail diet can be a key way to reduce cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said if lung cancer, specifically, runs in your family, exercise is key as 'healthy lungs love movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier added: 'Exercise controls insulin, soothes inflammation, helps balance hormones and maintains weight - all fundamental cancer-prevention mechanisms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study in Cancer Cell International found physical activity may reduce the risk of colon cancer, which impacts about 107,000 people per year, by 23 percent when comparing people who exercise the most to those who exercise the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology suggested physical activity could prevent nearly 15 percent of colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For breast cancer, which will see about 320,000 new cases this year, a 2016 analysis published in the European Journal of Cancer found the most physically active women had a 12 to 21 percent lower risk than those who were least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2020 study in the British Journal of Cancer found women who reported the most exercise per week had a 23 percent decreased risk of breast cancer compared to those who exercised the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Diet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier said a clean and healthy diet can be crucial for reducing all types of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said if colon cancer runs in your family, avoiding processed meats like bacon, sausage and deli products can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet high in fiber, fruits, vegetables and whole grains has also been found to lower colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden echoed those sentiments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'If [a parent] had colon cancer, it's worth cutting back on processed meats... and even limiting red meat in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I tell my patients to lean into a fiber-rich diet... Your gut bacteria thrive on that, and over time, that supports a healthier colon.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, both experts said no food is a magic bullet, but the Mediterranean diet 'gets a lot of praise for a reason'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes 'lots of plant-based foods, healthy fats like olive oil, lean proteins and fewer processed snacks or sugary drinks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors agree that, 'Basically, if it grew from the ground, it’s probably good for you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12471615/DR-MICHAEL-MOSLEY-eating-olive-oil-nuts-fish-Living-like-Med-good.html"&gt;said a 'Mediterranean-type diet abundant in the plants is the gold standard - packed with vegetables, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and lean proteins like fish.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Minimize ultra-processed foods, sugars and alcohol. Foods high in phytonutrients, such as berries, cruciferous vegetables, turmeric and green tea also may be protective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight are also two factors to consider when trying to cut your familial cancer risk, Dr Messier said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map from the Environmental Protection Agency. It shows radon levels across the country, which reveal 25% of Americans live in areas where levels are considered unsafe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier told the Mail that even if you have never smoked, a close family member who was a smoker and was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer could still put you at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung cancer is estimated to affect about 227,000 people in 2025, with 124,000 deaths. People exposed to secondhand smoke have a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both doctors advise quitting smoking, avoiding secondhand smoke and steering clear of all tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also urge people to avoid other toxins - particularly radon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier and Dr McFadden recommend testing your home for radon, a radioactive gas that has no color, smell or taste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gas - which comes from the natural decay of uranium, a radioactive element found in nearly all soils - is present in both indoor and outdoor air and there is no known safe level of exposure to the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14305279/map-radioactive-gas-hotspots-linked-cancer.html"&gt;radon exposure is the second most common cause of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US after smoking, leading to about 21,000 deaths each year, according to the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Angelina Jolie (pictured) had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after testing positive for a gene that increases breast and ovarian cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Genetic testing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charles Oyesile, a medical research physician, told the Daily Mail people with a family history of cancer should consult with an oncologist and genetics counselor to assess their individualized risk given their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing can help determine the best course of action - whether that is undergoing genetic testing to see if you are a carrier of any cancer-related genes, or starting cancer screenings at an earlier age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While genetic tests won't prevent cancer, they can tell you if you are at a heightened risk, which could help you make certain life choices - such as exercising more, quitting smoking, following a cleaner diet or undergoing certain preventative procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the BRCA genes, a blood test can identify genetic variants in the APC gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tumor suppressor gene is crucial for preventing the development of colon cancer. Mutations in the APC gene can lead to familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable condition that causes polyps in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, in turn, raises the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden said, 'In some cases, a genetic test can tell us which screenings you actually need and when.

These blood-sucking insects are spreading across the United States of America, and carrying a sneaky parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, the culprit behind Chagas disease. Often overlooked, this disease can lead to serious cardiac and intestinal troubles down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now reports kissing bugs in 32 states, and human cases have popped up in several, including California and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kissing bugs and Chagas: What’s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite T. cruzi, typically transmitted when an infected kissing bug bites and then defecates near the entrance site. If you accidentally rub feces into the bite, eyes, or mouth, the parasite can sneak in. Symptoms in the early (acute) stage are often mild or unnoticeable; think fever, fatigue, headache, or eyelid swelling (the hallmark “Romaña’s sign”). But many cases go undiagnosed until the chronic phase, years later, when a frightening 20–30% can develop serious heart problems like heart failure or arrhythmias, or digestive issues. Antiparasitic treatments exist, but they’re most effective early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which US states are affected?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs (scientists call them triatomine insects) have now been reported across 32 states, with human cases confirmed in eight, including California, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, most sightings happen in the Sierra Nevada foothills, Los Angeles, and San Diego deserts, where wild mammals (opossums, raccoons, rats) thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key pointers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;32 states have documented kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human infections confirmed in at least eight states: California, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;California: Especially bugs in Southern California are carrying T. cruzi, with infections noted in Los Angeles and San Diego counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas: The state has become a hotspot, with 50 locally acquired human cases (2013-2023), dogs in certain kennels showing up to 31% infection rates, and kissing bugs testing positive in 30-50% of samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern states in general: Due to abundant wildlife and suitable ecological conditions, these states are seeing more kissing bug activity. Wildlife like raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and others help sustain the parasite cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Chagas disease spread?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kissing bug bites, often around the face, and then drops infected feces near the wound. If you scratch or touch it, the dangerous parasite Trypanosoma cruzi enters your body. It can also spread via contaminated blood, organ transplants, or mother-to-baby transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms to watch out for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chagas has two phases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acute phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often mild or unnoticed.

They have a pointed, cone-shaped head and long, thin legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fortify your home:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seal cracks and crevices around doors, windows, and walls. Install sturdy screens and keep outdoor lighting to a minimum at night. Keep pet sleeping areas clean; bugs often get in via dirty or pet-filled spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Handle bugs safely:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never touch kissing bugs with your bare hands. Instead, trap them carefully using gloves and a container, and then contact local health or pest control authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor symptoms and get tested:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you experience unexplained fever, fatigue, swollen eyelids, or other unusual signs, especially if bitten by a bug, see a doctor and ask about Chagas. Blood tests can confirm infection; early antiparasitic treatment (like benznidazole or nifurtimox) can clear the parasite if caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protect pets and loved ones:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pregnant women or those receiving blood transfusions should be extra cautious, as Chagas disease can be transmitted congenitally or through contaminated blood/organs. Additionally, dogs are common victims, especially in kennels, and can even become reservoirs, passing the parasite back into the bug population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Coronavirus outbreak: How to protect yourself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 01:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAJBVV95cUxQSXQtZS1sbk9UX29qZm43WDlRV3RybU5QWGRvTTk2X0U4N3lWcTlMSVNTZnExOEVYbjNBaGZ5MnpHMlhHT0ZkOHh2Zl9ld2xpcVhQNTBVZUR6Z2V4RFZVSGkwaEtVTmR6bUJxM2pfdlN2ZnNSWXI3b2FpYm0wdUNzeHRSUU45M2lSOE1oM3ZLOS1JZGZfMDlzSTlCMnpJVlFVWWxFV1ZhSXlpdXRsc0Q2YWo3RmhabXJoMnhaOVNVT0JLbjVjMHlYMU1Tb1UyOHJZUmtKdURZNWJidERvdlJpOWF0YlRrSzBueEgtTV81Z3RrNGxScHpHNmhPWjBhS09ZUnFaSnZvVlZnWGNJS2N1b3E2S2hTbUNVZzhqMkR1bWhnbVh3ZjE2c3RHdzYyX29LX3REZFViUG4</guid></item><item><title>含糖饮料改变肠道DNA ，但Technion研究发现效果可以逆转-研究-耶路撒冷邮报</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/nutrition/article-866545</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="menu-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM POST EN ESPANOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="arrow "&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path stroke="#CB133E" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" d="m5.335 13.333 5.333-5.334-5.333-5.333"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:23:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SS0U2MjVqUUhQaVEzR3Fhb3lnZTFhaVRpWElXRDBVSlFXajVKR0VVTTJEanlPVHZHaHlUWXdDdlVvc2lIVi1VQVdsM2pKNVdtSElTYzE3aXVOdTN5UGVYekxCZDI3R3gzVGVNODhwZ21haE1L</guid></item><item><title>卡通：骨刺科- Daily Kos</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/6/2341987/-Cartoon-Department-of-bone-spurs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__details"&gt;

Another Reddit post showed a similar digital billboard being towed across the water, also just off the Florida coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's not just beaches, either. Whether you're stuck in traffic, pumping gas, or just going to school, you could now potentially be inundated with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, money spent on advertising in the United States increased 5.6% over 2023 to an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethannkaminkow/2024/04/21/as-ad-spend-rises-marketing-budgets-switch-to-commerce/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$360 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$360 billion&lt;/a&gt; — and that doesn't even include political advertising. All that comes with a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Advertising pushes an overall culture of consumerism, where people strive to get the best and latest products. Companies, in turn, create more and more products to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-manufacturer-carbon-emissions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manufacturing and production sector;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;manufacturing and production sector&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for roughly 20% of global carbon pollution, and more than half of the world's energy usage. It also contributes greatly to the trillions of pieces of plastic that pollute our planet and waterways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Purpose Disruptors, a London-based organization dedicated to advertising, created a metric called "&lt;a href="https://www.purposedisruptors.org/advertised-emissions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advertised emissions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;advertised emissions&lt;/a&gt;", which measures the carbon pollution that results from increased sales due to advertising.

						&lt;p&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was found at a Wake County high school, just several weeks into the new schoolyear, according to a Wake County spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County, in an email, told WRAL that they were notified that a person with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville High School sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county is working with the Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with the person. Those people will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We are working to find out how many people might have been affected by this case. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease that affects the lungs or other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys or spine. It is spread through the air when someone with TB coughs, sneezes, sings or speaks, according to county's website. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB is not spread by shaking hands, kissing, sharing glasses, plates, utensils, clothing, sheets or furniture. While TB can be spread when someone coughs or sneezes, it cannot be spread throughout the air outside. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB symptoms may include: &lt;/p&gt;

The condition, known as a subconjunctival hemorrhage, occurs when a tiny blood vessel bursts beneath the clear surface layer covering the white part of the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="fpgod-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fpgod-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fpgod-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This type of bleeding is typically painless, doesn’t affect vision and clears up on its own within a few days to two weeks.

Long-term use of eye drops, especially for glaucoma, can also irritate and damage delicate blood vessels.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="74bbc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="74bbc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="74bbc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;On the other hand, internal causes are related to systemic conditions affecting the body’s vascular system — not just the eye. One of the most significant is high blood pressure, which makes blood vessels more fragile and prone to rupture, even under minor strain. Blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, warfarin or other anticoagulants can also reduce clotting ability, making even a small eye bleed appear more prominent and last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="6pc0f-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.rygGumN9qel" id="image_ArticleImageData.rygGumN9qel"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rygGumN9qel" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/08/25/r15WaoFtll/r15WaoFtll_0_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מערכת כלי הדם" title="The body’s vascular system  (Photo: Shuttertstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rygGumN9qel" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/08/25/r15WaoFtll/r15WaoFtll_0_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מערכת כלי הדם" title="The body’s vascular system  (Photo: Shuttertstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;The body’s vascular system &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shuttertstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="6j2cg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6j2cg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6j2cg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;There are also everyday situations that can suddenly spike venous pressure in the body, such as coughing, sneezing, vomiting, lifting heavy objects or even straining due to constipation. In these scenarios, abdominal pressure rises, veins expand and stretch and a tiny blood vessel in the eye’s conjunctiva may burst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="7j83g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7j83g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7j83g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“When you increase abdominal pressure, the veins become more engorged, and small vessels can rupture,” Dr. Shulman says. In most cases, she emphasizes, the hemorrhage itself is not a sign of a serious condition — unless it recurs frequently, in which case it’s important to evaluate for any underlying systemic illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="4n03s-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4n03s-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4n03s-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The main symptom of a subconjunctival hemorrhage is the sudden appearance of a red or dark patch on the white of the eye. Despite its alarming look, it is usually painless and doesn’t affect vision or cause swelling. In some cases, people may feel a mild foreign-body sensation or itchiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="dtug3-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="cur6s-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cur6s-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cur6s-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Most people don’t even notice it until they look in the mirror or someone else points it out,” says Dr. Shulman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="n27j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="n27j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="n27j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Typically, the hemorrhage clears on its own within one to two weeks, much like a bruise on the skin. The color fades gradually — from red to orange and yellow — before disappearing completely. No medical treatment is required, though lubricating eye drops may help ease any discomfort. It’s important to avoid rubbing the eye or exposing it to further irritation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="13cam-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="13cam-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13cam-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Who is most at risk?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13cam-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;A study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="BJCry11m4i9eg" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3702240/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13cam-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Clinical Ophthalmology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13cam-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; found that in healthy young individuals, the condition is usually benign and linked to local causes such as strain, minor trauma or dryness. In contrast, in older adults, it may indicate systemic vascular issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes or atherosclerosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="1n9rr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1n9rr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1n9rr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Shulman confirms this trend: “It’s generally more common in older people.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4nufq-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While wearing contact lenses doesn’t directly cause bleeding, excessive handling or rubbing when inserting or removing lenses can lead to irritation and broken blood vessels. Maintaining proper hygiene and correct lens use reduces the risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="a0j33-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a0j33-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a0j33-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;When should you see a doctor?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a0j33-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In most cases, a subconjunctival hemorrhage resolves on its own and doesn’t require medical attention. However, medical evaluation is advised if the red patch doesn’t fade within two to three weeks; it is accompanied by pain, discharge, swelling or changes in vision; it occurs repeatedly; or the individual is taking blood thinners or has a known bleeding disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="4hon8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4hon8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4hon8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The bleeding itself isn’t dangerous,” Dr. Shulman stresses, “but sometimes it signals another issue, like poorly controlled hypertension. That’s why I always recommend checking blood pressure and ruling out internal causes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="1jmtu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1jmtu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1jmtu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She also emphasizes the importance of distinguishing a visible subconjunctival hemorrhage from more serious internal eye bleeds, such as in the vitreous or retina. These may not be visible externally but can cause blurred or distorted vision and require immediate medical treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="7vh5q" data-offset-key="34ae9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="34ae9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="34ae9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How to reduce your risk
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="34ae9-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While it’s not always possible to prevent tiny eye vessel ruptures, a few basic precautions can help lower the likelihood: Keep blood pressure and diabetes well controlled, avoid excessive physical strain, use contact lenses correctly and hygienically, maintain good eye hygiene and refrain from rubbing your eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 22:23:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9tUFl6WkZnVzJSNl80Nm5MQkcyVEF5YXYtNXl5eWVzM21HWFFVUU5JMlphcnJNLS1MbFpua0dzN0U3OUxVcXRWZnZqcGN5QzNJQ3oxcF82T3hkcjA5bXN1dDdiYWRhRWFoOUE</guid></item><item><title>改革本身与在会议上提出新冠肺炎索赔的医生的距离- bbc.com</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z4rd87nlo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Reform UK has distanced itself from a conference speaker who suggested that Covid vaccines were linked to the King's and the Princess of Wales' cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Aseem Malholtra, an adviser to US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, said: "One of Britain's most eminent oncologists Professor Angus Dalgleish said to me to share with you today that he thinks it's highly likely that the Covid vaccines have been a significant factor in the cancers in the royal family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said that it was "shockingly irresponsible" of Reform to allow Dr Malholtra at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The party said that it "does not endorse what he said but does believe in free speech".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In his speech in Birmingham, at an event titled "Make Britain Healthy Again", Dr Malholtra also claimed that studies show that mRNA vaccines could alter genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Malhotra, a cardiologist, also said taking the Covid vaccine was more likely to cause harm than the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is highly likely that not a single person should have been injected with this," he added, before going on to say that the World Health Organization had been "captured" by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and urged for it to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He hit out at health minister Stephen Kinnock, who called Dr Malhotra an "anti-vax conspiracy theorist".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the stage, he asked the audience: "Have you heard anything anti-vax or conspiracy theory so far here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Malholtra's views have been discredited by many medical professionals and are not supported by scientific evidence, and the NHS says that Covid vaccines meet all strict safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The link between the Covid jab and cancer has previously been dismissed by academics and oncologists after claims it had led to "turbo cancers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Brian Ferguson, professor of viral immunology at the University of Cambridge, accused Dr Malholtra of repeating an "outlandish conspiracy theory only serves to undermine the credibility of those spreading it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He continued: "There is no credible evidence that these vaccines disrupt tumour suppressors or drive any kind of process that results in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is particularly crass to try to link this pseudoscience to the unfortunate incidents of cancer in the royal family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The King's cancer diagnosis was first announced in February 2024.

                &lt;p&gt;With some states thinking about removing vaccine mandates, Maryland will protect access to vaccines for all of its residents with flu season approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland residents can go to their providers and pharmacies to get their vaccinations, and get advice on what types of vaccines to get to protect themselves from viruses and illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends to those 6 years and older to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes in the midst of the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/08/fda-approves-updated-pfizer-covid-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration approving updated COVID-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which is limited for some kids and adults with one high-risk health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The federal government’s rapid changes and unnecessary swirl around vaccine policy is harmful for Marylanders and all Americans, and could result in disastrous public health outcomes,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore added that the state is prepared to deal with the challenges of federal vaccine guidance with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. trying to advance anti-vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The health, safety and well-being of Marylanders and their loved ones are our North Star, and we will do everything in our power to ensure they have access to life-saving medicines like vaccines,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts is following Maryland’s playbook in protecting &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/states-move-to-protect-vaccines-in-the-face-of-attempts-to-remove-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccine access for its residents&lt;/a&gt;, despite Florida being on the verge of being the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/florida-will-work-to-eliminate-all-childhood-vaccine-mandates-in-the-state-officials-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first state to to get rid of school vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 8 in 10 U.S. adults said kids should be vaccinated to go to school, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/what-polls-show-about-americans-views-on-childhood-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a Harvard/SSRS poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines continue to be one of the most powerful public health tools for safeguarding our people and communities against disease,” Maryland Department of Health Secretary Dr. Meena Seshamani said.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say the problem is related to a lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reality was never clearer than Thursday at the Denver Public Library, where &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-denver-health-exhibit-aims-to-break-addiction-stigma-during-national-recovery-month" target="_blank"&gt;an exhibit aimed at breaking substance use stigma&lt;/a&gt; became the setting for a life-saving rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the customers of the library came and was talking to some of our staff, and then sat down in the library and fell asleep, but we heard some snoring, and people were checking in on him,” said Brooke Bender, administrative director at Denver Health’s Center for Addiction Medicine. “Eventually, we didn't hear anything else, and the library social worker had stopped by to check on him. They seemed to have known him, that he was a regular visitor of the library.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man became unresponsive, Bender and peer-support specialists acted quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She couldn't get him to respond, and so we jumped into action, and we had the naloxone there at the table as part of our booth, and grabbed that and were able to bring him back,” Bender said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, library staff called 911, and Denver Health paramedics rushed the man to the emergency department, where he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saved his life. It was a surprising event that we didn't expect to happen when we were there, sharing pictures and stories of people in recovery,” Bender said. “But it was a powerful reminder that what we're doing really matters, and that this can happen anywhere at any time, and that all of us can be responsible for saving a life if we have naloxone at our fingertips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bender, the lesson is simple: “Having naloxone with you, even if you don't use substances yourself, gives you the opportunity to support someone else who might need that help. There should be no stigma about taking naloxone whenever you have the opportunity, so that you can carry it and save a life if you need to, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How naloxone works and why community access matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is simple to use and does not require medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You do not need to be a medical professional to use this,” Bender said. “Many of the people that we've talked to in the community this week, when we were sharing our 'Stories in Black and White' exhibit, said that they've saved several of their friends and family's lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using naloxone is very straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Naloxone comes in an easy-to-open package. If you just tear off the packaging, there's no cover for the nasal spray. I just took the nasal spray and took it to the person's nose when they're lying down, and put it in one of their nostrils and squeezed,” she explained. “We wait for two to three minutes to see if that's taken effect, if there's any response, if the heart's beating, and check for signs of stability, and if there are none, then you take another dose and put it in the other nostril and spray.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Denver Health created a video demonstrating how to administer naloxone. You can watch it in the video player below&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="HtmlModule"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bender, expired naloxone can still work and should not be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Expired naloxone can still work and should be used. We should not be throwing away expired naloxone that can still save someone's life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking down barriers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2025.00263" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety&lt;/a&gt; highlights ongoing disparities in naloxone access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study looked at the different steps it takes to go from someone becoming aware that naloxone is a thing, that it can help, to them having it on their person when it would be necessary,” said Dr. Joshua Black, senior statistical research scientist. “The main takeaway is that the disparity persists. Disparities have to be addressed all along that pathway in various ways that we can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black said cultural context is key to outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We cited some other research in our study showing that with Hispanic groups, just taking something that was written for English and translating it to Spanish isn't enough, because the way that things are said needs to be culturally meaningful to that group,” he said. “Engaging with individuals who are part of the community, who are peers, would enable whatever is developed to resonate more effectively with that community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, stigma remains a major obstacle, not only in seeking help but in carrying naloxone. Black argues for new distribution strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So moving out of a healthcare out of a retail setting and having harm reduction present where people are, rather than having them come to where the medicine is, would be another way to get over the stigma," Black said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A message of preparedness and hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Bender and Denver Health, the work goes well beyond emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's important to just be prepared and to really know how to use it and be prepared to use it,” Bender said. “In a crisis, it can feel a little jarring, and so it's good to have some repetitive practice… all those steps over and over, just to have it fresh in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of peer support is also clear, especially for those experiencing these situations for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This just goes to show the value of people who have lived expertise and the role that they can play in helping folks that may not have experience with that know what to do in that situation,” Bender said. “We know these things are working, and we just need to expand access."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextModule"&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing recently in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/em&gt;, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, the study found that patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer who consumed high levels of sucralose had worse response to immunotherapy and poorer survival than those with diets low in the artificial sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, supplements that boosted levels of the amino acid arginine mitigated the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy in mice, an approach that could now be tested in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to say, 'Stop drinking diet soda,' but when patients are being treated for cancer, they are already dealing with enough, so asking them to drastically alter their diet may not be realistic," said lead author Abby Overacre, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Immunology at Pitt and UPMC Hillman. "We need to meet patients where they are. That's why it's so exciting that arginine supplementation could be a simple approach to counteract the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Diwakar Davar, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Pitt and a medical oncologist and hematologist at UPMC Hillman, collaborating with Overacre and their team, used mouse models to show that the negative impacts of sucralose are driven by disruption to gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucralose shifted the composition of the mouse gut microbiome, increasing bacterial species that degrade arginine, which reduced levels of this amino acid in the blood, tumor fluid and stool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies such as anti-PD1 work by ramping up T cell activity so that they can more effectively kill cancer cells. Arginine is essential for T cell function, especially in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When arginine levels were depleted due to sucralose-driven shifts in the microbiome, T cells couldn't function properly," said Overacre. "As a result, immunotherapy wasn't as effective in mice that were fed sucralose."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models of adenocarcinoma and melanoma, adding sucralose to the diet inhibited anti-PD1 therapy, leading to larger tumors and poorer survival. But when the researchers gave sucralose-fed mice arginine or citrulline, which is metabolized into arginine in the body, the effectiveness of immunotherapy was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the relevance of these findings for humans, the researchers looked at 132 patients with advanced melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer who received anti-PD1 therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients filled out detailed diet history questionnaires that included questions about how often they consumed artificial sweeteners in coffee, tea and diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that sucralose impeded the effectiveness of immunotherapies across a range of cancer types, stages and treatment modalities," said Davar. "These observations raise the possibility of designing prebiotics, such as targeted nutrient supplementation for patients who consume high levels of sucralose."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to launch a clinical trial investigating whether citrulline supplements -- which boost arginine levels more than arginine itself -- affect the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immune response in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7953165/easy-high-protein-high-fiber-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-Protein, High-Fiber Dinners That Are Easy to Make&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 332 to 478 calories, while the lunches span 379 to 596 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_125-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-health-benefits-of-a-high-protein-high-fiber-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_126-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Health Benefits of a High-Protein, High-Fiber Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_127-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is found in every cell in our body. Because of this, it’s essential for countless bodily functions like bone and muscle health, digestion and energy production. While most people get enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-protein-11790921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, certain factors like activity level, age or health goals may amp up your needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_128-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_129-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the flip side, diets that are too high in protein can sometimes lack fiber, which may lead to digestive troubles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Striking the right balance of both protein and fiber is key to keeping your body healthy and running smoothly. Fiber brings its own powerful set of benefits. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to healthier weight loss and long-term weight control, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, reduced odds of certain cancers, more regular bowel movements and even a longer life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_130-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_131-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together, protein and fiber help you feel full and satisfied after meals, support digestion and keep your energy steady throughout the day. Talk about a winning combo for health and well-being!

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Five states reported local cases of animal and human bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease begins with "absent or mild and non-specific symptoms" like fevers, headaches, enlarged glands, muscle pain, and chest pain as the parasites flow through the bloodstream, per the&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; World Health Organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, early symptoms could include "purplish swelling of the lids of one eye" or a skin lesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms get much more intense the longer the parasites remain in the body, largely collecting in the heart and digestive muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One to three decades after infection, up to a third of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 1 in 10 suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations," the website read. "In later years these patients may experience the damage to the nervous system and muscles of the heart and digestive system, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, progressive heart failure, and sudden death, among other clinical manifestations and complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is treatable, but is much more effective in the early stages of infection. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" target="_blank" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the disease may become untreatable if it becomes chronic, at which point the only option is treating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 18:44:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgJBVV95cUxQTE9vaWt6NE9CekVVOE4xLXdzSk85OHhoWFlvU0ZSZlNtZGNpQ0VubHplWm5uenNSTVltUmJSV3dvRVFVQ0ZCSElzWkZCdzlmT0FsQkZrNzlQRDFvS3FwMHZPSWFGeEpUMXA0RnNaMDFNX2tRaHV2a013NW5ydVc5VDZoc3N1Vm5hWFExZzdvVm1lUUFPNWFzOS1KQXRWLVUxenpERW4xV2hOVWJJaURoNmE1eXptbWRTN0pCbUdPbVljaExRb3VPRFUyMjFtemdfZzBDaDBudEVGdGVfN1lUV0tEbmpPVG9EMmthdnJRSjBONkhoWVR2NXpSM3ZsTlRlemZ0T2tDWmdITldmcUJkV0hNS195VjBZUUlNMjV6Y3Z0SUk4ZXM0YmVONTcwVE90OG8xSXpiTjI4THNYZkxESzg0cnRfSDAwRFBaVTJR</guid></item><item><title>如果您使用人工智能进行治疗，以下是专家推荐的5件事-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/06/ai-chatbots-therapy-tips/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JOLKNZK2FFHTJHJUGLV4KGUPPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many people are turning to generative artificial intelligence for answers to work or school questions.
