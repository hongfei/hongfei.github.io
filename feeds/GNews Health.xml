Do you ever lay in bed at night overthinking all of the embarrassing things you've done since childhood? Same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As you're tracing this infinity symbol, you're going to just follow it with you eyes — only your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What this does is activate your vestibular center which is involved with your balance and eye movements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Joe Whittington, a US-based emergency room medic, taking control of your eye movement by focusing on a single object can help restore calm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-d019c940-15ff-11f0-aa7e-e9a6ec605a7c"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; the vestibular system — located within the inner ear — is stimulated by movement up or down, backward or forwards, and around or over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Focusing on gentle, slow and predictable movements are just one of the techniques, the health service suggests to calm a sensitive vestibular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the method isn't a replacement for professional support, many praised Dr Whittington's advice to ease the nightly onslaught of overthinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Didn’t realize why I did this.. but it makes sense now,' one &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-d01d4bb0-15ff-11f0-aa7e-e9a6ec605a7c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; user said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others also compared it to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, a psychological treatment that's been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s almost the same thing as EMDR. Science behind it is fascinating!', another wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'DIY EMDR therapy,' a second said, with a third adding: 'Sounds like the same science behind EMDR therapy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EMDR is recommended by NHS watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to help treat PTSD alongside other talking therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep deprivation can lead to obesity, memory loss, diabetes, heart disease, heightened and unstable emotions, impaired ability to learn and a reduced immune response, leaving you vulnerable to disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the method isn't a replacement for professional support, many praised Dr Whittington's advice to ease the nightly onslaught of overthinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It uses one of two ways to process memories — moving your eyes from side to side or tapping from side to side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is believed to stimulate either side of your brain in an alternating left-right fashion to help you access your subconscious mind and process what is stored in there and how it affects you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People often take around 10 to 20 minutes normally to nod off after turning off the lights, the Sleep Foundation say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year, a study found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that around one in six Brits suffer insomnia, yet 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The poll of 2,000 people, by The Sleep Charity, found nine in ten experience some sort of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behaviours when unable to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c8412070-d4c2-11ef-a087-8dda3d723b5a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, stroke and infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which figures suggest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-13345721/Do-undiagnosed-sleep-disorder-Warning-14million-Brits-unknowingly-living-condition-prove-dangerous-cost-NHS-billions.html"&gt;affects up to 14million Brits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, sleep deprivation takes its own toll, from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e4b36540-d983-11ef-bf36-47316f776e33"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-d5cba4c0-15f1-11f0-856d-25ce04a1124c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;HOW MUCH SLEEP SHOULD YOU GET?

During spring/summer try sleeping with your bedroom window open to reduce the temperature and increase ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;5) Limit alcohol in the evenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you might initially fall into deep sleep more easily, you then wake up frequently during the night and have poorer deep sleep overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;6) Supplement vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D plays a role in sleep. Vitamin D is widely available online and from most pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are unsure if this is appropriate or how much you need, seek advice from your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;7) Ensure sufficient intake of magnesium and zinc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods high in magnesium include spinach, kale, avocado, bananas, cashews, and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods high in zinc include meat, oysters, crab, cheese, cooked lentils, and dark chocolate (70%+).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 11:39:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNelpoQW1JQ1FxenYxcmNDRHlZaUxwdE9aSVNPemp1NDl3OEItYTdsN3N5Qld1YzN6VTlNZlhYS255ZklEaEVjTUdiSjgxN2lGRXEtUGZEMkhwci14QTdRU1FnWHlwek5YT3hHdXhwb3QyZjlwcEhQazRfYXV3cVNMUnhrVVdjVjc2d01QREd1a3ZEdlJpa1loZGJpWGN2Mzh6MjM0VlZpT3NNUkN6RU9leEJlMlJfQ1BQ0gG-AUFVX3lxTE5OV1BMME9SdGNxdTJWNlV1Vnk3SElBMXluTUhXNGZvQS1RNExqdVUtMXp0N2lUcTM4QUpyMGtCbkZfSzNjdUVobXloRGtFeWNkYWhFOWRDQkIxRllzeUFjVmhXeGU2aGtLZnpsU2pqUkozcmFXWnp6eFNfZTJZMVNEZ2JhWHZKeTVFNFJKeGFiZl9LMHRxX2FENlB2MVFZZHJOaEJ0WGZxNXlQUGtIMGtVc1R0d1BxZ0RmMnRNLXc</guid></item><item><title>MAHA Turns on RFK Jr. Over Measles Vaccine Stance - WSJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZmRITnBTOGkzX1BYZW1IdkpiVEFsY0dWODlOYXhoaUhFUE54dFRoaDl5aFY1ZW9hV04waEpYcWZtQzRIZ01SeTFta3YycEctTlFPYnV4VUxHWHBzakpLNlQ1c1VCanZCUWZBRW5sbGhqYThIOHNQd2ZBcTZJaGpxaXdoMTh0MzB6SFNwN3FLR1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSJ</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZmRITnBTOGkzX1BYZW1IdkpiVEFsY0dWODlOYXhoaUhFUE54dFRoaDl5aFY1ZW9hV04waEpYcWZtQzRIZ01SeTFta3YycEctTlFPYnV4VUxHWHBzakpLNlQ1c1VCanZCUWZBRW5sbGhqYThIOHNQd2ZBcTZJaGpxaXdoMTh0MzB6SFNwN3FLR1o</guid></item><item><title>5 Science-Backed Longevity ‘Hacks’ That Don’t Cost a Fortune - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1hNjhyRUY5NEw5bDV3cFpReEtOTUJQRThDdFZTX0xjZENDOXZ3ZldTU1dDZ2hEdl9hcXc4aVNYOVdVdF9KWUtxcHN1ck1FSXFWT0RCdGlISFRpd1ZtR3dMcjlOUkl3T0ZIV2NmNlpJQmFGSm1QZjBr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Private &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/well/longevity-health-clinics.html" title=""&gt;$20,000 health clinics&lt;/a&gt; offering genome sequencing and full-body scans.

One-on-one sleep coaching and $300 wearables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Pursuing “longevity” has become an expensive — not to mention time-consuming — hobby. But it doesn’t have to be: Experts say many of the practices that are most likely to extend your life are also the cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Simple lifestyle choices, like eating well and getting regular exercise, are by far “the most effective and well-supported” longevity tactics — and “nothing else comes close,” said John Tower, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The influencer-backed supplement stacks, oxygen treatments and stem cell therapies for longevity are “experimental at best,” added Joseph Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab. If you’re looking to live longer and healthier, you’re better off doing “what science and history have confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are some of the experts’ suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-16863476"&gt;Work out. It doesn’t matter where.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;High-end gyms might have personal trainers and fancy biometric measurements to track your heart rate and blood oxygen levels. But it’s the exercise itself that’s proven to extend your health and life spans, and you can get the same physical benefits by working out on your own, said Roger Fielding, a senior scientist at the U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Cardio exercise and strength training are both linked to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;lower mortality&lt;/a&gt; because they reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Just walking 30 minutes per day around your neighborhood can significantly reduce your risk; so can doing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/well/move/strength-exercises-aging.html" title=""&gt;higher intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt; or resistance training using dumbbells at home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (like walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise (like running or swimming) to prevent cardiovascular disease.

                One-year-old River Jacobs is held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, while he receives an MMR vaccine from Raynard Covarrubio, at a vaccine clinic held by the Lubbock Public Health Department on March 1 in Lubbock, Texas. A measles outbreak in West Texas has led to more than 500 cases, 57 hospitalizations and the deaths of two school-age children.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;More than a dozen vaccination clinics were canceled in Pima County, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So was a media blitz to bring low-income children in Washoe County, Nevada, up to date on their shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Planned clinics were also scuttled in&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144" target="_blank"&gt; Texas&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0vE9f_0Gdo" target="_blank"&gt; Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/vaccine-clinics-canceled-health-jobs-cut-as-feds-rescind-grants-to-wa" target="_blank"&gt; Washington&lt;/a&gt;, among other places.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunization efforts across the country were upended after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hhs-covid-pandemic-trump-cdc-309fedec9383dc4fdacba6e9ca2b5309" target="_blank"&gt; abruptly canceled $11.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in COVID-related funds for state and local health departments in late March.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A federal judge&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.59214/gov.uscourts.rid.59214.54.0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;temporarily blocked the cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week in some states, including Arizona, after a group of state Attorneys General sued. In addition, many of the organizations that receive the funds said they must proceed as though they're gone. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;All the disruption is raising public health concerns amid a resurgence of measles, a rise in vaccine hesitancy, and growing distrust of public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm particularly concerned about the accessibility of vaccines for vulnerable populations," former U.S. surgeon general Jerome Adams told KFF Health News. Adams served in President Donald Trump's first administration. "Without high vaccination rates, we are setting those populations and communities up for preventable harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the CDC, does not comment on ongoing litigation, spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said. But she sent a statement on the original action, saying that HHS made the cuts because the COVID pandemic is over: "HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But clinics have also used the money to address other preventable diseases such as flu, mpox, and measles. More than&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt; 500 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far in a Texas outbreak have led to 57 hospitalizations and the deaths of two school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Pima County, Arizona, officials learned that one of its vaccination programs would have to end early because the federal government&lt;a href="https://pima.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=13988956&amp;amp;GUID=E544CB0E-E898-4719-A72D-98DB8EB90410" target="_blank"&gt; took away&lt;/a&gt; its remaining $1 million in grant money. The county had to cancel about 20 vaccine events offering COVID and flu shots that it had already scheduled, said Theresa Cullen, director of the county health department. And it isn't able to plan any more, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The county is home to Tucson, the second-largest city in Arizona. But it also has sprawling rural areas, including part of the Tohono O'odham Nation, that are far from many health clinics and pharmacies, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The county used the federal grant to offer free vaccines in mostly rural areas, usually on the weekends or after usual work hours on weekdays, Cullen said. The programs are held at community organizations, during fairs and other events, or inside buses turned into mobile health clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Canceling vaccine-related grants has an impact beyond immunization rates, Cullen said. Vaccination events are also a chance to offer health education, connect people with other resources they may need, and build trust between communities and public health systems, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;County leaders knew the funding would run out at the end of June, but Cullen said the health department had been in talks with local communities to find a way to continue the events. Now "We've said, 'Sorry, we had a commitment to you and we're not able to honor it,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cullen said the health department won't restart the events even though a judge temporarily blocked the funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The vaccine equity grant is a grant that goes from the CDC to the state to us," she said. "The state is who gave us a stop work order."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The full effect of the CDC cuts is not yet clear in many places. California Department of Public Health officials estimated that grant terminations would result in at least $840 million in federal funding losses for its state, including $330 million used for virus monitoring, testing, childhood vaccines, and addressing health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are working to evaluate the impact of these actions," said California Department of Public Health Director&lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/meet-the-director" target="_blank"&gt; Erica Pan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Washoe County, Nevada, the surprise cuts in federal funding mean the loss of two contract staffers who set up and advertise vaccination events, including&lt;a href="https://dpbh.nv.gov/Programs/Immunization/School_and_Childcare/School_and_Child_Care_Immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt; state-mandated&lt;/a&gt; back-to-school immunizations for illnesses such as measles.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Our core team can't be in two places at once," said&lt;a href="https://www.nnph.org/about-us/leadership-team/lisa-lottritz.php" target="_blank"&gt; Lisa Lottritz&lt;/a&gt;, division director for community and clinical health services at Northern Nevada Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She expected to retain the contractors through June, when the grants were scheduled to sunset. The health district scrambled to find money to keep the two workers for a few more weeks. They found enough to pay them only through May.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lottritz immediately canceled a publicity blitz focused on getting children on government insurance up to date on their shots. Vaccine events at the public health clinic will go on, but are "very scaled back" with fewer staff members, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nurses who offer shots out and about at churches, senior centers, and food banks will stop that work in May, when the money to pay the contract workers runs out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The staff have other responsibilities. They do compliance visits, they're running our clinic, so I won't have the resources to put on events like that," Lottritz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The effect of the cancellations will reverberate for a long time, said&lt;a href="https://www.nnph.org/about-us/leadership-team/chad-kingsley.php" target="_blank"&gt; Chad Kingsley&lt;/a&gt;, district health officer for Northern Nevada Public Health, and it might take years for the full scope of decreasing vaccinations to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our society doesn't have a collective knowledge of those diseases and what they did," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles is top of mind in Missouri, where a conference on strengthening immunization efforts statewide was abruptly canceled due to the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Missouri Immunization Coalition, which organized the event for April 24-25, also had to lay off half its staff, according to board president Lynelle Phillips. The coalition, which coordinates immunization advocacy and education across the state, must now find alternative funding to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just cruel and unthinkably wrong to do this in the midst of a measles resurgence in the country," Phillips said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dana Eby, of the health department in New Madrid County, Missouri, had planned to share tips about building trust for vaccines in rural communities at the conference, including using school nurses and the&lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/wellness/immunizations/vfc-providers.php" target="_blank"&gt; Vaccines for Children program&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Madrid has one of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the state, despite being part of the largely rural "Bootheel" region that is often noted for its poor health outcomes. Over 98% of kindergartners in the county received the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella in 2023-24, compared with the statewide average of about 91%, and rates as low as 61% in some other Missouri counties.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I will say I think measles will be a problem before I retire," Eby, 42, said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also slated to speak at the Missouri event was former surgeon general Adams, who said he had planned to emphasize the need for community collaboration and the importance of vaccinations in protecting public health and reducing preventable diseases. He said the timing was especially pertinent given the explosion in measles cases in Texas and the rise in whooping cough cases and&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/health/whooping-cough-pertussis-louisiana/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; deaths in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can't make America healthy again by going backwards on our historically high U.S. vaccination rates," Adams said. "You can't die from chronic diseases when you're 50 if you've already died from measles or polio or whooping cough when you're 5."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;California correspondent Christine Mai-Duc contributed to this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt; KFF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By bringing together the latest evidence-based recommendations, the guidelines provide a critical tool for reducing deaths and disability caused by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite effective treatments and vaccines against some forms of meningitis, the disease remains a significant global health threat. Bacterial meningitis is the most dangerous form and can become fatal within 24 hours. Many pathogens can cause meningitis with an estimated 2.5 million cases reported globally in 2019. This includes 1.6 million cases of bacterial meningitis which resulted in approximately 240 000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 20% of people who contract bacterial meningitis develop long-term complications, including disabilities that impact quality of life. The disease also carries heavy financial and social costs for individuals, families, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial meningitis kills one in six of the people it strikes, and leaves many others with lasting health challenges," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Implementing these new guidelines will help save lives, improve long-term care for those affected by meningitis, and strengthen health systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis can affect anyone anywhere, and at any age, however the disease burden remains particularly high in low- and middle-income countries and in settings experiencing large-scale epidemics.  The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, often referred to as the ‘meningitis belt’, which is at high risk of recurrent epidemics of meningococcal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations for the clinical management of meningitis in children and adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving clinical management of meningitis is essential to reducing mortality and morbidity, minimizing long-term complications and disability, and improving quality of life for affected individuals and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of children over one month of age, adolescents, and adults with acute community-acquired meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They address all aspects of clinical care, including diagnosis, antibiotic therapy, adjunctive treatment, supportive care, and management of long-term effects.  Given the similarities in clinical presentation, diagnosis and management approaches across different forms of acute community-acquired meningitis, the guidelines address both bacterial and viral causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines provide recommendations for both non-epidemic and epidemic settings, the latter superseding previous 2014 WHO guidelines, which covered    &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/WHO-HSE-PED-CED-14.5"&gt;meningitis outbreak response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As resource-limited settings bear the highest burden of meningitis, these guidelines have been specifically developed to provide technical guidance suitable for implementation in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines are intended for use by health-care professionals in first- and second-level facilities, including emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services. Policymakers, health planners, academic institutions, and civil society organizations can also use them to inform capacity-building, education, and research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defeating meningitis by 2030&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines contribute to the broader   &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240026407"&gt;Defeating Meningitis by 2030&lt;/a&gt; Global Roadmap, adopted by WHO Member States in 2020, which aims to: eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics, reduce cases of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%, and reduce disability and improve quality of life after meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving these goals requires coordinated action across five key areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosis and treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Faster detection and optimal clinical management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention and epidemic control&lt;/strong&gt;: Developing new affordable vaccines, achieving high immunization and coverage, and improving outbreak preparedness and response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease surveillance: &lt;/strong&gt;Strengthening monitoring systems to guide prevention and control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care and support for those affected by meningitis: &lt;/strong&gt;Ensuring early recognition and improved access to care and support for after-effects from meningitis. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advocacy and engagement: &lt;/strong&gt;Increasing political commitment and inclusion in country plans, better public understanding of meningitis, and increased awareness of right to prevention, care and after-care services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these guidelines, WHO provides countries with a critical tool to close gaps in meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care, ensuring that more people receive timely treatment and long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

My team is working to uncover some of the mechanisms behind how alcohol increases cancer risk, including damage to immune cells and the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold health-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;How does alcohol cause cancer? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer occurs when cells grow uncontrollably in the body. Alcohol may lead to tumor formation by damaging DNA, causing mutations that disrupt normal cell division and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have identified several mechanisms associated with alcohol and cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon general report highlights four ways alcohol can cause cancer: alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, alterations in hormone levels, and interactions with other carcinogens such as tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down and eliminates alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When alcohol breaks down, its first byproduct is acetaldehyde, a chemical that is itself classified as a carcinogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have found certain genetic mutations can lead the body to break down alcohol faster, resulting in increased levels of acetaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also considerable evidence that alcohol can trigger the body to release harmful molecules called free radicals  that are associated with cell damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They damage DNA in a process called oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My lab has found that free radicals formed from alcohol consumption can directly affect how well cells make and break down proteins, resulting in abnormal proteins that promote inflammation and favors tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also affect hormone levels in ways that increase cancer risk. Moderate alcohol drinking can elevate estrogen levels, which can increase breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The substance also amplifies breast cancer risk by reducing levels of vitamin A, a compound that regulates estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people who both drink and smoke have an elevated risk of developing cancer of the mouth, pharynx and larynx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking by itself can cause inflammation and induce free radicals that damage DNA, and alcohol makes it easier for the body to absorb the carcinogens in cigarettes and vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;How much alcohol is safe? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may be wondering how much alcohol you can safely drink and avoid harm. If you ask clinicians and scientists, you might not like the answer: none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC and American dietary guidelines recommend consuming no more than one drink a day for women and no more than two drinks for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the surgeon general’s recent advisory have similar recommendations to limit alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol consumption is a highly preventable cause of cancer. However, there isn’t currently a way to determine someone’s personal cancer risk from alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each person’s individual genetic background, lifestyle, diet and other health factors can all influence the effects of alcohol on tumor formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, rethinking your alcohol drinking habits can help protect your health and reduce your cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'It goes against Big Pharma and it goes against traditional medicine. It is a tragedy because these are very effective therapies that can really improve the patient's outcome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marik, however, did not discourage standard treatments and said 'some of these [treatments] can be used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A month's worth of vitamin D supplements, depending on the dosage, can range from around $5 to $25 while omega-3 capsules cost about $20 to $40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is also naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and sardines, egg yolks, and fortified dairy, while fatty fish, edadame, and nuts all contain omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, a month's worth of chemotherapy drugs can range dramatically in price - from $1,000 to more than $12,000, depending on the type and insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, once someone is diagnosed with cancer, there is little evidence that supplements alone can help and traditional pharmaceutical therapies are lifesaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US oncology market reached $145.5 billion last year and is projected for a significant increase to $417 billion by 2034. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors such as a rising prevalence of cancer, advancements in precision medicine and increased demand for targeted therapies and immunotherapies are expected to boost the market in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion last year - majorly through sales of chemotherapy drug Keytruda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Analysis of blood samples revealed that during this time, omega-3 consumption 'turned back the clock' on biological age by up to four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion - majorly through sales of Keytruda, a chemotherapy treatment for various cancers like melanoma, lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their oncology division made about $2 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Pfizer brought in $64 billion last year which included sales of Xtandi - an oral medication used to treat certain types of advanced prostate cancer. Overall, their oncology department earned about $25 billion in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Established giants such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson also made about $88 billion in 2024 - mostly from sales of its multiple myeloma treatment Darzalex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The company's oncology sector generated $21 billion in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the University of Zurich study, published in Frontiers in Aging, found that it is possible to keep cancer from developing in the first place with simple lifestyle changes and avoid needing to spend thousands of dollars on medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from Zurich recruited 777 participants 70 years and older and split them into &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14354861/Researchers-supplement-slow-ageing-dementia-omega-3.html"&gt;different treatment groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some took a vitamin D tablet per day, some took a 1g tablet of omega-3 per day, some participated in a 30-minute home exercise program three times a week, and some did a combination over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fatty acids and omega-3 molecules in fish can reduce inflammation in the body help maintain blood vessels &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis of blood samples revealed that during this time, omega-3 consumption 'turned back the clock' on biological age by up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Heike Bischoff-Ferrari, one of the study's authors, said at the time: 'This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that the combination daily vitamin D3, supplemental marine omega-3s, and a simple home exercise program may be effective in the prevention of invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our results, although based on multiple comparisons and requiring replication, may prove to be beneficial for reducing the burden of cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining omega-3, a vitamin D supplement and exercise was found to have a slightly stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found these three interventions together had the biggest impact on lowering cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bischoff-Ferrari added: 'One of the most critical questions in the field of rejuvenation is whether a treatment exists that can effectively rejuvenate humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given the well-documented health benefits of omega-3, we explored whether it also influences the most reliable molecular markers of biological age – epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Slowing biological aging even to a small extent of three to four months across three years – as we saw in our study – is a good thing as, if sustained, it may have relevant effects on population health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the same trial, omega-3 reduced falls by 11 percent and infections by 13 percent, and in combination with vitamin D and exercise it reduced cancer risk by 61 percent and frailty by 39 percent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Professor Heike Bischoff-Ferrari, one of the 2022 study's authors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Paul Marik, a controversial physician who had his medical certification revoked for promoting ivermectin as a treatment for long Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that Vitamin D absorbed into the body through sunlight and supplements can help stave off tumors by regulating several genes that are responsible for cell reproduction and division - preventing the rapid multiplication of cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, the researchers theorized that high levels omega-3, found mostly in fish and nuts, as well as exercise can suppress inflammation, malignant cell reproduction and angiogenesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Angiogenesis is a process by which new blood vessels form from existing ones is crucial for tumor growth and spread because it allows tumors to access oxygen and nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation may trigger cancer by damaging DNA, past studies have noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The inflammatory process produces molecules called cytokines, which stimulate the growth of blood vessels that 'feed' tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, fatty acids and omega-3 molecules can reduce inflammation in the body and help maintain blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 03:36:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNdWJWSExiTDhob1k2ZjYyanh4X3FRMUg5NU9QbTdySGgyV19Ka3BGWkVwOXQwMVhlWnJhcGpCRE5nd21DUDZ4dzRQRTV4VFUzcDVXdG5taFZXMzF5dkQtY2FTVG1EYUtsT0NDSGxSdmVlQmIwekRGRlMtbG5hZEpTYndQclNjRkFWOU9wR0pJNVhWZ0ZpSktJcnNTMjZxNDR30gGmAUFVX3lxTFB0OUtrT2JDVklHallDcFlpcWxhMjhJUFZSNGxYV3ZDTlQ5aUswVDhnS3NtdWM0MmY2TGhuS0VQSVhQMHRZaFB2MmVqamRWS05FdGVTUnpZMmhSMXVGLURNa2dfM1BHY0hfamlQMm14WXN4R3lRQ0NGYXRLNFFQcnpvRW9IdHhHZENQSG8taGtkZXpNWGdNU1FndEtrNzRFWXhCTEJlWUE</guid></item><item><title>US Woman Experiences Periods For Over 1000 Days, Doctors Baffled By Bizarre Condition - NDTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxOcXcweklKMzVwSWtpdFhTZE1XWGU3dUNOcWsxdU1DOEVXVl9SYjZQdGlDdDBnTUtGTlQzUzJvcHpnV0xjRlNSbEhjUUpNNmd0N2pGU1hiT0NTX3B3Qkh3VFI0QnRkVFU1SFBKdERhMWlHUzBIdzVxakhxUDhRbU5vS1RtWlZDVzN1Z2hibE85end5X3U5dmpZZUVwNW8wSVh3clAweW0wYWNRa2hxNHAtODlUTmp2TGZzX25FQ2dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Art-exp_wr" id="ignorediv"&gt;
                                        
                                        &lt;p&gt;A TikTok user is sharing her harrowing experience with an unusually prolonged menstrual cycle that has lasted over 1,000 days. Despite consulting doctors, the cause of her condition remained a mystery until recently, when she finally discovered the underlying reason. "It was picked up on the very first ultrasound I had, and no one thought to mention it to me," Poppy revealed in a recent video.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual cycles typically follow a predictable pattern, but variations are common. For most women, menstrual bleeding occurs every 21 to 35 days and lasts between 2 to 7 days. However, this timeline can vary depending on factors such as age, hormones, birth control, and lifestyle factors like stress, diet, and exercise. According to the &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/abnormal-uterine-bleeding?utm_source=redirect&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=otn"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, 14% to 25% of US women of childbearing age experience irregular periods, characterised by irregular cycle length, flow, or frequency. While this is usually not a major concern, if irregular periods become persistent or are accompanied by symptoms like pelvic pain or heavy bleeding, it's best to consult a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's three-year period saga began with two weeks of continuous bleeding, prompting medical attention. Despite multiple doctor consultations, tests, and medication, the bleeding persisted. Cysts were discovered on her ovaries, but the cause remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My iron levels? Rock bottom. The cramps? Awful. All of my muscles hurt, my bones hurt. I have constant headaches, constant nausea," Poppy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's periods persisted for three months, despite a PCOS diagnosis. Doctors performed a hysteroscopy, but found no clear cause. A specialist prescribed new medication and inserted an IUD, which also failed to provide relief. Her frustration and desperation grew as she struggled with persistent bleeding for over a year, despite undergoing numerous tests and trying various treatments and medications. Even an MRI and ultrasound showed no underlying issues. The cycle of hope and disappointment took a toll on her mental health, plunging her into depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her breakthrough came on day 950 of her prolonged bleeding, when she discovered a possible cause with the help of her TikTok followers. She revealed that she has a rare condition called a bicornuate uterus, also known as a heart-shaped uterus, where the uterus is divided into two chambers instead of one. Interestingly, this detail was initially noted on her first ultrasound around the third or fourth month of bleeding, but its significance wasn't realised until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bicornuate uterus, a rare condition affecting less than 5% of women, can cause severe symptoms such as heavy and prolonged bleeding, painful periods, and pelvic discomfort. While many women with this condition remain asymptomatic, for those who experience symptoms, the impact can be significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have spent 950 days in absolute agony, spending my lifetime f—king savings on period pads and period products, on new trousers, on new underwear, on new sheets. I have cried every single day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find relief, Poppy is planning to undergo several procedures. She will have a comprehensive hormonal panel to test her hormone levels and have her IUD removed. She is also scheduled for a dilation and curettage procedure, where doctors will scrape away abnormal tissue from her uterine lining. Furthermore, she is exploring surgery with her doctor to correct her heart-shaped uterus, a condition that may be the root cause of her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about a life where I'm not going to be bleeding every single day is heaven," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, recommended the measles vaccine and said he was “not familiar” with sweeping cuts to state and local public health programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The conversation was taped shortly after his visit to West Texas, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/health/measles-death-texas.html" title=""&gt;where he attended the funeral&lt;/a&gt; of an 8-year-old girl who died after contracting measles. A raging outbreak there has sickened more than 500 people and killed two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In clips of the discussion released Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy offered one of his strongest endorsements yet of the measles vaccine. “People should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A few moments later, however, he raised safety concerns about the shot, as he has previously: “We don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For months, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;Mr. Kennedy has faced intense criticism&lt;/a&gt; for his handling of the West Texas outbreak from medical experts who believe that his failure to offer a full-throated endorsement of immunization has hampered efforts to contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Moreover, he has promoted unproven treatments for measles, like cod liver oil. Doctors in Texas believe its use is tied to signs &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title=""&gt;of liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; in some children arriving in local hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Throughout the outbreak, Mr. Kennedy has often paired support for vaccines with discussions of safety concerns about the shots, along with “miraculous” alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Over the weekend, he posted on social media that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was “the most effective way” to prevent the spread of measles — a statement met with relief from infectious disease experts and with fury from his vaccine-hesitant base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That night, he posted again, this time applauding “two extraordinary healers” who he claimed had effectively treated roughly 300 measles-stricken children with budesonide, a steroid, and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists say there are no cures for a measles infection, and that claiming otherwise undermines the importance of a vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Later in the CBS interview, Mr. Kennedy was pressed on the administration’s recent move &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" title=""&gt;to halt more than $12 billion&lt;/a&gt; in federal grants to state programs that address infectious disease, mental health and childhood vaccinations, among other efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;(&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/hhs-public-health-grants-judge.html" title=""&gt;A judge has temporarily blocked the cuts&lt;/a&gt; after a coalition of states sued the Trump administration.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy said he wasn’t familiar with the interruptions, then asserted that they were “mainly D.E.I. cuts,” referring &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion" title=""&gt;to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Jonathan LaPook, CBS’s medical correspondent, asked about specific research cuts at universities, including a $750,000 grant to researchers at the University of Michigan to study adolescent diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I didn’t know that, and that’s something that we’ll look at,” Mr. Kennedy said. “There’s a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNbmZSaC1LMTBKaWU5NThhZDk3MlBOcUtxRG1aeGpoMWdYNkRCUXJzcV9YVlVXMEMzSDNKa1lQaG5FZFZBaWU4ZFh0dE9SQ2gwT1I0RjlVTTVGclY1a0tyTjZQVkVLMFcxT0hiQUFRS2UxdUdFV1BmaURyX1ctMm5DY3J6YmJoa1dKZVJ6ZnNmcWstV19WNnRFNVhjS2hIUV9qLWcwUm13</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. praises measles response in Texas, US by making comparison to Europe - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQ3l4QnVOdGFUTjZBRlhHMlhGUTZDMmtGOFNXUUlKbjFpNmJvOEJKbDBaSW1ubXBqX3hRRkZBaGZsZFVRbVJDYTFUUEF6UVZSclVISDNwSzFhdE9yT29jSEZXSUp4MDZYYkFadXVwVnFkYUtwNVJmWE1lZUZRTjJjNm9icmZtNHBjZ1FYVHV5cDBLR0U2RmwwdkZrZWPSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmFtS0pROHRnVU9fZXk1V3N1RDJDY2IwcXVCelREQnY4YkRTTnhwZ1BNLTVEc3RXOVdNenR6cTIwVlpuTzloUnlsanpTUkRYT2hZV3l4aHNMZzJFcVR5TDNta2ZCYWFPc3AxZ3hRMjdvQzJHbGdWdkhyY2htcHlQMkZuckR1czNlenlGZ29sY2dIMTl3SDB6SlVGY1ZTNXJaQk5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;On Tuesday at a press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Most notably, they had a 133% higher chance to develop a brain lesion than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk wasn't isolated to the heavy drinkers alone, however, as former heavy drinkers still had an 89% higher risk, while moderate drinkers had a 60% higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think these are compelling results that link heavy alcohol consumption with lasting impacts on the brain," said Dr. Leana Wen, &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;'s wellness expert, previous Baltimore health commissioner, and emergency physician. "It’s especially telling that former heavy drinkers have evidence of sustained damage, although halting that heavy drinking does appear to lower risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming discovery, Wen said that the severity of the study should still be taken in proportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are caveats to this study," Wen said.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) has shown that Europe has adapted better to low temperatures than to high temperatures over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, carried out in collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/i&gt;, shows that there has been a significant decrease in cold-related mortality risk in recent years compared to the first decade of the 2000s. There has also been a reduction in the risk of heat-related deaths over this period, although to a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing temperature and mortality records from over 800 regions in 35 European countries for the period 2003-2020, the researchers found that the relative risk of death at the lowest temperatures fell by 2% per year. On the other hand, the relative risk of death at the highest temperatures also decreased, but at a lower average rate of 1% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New approach to account for regional differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, studies of this type have relied on fixed temperature thresholds to calculate risks, without taking into account that the vulnerability to identical temperatures is not the same in all parts of Europe. To overcome this limitation, the team developed a new concept: Extreme-Risk Temperature (ERT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By cross-referencing regional temperature and mortality data, this new approach made it possible to calculate the temperature at which the risk of death exceeds a certain threshold for each geographical area. The researchers also took into account variations in mortality to reflect adaptations to temperature over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this methodology, the team observed that in the period 2003–2020, Europe experienced 2.07 less dangerously cold days (cold-ERT days) each year. On the contrary, the dangerously hot days (heat-ERT days) increased by 0.28 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, not all parts of Europe were affected the same way. For example, Southeastern European regions, despite their warmer conditions, had more dangerous heat and cold days that caused a higher risk of associated mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have become better at coping with cold temperatures over time—a process known in science as 'adaptation.' For hot weather, people are also becoming resilient, though this improvement is less than the adaptation to cold," says Zhao-Yue Chen, ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The vulnerability to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/extreme+temperatures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;extreme temperatures&lt;/a&gt; varies widely across different locations, with regions in Southern Europe being more sensitive to temperature changes than those in Northern Europe. This disparity is partially due to socioeconomic factors, including inadequate housing insulation, lower public health expenditure and limited access to social support or assistance for vulnerable populations," Zhao-Yue Chen adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that, while Europe has made remarkable progress in adapting to cold, the strategies to cope with heat-related mortality have been less effective," says Joan Ballester Claramunt, ISGlobal researcher and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A 2024 survey revealed that only 20 out of 38 European countries have implemented temperature surveillance systems, and 17 countries still do not have heat-health action plans (HHAPs). Our study highlights the need for more progress in current heat adaptation measures and heat-health action plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, the observed spatial disparities underscore the need for region-specific strategies to protect vulnerable populations."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Combined effects of temperature and air pollution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at how often Extreme-Risk Temperatures happened on days with pollution levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits. The co-occurrence of these two events, known as "compound days", happened on 60% of heat-ERT days and 65% of cold-ERT days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, these combination days have been decreasing except for the combination of dangerously hot days and high levels of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution, which increased at a rate of 0.26 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozone is a secondary pollutant formed in the atmosphere as a result of the interaction between other gases and solar radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/global+warming/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; intensifies, combined heat and ozone episodes are becoming an inevitable and pressing concern for Europe. We need to consider compound days and develop specific strategies to tackle secondary pollutants such as ozone, because the health impacts of extreme temperatures and air pollution are not completely independent. There is an interaction between them that can amplify adverse health effects," says Zhao-Yue Chen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been carried out in the context of the &lt;a href="https://www.early-adapt.eu/" target="_blank"&gt;EARLY-ADAPT project&lt;/a&gt; and aimed at studying how populations are adapting to the public health challenges triggered by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

The study followed 243 individuals with a family history of Alzheimer’s over nearly seven years and found that those with affected fathers, especially women, showed greater tau buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this contradicts previous assumptions that maternal inheritance posed higher risk. These findings may help inform future strategies for personalized prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paternal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a father with Alzheimer’s is associated with greater tau protein spread in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; Female participants showed more extensive tau buildup than males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; 71 participants developed mild cognitive impairment during the study, a precursor to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While some studies have suggested that having a mother with Alzheimer’s disease may put you more at risk of developing the disease, a new study finds that having a father with the disease may be tied to a greater spread of the tau protein in the brain that is a sign of the disease, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not prove that having a father with Alzheimer’s results in these brain changes; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108553"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and his son." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that female participants may be more at risk of a heavier buildup of tau protein than male participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to see that people with a father with Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to the spread of tau in the brain, as we had hypothesized that we would see more brain changes in people with affected mothers,” said study author Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at 243 people who had a family history of Alzheimer’s disease but had no thinking or memory problems themselves at the average age of 68. Family history was defined as one or both parents with the disease or at least two siblings with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had brain scans and took tests of thinking and memory skills at the start of the study and then during the study as they were followed for an average of nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people with a father with Alzheimer’s disease as well as female participants had a greater spread of tau protein in the brain. Female participants also had a heavier buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Better understanding these vulnerabilities could help us design personalized interventions to help protect against Alzheimer’s disease,” Villeneuve said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study is that white people made up the majority of participants, so the results may not apply to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Quebec Research Fund – Health, J.-Louis Lévesque Foundation, Brain Canada Foundation, Alzheimer’s Society Canada and Brain Canada Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553b363a3b2734311534343b7b363a38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:57:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1kVjU4bGhKX0lhMVNGUkYtYTlVNUlvc2ZkNU8yZndob2VFWFpNam42QVBCVER4eTV0YUNCb19JaVRYcnlGai0xcTN4VVVWNjJ5Y0dsdHlheFRzSjZvc3l3b1BhaHU</guid></item><item><title>Illinois unveils online tool showing measles vaccination rates by school - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOVk1SaDFWVldHN3lJR0RsZmhXWHNxVnRMX1ZLbThWc1pyR0d0RkFCS2V3dHRFa3FzRFBjT2ZNa0UtWmlfbTZkOHVkdE5aZDlkVlU3QjdJZkpSRW4xWU9SSllaX3hvcExWcmJCa2JRR2Z1aWZYTXFwZm5vajVFT1lQTmhSdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles spreading across the country, the Illinois Department of Public Health unveiled a &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;new online tool&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that allows people to look up measles vaccination rates and data about the risk of outbreaks at individual schools across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had any reported cases of measles yet this year, but there were 607 reported cases across the country so far this year, as of April 3, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;Texas announced&lt;/a&gt; that a second child with measles had died. In all, three people with measles in the U.S. have died this year, and all three were unvaccinated. Before the recent outbreak, there had not been a measles death in the U.S. for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our new dashboard provides the public with the ability to review the measles vaccination rates in their child’s school and its risk for an outbreak,” said Dr. Sameer Vohra, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; uses school vaccination data from 2023-2024 to predict, project and estimate the size and spread of a measles outbreak in individual Illinois schools. People looking up schools in Cook County should look under “Suburban-Cook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is encouraging school administrators and staff to use the dashboard to help make decisions related to outbreak prevention and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra urged Illinois residents to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are recommended for lifetime protection and are 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. One dose is 93% effective against the illness. The first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine is typically is given at age 12 months to 15 months. Children typically receive the second dose between ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;more than 20 states&lt;/a&gt; have reported confirmed cases of measles, with the largest outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring Indiana said Wednesday it has &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/idoh-news-release-indiana-department-of-health-confirms-5-new-measles-cases?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;confirmed six cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, including four minors who were unvaccinated and two adults whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra said the state health department is working with local public health departments and health care organizations to “prepare for any potential measles cases in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had a case of measles since an &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/30/citys-public-health-department-declares-measle-outbreak-over-according-to-report/"&gt;outbreak in March 2024&lt;/a&gt; in which 67 cases were reported, with most linked to a Chicago shelter for migrants on the Lower West Side where nearly 2,500 people were living in close quarters. That outbreak was the largest in Illinois since 1990, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can check their vaccination status by contacting their health care providers or looking at their medical records. Or they can use the Illinois Department of Public Health’s online portal, &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Encourages+Measles+Vaccination&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fdph.illinois.gov%2fvaxverify.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1333387&amp;amp;sfmc_id=128588093"&gt;Vax Verify&lt;/a&gt;, to check their immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;

Men in the top 10% of scores were invited for further investigations.

Using functional MRI scans, scientists observed disruptions in the frontal-limbic system and cerebellar cortex, regions involved in executive function and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes intensified and expanded as treatment progressed, suggesting a cumulative impact on brain function. The findings may help explain the cognitive difficulties often experienced during and after chemotherapy, commonly known as “chemo brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Chemotherapy quickly alters brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions were found in areas linked to memory and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity changes worsened and spread over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/em&gt; has uncovered changes in brain connectivity during chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study of 55 patients with breast cancer and 38 controls without cancer, investigators conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of participants’ brains over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108549"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These changes got worse and spread more as chemotherapy continued.

Two matched female healthy control (HCs, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20 and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18) groups received the same assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0005-title"&gt;Field Strength/Sequence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rs-fMRI (gradient-echo EPI) and 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence at 3.0 T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0006-title"&gt;Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain functional networks were analyzed using graph theory approaches. We analyzed changes in brain connectome metrics and explored the relationship between these changes and clinical scales (including emotion and cognitive test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were divided into subgroups according to clinical classification, chemotherapy regimen, and menopausal status.

These abnormalities expanded with chemotherapy progression significantly (TP2 vs. TP3). T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;opological parameters changes were also correlated with clinical scales changes significantly. No differences were found within or between HC groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.490–0.989) or BC subgroups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.053–0.988) at TP1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0009-title"&gt;Data Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAC affects the brain functional connectome of BC patients at TP2, and these changes persist and further intensify at TP3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0110-title"&gt;Level of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0111-title"&gt;Technical Efficacy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:04:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1ndG1rbThUU0FEeHBGSnF1aTY2UkY4NXljcjFXRWZWa0hoa1hHT3NkallVLW8zT2RHejZ0NS1NTHN2M0ozR1RmblUtZ0ttbTdQb0syeFdaenIzcHBNREJZODYyYzZ2anFOWHRFNkMtT1VLb1ZYVHc</guid></item><item><title>Five new measles cases confirmed in Indiana - WSBT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPOXpLMjYzbUZoMl9JY3BMMUV4MkxkQzJ5eDRfZE9JdDA4TjJ4ZWNfelBycGVJR3hXRWVPOU80Rmt4SWw5MzZ6WmxPSG1NUEt2UTQxTlhib1JVX1lfWTZUZmZFMVhKSHJlUVVNUTNqNF9tMHMtOVVodHFrcS1VS3BLNmJ2MHZ6ZTFwaEhEVldCY3VEUndLVmdKRW1HR3JXa1loazZrV0VfT0hKQlRCVXZmdmRxdFpfUU1oVGpKc1lrblpQcGRt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind.

Scientists found that serotonin neurons encode a “prospective code for value,” signaling expectations about upcoming outcomes and how rapidly those expectations are changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps the brain assess the value of possible actions in shifting environments, guiding everyday decision-making. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about serotonin and offer a unifying theory relevant to neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons encode expectations about upcoming rewards and punishments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons respond to surprise, pain, and pleasure—depending on expected value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain vs. Machine:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s value-signaling system via serotonin differs significantly from artificial systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our day-to-day lives, we’re constantly making a slew of decisions from immediate matters to prospects on the far horizon. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evolutionary nuts-and-bolts of how our brains weigh these numerous daily decisions and what role is played by the neurotransmitter serotonin has been shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108545"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study led by an interdisciplinary University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine team delivers fascinating findings on this big topic and potentially unravels a hidden aspect of what our nervous system’s extraordinarily complex serotonin system is really doing inside the enigmatic organ in our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, this study from a highly impactful international collaboration was considered by one of the expert reviewers who evaluated the work to offer “broad implications across neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, enhancing our understanding of serotonin’s role in mood regulation, learning, and motivated behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s innovative work merges ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) theory – used in neuroscience to better understand learning, behavior, and decision-making – with recent hard-won insights into the filtering properties of the brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus. That’s a region of the mammalian brainstem rich in serotonin-producing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is often painted as the brain’s “pleasure chemical.” Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) famously target the serotonin system as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, serotonin’s precise role in the nervous system is ambiguous and perplexing: It’s implicated in everything from mood and movement regulation to appetite and sleep-wake cycles. The fact that it’s activated by pain, pleasure and surprise has long been a brain research puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, the uOttawa-led researchers put forth a unifying perspective on serotonin they dub a “prospective code for value” – a biological code for how the brain places a value for future rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code essentially explains why serotonin neurons are activated in the brain in response to both rewards and punishments, with a preference for surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work asks the question: What does serotonin tell the brain? In a nutshell, we find that its message closely matches the expectation of future rewards,” says senior author Dr. Richard Naud, associate professor at the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicineand the uOttawa Department of Physics&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, puts the main findings like this: “Your brain needs to compute the expected value of the actions you contemplate and undertake as you interact with a changing world, asking ‘What’s the value of this decision versus that decision in that particular environment?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a hard problem. So what we think serotonin actually does in the brain is encode the expected value of a particular environment or course of actions in order to ultimately guide everyday decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs. Béïque and Naud are both members of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The germ of the idea began years ago at the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine when first author Emerson Harkin&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; then a PhD student in Dr. Naud’s lab, started to simulate reinforcement-learning models while working on the biophysical properties of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harkin, who finished his PhD work at uOttawa in late 2023 and was awarded his degree in March 2024, says the core idea came “half-serendipitously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investing a lot of time and effort studying the electrical properties of the brain cells that produce serotonin, he and his uOttawa Faculty of Medicine supervisors started looking closely at findings from other labs that focused on measuring the activity of serotonin neurons in animals experiencing rewards and punishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody seemed to have considered the possibility that serotonin neurons might be activated by &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; in the animal’s surroundings, like the start of a signal that reward will arrive soon or the end of a punishment,” says Dr. Harkin, referring to lab experiments with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at these previous results through the lens of what we had seen under our microscopes and with our electrodes, a lot of results that had previously seemed puzzling or contradictory suddenly started to fit together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in Germany doing a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Dr. Harkin asserts that the findings show a big part of what the serotonin system does is send a “message to the rest of the brain saying: “Here’s our best guess about how good your near future will be, and here’s how quickly that guess is improving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Naud, a computational neuroscience expert who drilled down on the theory’s deeply complex math, explains the initial idea evolved quite a bit over the last couple of years as the collaborative team finetuned the work with “lots of reading, lots of discussion, lots of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the research team aims to study the role of serotonin on behavior to try and figure out what the rest of the brain does with the neurotransmitter’s messages. Dr. Naud says perhaps finding ways of employing reinforcement-learning theory on frameworks can help them do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dr. Naud, whose neuroscience work often has implications for theories of learning and memory that can inform future developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), believes the team’s study just published in &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;appears to show how special the nervous system really is&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a way I feel that the team’s findings show that the brain doesn’t work the way machines do. If we perturb the signaling of rewards in the machine it would do many things that the perturbation in brains don’t do,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6515090a020a110d0025100a11110412044b0604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08731-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;” by Richard Naud et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons to emotionally salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centring on reward, surprise, salience and uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:48:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9uQ3hySFpFYWxWUlpOSmlwOGpuaDc2TXRWeEQxNmhiM21RcG85cHRON0JLd2VvOGdlUTVTckVveHQ0SGczNkxFM0Q3dmlNLU1wMXBuenpVMDZ2OGxlaC1LTjNaYlN3NDZlRFVhVGZqT3c0cjQ</guid></item><item><title>Another state reports measles outbreak - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQMlZ2V1BreVNTRzl0OHE4RGduMjU3SDZhcFJKaXVQOGhMQ2pfeFFIT2xqMndsdnBveXhaZWxfSGY1aEJkVmVVVHVFeG5mVGxBYm5vNFg1bjhOdzRxSEI3djVvZzJlR3k3bWV0RkVmNE5xZzJzWWk5R04tSkFhekt1VWNMRFJYWXRTTEN4b0pn0gGiAUFVX3lxTFBnekNuR3IxUWNqTVJTdUFpT1ZhUGZHY1JtZ2I1NVZXYXFWTHN6dThaaWk2cHkzY1N1R2JDWkxhYVBpVVl3RUJ6Wm9Ea0dwQ2Z3aUlmS0VaQ0V2TFRrVEhUbXp1Y081c1Ryc0l0eWFIMjJFVGZmQ0Fyb2d5c0g2Ty1wLWZLbnh6eXRxa0FJTHplYmRkNGVLV3Fsejc5bWRsUTJfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4XSVRIHPGRGTNODN37PX5CYHRI"&gt;Indiana health officials announced a measles outbreak Wednesday, with six cases that have no known links to the outbreaks in several other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QRZCHGXUTJDNJASDE6X3KA5ELI"&gt;The U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZET2XPAZTNEWRCVQBNAQQUSWGY"&gt;Texas is reporting the majority of them with 505.

His private comments, however, betray his &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-poppers-hiv-prevention" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;conspiratorial leanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the funeral for eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand — the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/06/measles-texas-outbreak-death-unvaccinated/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;second known child&lt;/a&gt; to die from measles complications in Texas, the heart of the outbreak — the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/texas-funeral-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;girl's father told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-vaxxer now running America's healthcare seemed to fall down on the job when he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;came to pay his respects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did not say that the vaccine was effective," Pete Hildebrand, the father of the unvaccinated girl, told the newspaper of the Health and Human Services secretary. "I had supper with the guy... and he never said anything about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his public change of heart regarding the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, it's not exactly shocking that Kennedy is privately talking out of both sides of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the outbreak of the previously-contained respiratory virus claimed its first life — an unvaccinated six-year-old Mennonite girl who, like Hildebrand, died in West Texas' Gaines County — the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-five-more-worms" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brain-wormed political scion&lt;/a&gt; not only &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-cod-liver-oil-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;touted natural treatments&lt;/a&gt; over vaccination, but also suggested that immunity was better gained by simply &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-suggests-getting-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;allowing children to get the measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be, when you and I were kids, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection," &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Kennedy told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; host Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; during a March interview. "The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That claim, it's worth noting, is undercut by strong evidence that catching measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(19)31728-7/fulltext" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;weakens a child's immune system&lt;/a&gt; so significantly that they may become more susceptible to getting sicker from &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; illnesses down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with that first measles death, Kennedy once again sent mixed messages about measles prevention and treatment.

All underwent autopsies of their brains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though binge drinking had the most detrimental effects, even drinking less alcohol was shown to have lasting consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Former heavy drinkers were found to have 89 percent higher odds of developing brain legions compared to teetotalers and moderate drinkers were at a 60 percent higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, study author Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo said: 'Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at how alcohol affects the brain as people get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that heavy alcohol consumption is damaging to the brain, which can lead to memory and thinking problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo said understanding these effects of alcohol is crucial for public health awareness and 'continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-3b4db4e0-c936-11ef-83cb-3564571cc7ae" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; warns that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health and it is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the US, behind tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol use contributes to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research over the past four decades has revealed a 'causal relationship' between alcohol use and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, including of the breast, colon, liver and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of how alcohol causes cancer, an advisory from the US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy says there are 'four distinct ways' that it works inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, alcohol breaks down into acetaldehyde once it is consumed. Acetaldehyde is a substance that causes cancer by binding to DNA and damaging it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin to grow uncontrollably and create a cancerous tumor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second, alcohol generates 'reactive oxygen species, which increase inflammation and can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids in the body through a process called oxidation'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirdly, alcohol alters hormone levels (including estrogen), which the experts say can play a role in the development of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lastly, carcinogens from other sources, especially particles of tobacco smoke, can dissolve in alcohol, making it easier for them to be absorbed into the body, increasing the risk for mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The current US Dietary Guidelines recommend that American men should consume no more than two alcoholic drinks a day and women should consume no more than one alcoholic beverage per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, studies suggested that there was some benefit to drinking moderate amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in recent years, research has swung the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new Dietary Guidelines will be published in 2026 and it is believed that Americans could soon be urged &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12438233/Americans-limited-two-beers-strict-new-alcohol-guidelines-Bidens-booze-czar.html"&gt;to drink no more than two bottles of beer&lt;/a&gt; or glasses of wine per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The guidelines will eventually be signed off on by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 60million Americans report binge drinking at least once a year, and on average Americans who drink alcohol say they consume about drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that rates of binge drinking among people ages 18 to 25 are decreasing but remain high (28.7 percent in 2023). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health of full-time college students ages 18 to 22, 46.3 percent drank alcohol and 27.9 percent engaged in binge drinking in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo's team noted that a limitation of their study was that it did not look at participants before death and they did not have information on the duration of alcohol consumption and a ranking of their cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:10:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPR2luWlNqVlZXTTFBZmJOY0t5NHR6MWp6amJ0cFZhdExkVm16R3lsQVFWQlpLZkxrYUNNeUMyLUFyaUdtXzdTNGNoTVV3VWNMNTF4Q3RrNWgwRjFuMjVEQnBaUlZKSzFqVmdWMThPajhsWjE2OTNtLV9ucnpOdFh4d0Q3TXh1OV8yWmdVRGxvaWNyU3NEYmEtd0VB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5DYVh2bGpVbXlxZFlLQ1NHU2tUUjZ4dERwcjVOMk5SUWtqd1VlSGRwSmJGemg2OUR5bllMSmdheC15RXFJYkl1eVB1cUF3czkzSVJwREl0RE9tZkVyUWxybzJiZ3FwbUpvbmFQWW40Q05oeno5ZERDaGo0ckRmcXBpVXhibTNoX1BlOWNYNUhiUEFyZkZoQVh2TXA1WXI3SQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles case confirmed in Montcalm County, 4th in Michigan - FOX 17 West Michigan News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNU3VmQ1hRNGh2MVY5T1BCQkVqcjFKV3I2WlYwckh6T2ItNXRtd3ZwaFVESVlmWGo2TUNlMmxUZkJIWWR5UUFWbnRNMkU1Y2Y2Ykd3cmdBTkRIQkl5dE9VdlQyQl9QNU9zNmFnU1J2Tmo2S3lsLTE3TGl6OC1UeXgySVlEc05HQW9lYUNCRF9SaFZGUFdfREJ5RHAtejFZdEVUdTBBS243VFFiUGNpYmtYY2JqSTZpcjhocG8w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A fourth person in Michigan has a confirmed case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was announced Wednesday, April 9, for a person living in Montcalm County.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of contracting the disease through exposure to an infected individual. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine provides protection for decades, according to the health department. The vaccine could also help fight an infection if the shot is received within 3 days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people can spread the virus several days before symptoms appear, with the disease taking 1 to 3 weeks to affect a new person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots on cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth, plus a rash that starts near the hairline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you were exposed to or have measles, you are encouraged to contact your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/measles-outbreaks-bring-concerns-as-spring-breakers-come-home" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

The statement came after Kennedy attended the funeral of a third measles victim over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;epidemiologists&lt;/a&gt; and public health experts, who argue he failed to give a full-throated endorsement of an extremely effective vaccine, that cases appear to be severely undercounted and that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The numbers continue to grow by the day, but … the growth rate has diminished substantially,” Kennedy told reporters during a press conference, while promoting his health agenda through the American south-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health experts have said that, in fact, there is little evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I would compare it to what’s happening in Europe now,” Kennedy continued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/04/09/states-race-to-offset-the-loss-of-obamacare-subsidies-00279443" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;. “They’ve had 127,000 cases and 37 deaths. And so, what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy appeared to reference figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) released in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;. In that instance, global health officials were referring to cases across 53 countries in Europe and central Asia, which make up the WHO’s “European region”. Included in that tally are nations such as Romania and Kazakhstan, which together account for nearly 60,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is the most contagious illness that we know of and it is preventable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director of the American Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Association. “What we’re seeing now… is a far, far undercount in terms of the actual number of cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before the current outbreak, the US had not had a measles death &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vaccines-measles-outbreak-immune-system" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have now died as a result of the Texas outbreak, and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 500&lt;/a&gt; people have gotten sick, according to Texas authorities. Because measles has an average death rate of one to three per 1,000, public health officials believe cases are undercounted. The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy said CDC staff would be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;redeployed&lt;/a&gt; to the outbreak in Texas. This week, Kennedy also said the best way to prevent measles is to get the vaccine. However, he also used his attendance at a measles victim’s funeral to promote &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unproven therapies for measles&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We should have had more people on the ground – this should have been a priority for weeks and weeks,” said Polan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000. However, anti-vaccine sentiment first stoked by a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraudulent scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Lancet and then by non-profits, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;such as the one&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy led for nearly a decade, has stoked a dramatic increase in vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The decline in trust in vaccines has been especially precipitous among Republicans and Republican-leaning adults. A &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; from August 2024 found the percentage of Republicans who believe it is extremely important to vaccinate children fell from more than 60% in the early 2000s to 26% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As trust in vaccines wanes among Republicans, and Kennedy himself voices lackluster support, Kennedy has enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high trust ratings&lt;/a&gt; among Republicans – nearly as high as Donald Trump himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made the comments as the department he oversees, Health and Human Services, undergoes a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/hhs-cdc-fda-layoffs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/health-layoff-future-science-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;largely opaque&lt;/a&gt; restructuring. A total of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/rfk-jr-health-department-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;20,000 positions&lt;/a&gt; have been eliminated between a cut of 10,000 made by Kennedy and an additional 10,000 employees cut by billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC lost &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2,400 employees&lt;/a&gt; in the restructuring. Overall, HHS will lose nearly a quarter of its workforce. Kennedy has also installed vaccine skeptics in important roles within the agency, including at least one who has &lt;a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/agency-leadership/us-fda/highly-problematic-acting-fda-commissioner-paused-planned-ok-of-novavax-shot-GUT6LR4X6ZALRMMZAEXYZHY36Y/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paused approval&lt;/a&gt; of a Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further, basic research into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; has been under threat during Kennedy’s tenure. Before he took office, he tried to force the federal government to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rescind authorization&lt;/a&gt; for Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s statements also come as HHS has clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn&lt;/a&gt; in funding to local and state health departments – including grants that had funded &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immunization clinics&lt;/a&gt; near the measles outbreak in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj01FQfJ1-Q" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy denied knowledge of the clawbacks, and said: “I’m not familiar with those cuts … The cuts were mainly [diversity, equity and inclusion] cuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 19:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQSmZPNzl4NW1MYzVRQnhHeHg0SUg1Wm9wbXR5Y1ZuXy0yU2dkeVhDRDNlRWM1MWVnaUVWSWJNVXFLSGtqZkJjSFNZMVNlMnMzVGNsS0NXTUQzV2NMdDRuX3oySjZJZ1NwbFFWRy1CV2pta3pmVWZpRjBLOUdEVko0OGpzbw</guid></item><item><title>U.S. maternal mortality rate increased 27% over five years, NIH study finds - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPZ1VLb1RwRnljYl9VeXVyTC1FNzYzZjFIMnJMMDB5aVFWemdHYkFEc2RMZDR2b1VSZ0pKWFNsUXhfRGVRQ0JCcEtfcXBWNW04R0toRlFoeUE5S3doUXBwNU9ORW5JcnE3UWxMRFZob3RsWWNSLVhtS1dLQ1JfVGM2U0VXeTFKMXpBUW9NRGVBYnFsakRGLWVpN3VNazNSaFFYSFhDclBnUEpqc2RLMmpMSnBxTzdyRmFpd1pF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new U.S. government paper documenting an increase in maternal mortality from 2018 to 2022 does not hedge in its conclusion, calling the issue “an urgent public health priority.” That it was published amid &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-start-under-rfk-jr-trump-administration/"&gt;massive job and funding cuts at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt; charged with reducing these deaths has not escaped notice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A week ago, much of the department tasked with monitoring and improving maternal and child health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was placed on leave, while some researchers who study maternal mortality have had their funding rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hard time for this to come out,” said Rose Molina, an OB-GYN at Harvard Medical School, who co-authored the study. “We cannot take our eyes off of maternal health right now, and if anything, we need to not just maintain focus, but actually increase investment in maternal health to bring down some of what we’re seeing — increases in pregnancy-related death rates, but also persistent inequities by racial and ethnic groups.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead authors, who work at the National Institutes of Health, were not available to comment on the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have also shown an increase in maternal mortality in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832320" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, shed light on long-term maternal health because it analyzed deaths up to a year postpartum. By expanding the window studied, the researchers found that cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental disorders were leading causes of late maternal deaths. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The paper analyzed data from a CDC database that is different from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/prams-maternal-mortality-cdc-layoffs/"&gt;hit hard by cuts last week&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, maternal mortality increased from 25.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018 to 32.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 — an age-adjusted increase of about 27%. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line finding lines up with previous research, said Marie Thoma, a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, who has studied maternal mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the new study provides more detail regarding state-level mortality and reaffirmed the prevalence of inequities by race. Rates of maternal mortality were 3.8 times higher in American Indian and Alaska Native women when compared to white women, and rates in Black women were 2.8 times higher. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She pointed to California as a reason to be optimistic. The state had the lowest rate of maternal mortality, and the authors of the study note that if the nationwide rates of maternal mortality were brought down to California’s level it would have saved 2,679 pregnancy-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of momentum,” said Thoma. She pointed to a &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/10/the-white-house-blueprint-for-addressing-the-maternal-health-crisis-two-years-of-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Biden administration blueprint&lt;/a&gt; for maternal health as an example of progress. But now, “there’s just so much uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kisha Davis, a member of the board of directors at the American Academy of Family Physicians and chief health officer for Montgomery County, Md., said she has seen progress in mitigating racial disparities in the hospitals within her county. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I saw some really great data from our hospitals, and was really encouraged from some of the interventions that they’re doing, and some of them are even starting to see a reversal in that disparity,” she said, naming initiatives to train clinicians about implicit racial bias, as well as training physicians outside the OB-GYN specialty to better support mothers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, some support for programs mitigating racial disparities has been cut, said Marian Jarlenski, a professor of health policy at the University of Pittsburgh. For example, funding for the Center to Advance Reproductive Justice and Behavioral Health among Black Pregnant/Postpartum Women and Birthing People at the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school, was &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cut in the past several weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some of these NIH initiatives to improve maternal mortality were started and funded in the first Trump administration, and they’re still going on. However, NIH has cut off funding for some of these maternal health research centers around the country, so it’s very confusing,” Jarlenski said. “This study that we’re talking about today shows why this is not a political issue, and it’s really important that we all be focusing on how we can reduce maternal mortality and working together on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A Montcalm County resident recently traveled out of state and brought back with them a case of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the Montcalm County case the fourth confirmed measles case this year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD) said they're working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to determine points of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMDHD advised that anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of catching it. They said the best protection against measles is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as the vaccine provides long-lasting protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At MMDHD, we take action to protect, maintain, and improve the health of our community," said Liz Braddock, MMDHD Health Officer. "Measles is a serious disease, and we want to make sure that our residents are safe. If you have recently traveled to regions with known measles outbreaks, and you are not vaccinated against measles, you should consider getting vaccinated as quickly as you can. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and families from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 9/10 people nearby a person infected with measles will also become infected if they are not protected according to MMDHD.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infected individuals can spread measles before noticing symptoms, including four days before the rash appears. Measles symptoms usually appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus but can take up to 21 days," advised MMDHD in a release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMDHD listed the following common measles symptoms to keep an eye out for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104˚F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts as flat red spots on the face at the hairline, then spreads to the trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin. Small, raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you may have been exposed to the measles or develop any of the symptoms listed above, you're asked to call your healthcare provider before seeking treatment so that steps can be taken to prevent exposure to other people before you go in for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles vaccine is highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection," said the MMDHD. "A single dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97% effective. It is also effective if it is given within 72 hours of measles exposure to prevent illness. Anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

"However, only a handful of U.S. studies have explored sociodemographic or socioeconomic characteristics that put people at risk of long COVID or have investigated its economic and mental health sequelae."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-scale government funding needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 35 million adults and 30 million working-age adults, or roughly 1 in 7, said they had experienced long COVID by late 2022 and 2023. Lost wages due to long COVID among working-age survey respondents were estimated at $211 billion in 2022 and $218 billion in 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An age- and sex-adjusted model of 2022 data from 154,430 participants estimated that those vaccinated against COVID-19 had a 14% lower risk of protracted symptoms than their unvaccinated peers, but a fully adjusted model found no difference in risk. In comparison, a fully adjusted model of 2023 data from 220,664 respondents found a higher risk of long COVID among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk factors for the condition were lower household income, Hispanic ethnicity, female sex, and gay, lesbian, or bisexual status. Long COVID was tied to elevated risks of recent unemployment, financial problems, and anxiety and depression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roughly 14.5 million adults overall and 10.9 million adults with long COVID still had symptoms in fall 2022 and fall 2023, respectively. Among adults with current long-COVID symptoms, there was evidence of a dose-response relationship, with those reporting the most impact on daily functioning having a more than two-fold higher risk of recent depression than those reporting no impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Overall, an estimated 24 million working-aged adults with long COVID had been or may still be at risk of adverse socioeconomic and mental health outcomes," Kim concluded. "The scale of long COVID and its sequelae necessitates large-scale governmental funding to address long COVID research priorities and a robust and coordinated policy response strategy, as well as ongoing national surveillance of the prevalence and health and economic burden of long COVID."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women, Black participants most affected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A survey-based &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-04039-5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Anhui Medical University researchers in China highlights the relationship between adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) and long COVID in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Black communities are often concentrated in areas with limited healthcare access, environmental pollution, and food insecurity, factors all linked to chronic inflammation and impaired recovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investigators parsed data on 16,446 US adults with a history of COVID-19 infection, 3,111 (18.6%) of them with long COVID, from the 2022 and 2023 National Health Interview Surveys from the National Center for Health Statistics. They measured cumulative social disadvantage using 18 SDoH indicators categorized into quartiles. The average participant age was 48.1 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Although the influence of SDoH on health conditions is well established, its relationship with long COVID has yet to be sufficiently explored," they wrote. "Understanding the relationship between cumulative social disadvantage and long COVID is crucial for identifying vulnerable populations and offering more tailored management and support." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Respondents in the highest quartile of social disadvantage were 152% more likely to report long COVID than those in the lowest quartile (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.52). This link persisted across demographic subgroups, with greater effects on women and Black participants and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic and White adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The stronger association among non-Hispanic Black groups reflects systemic inequalities beyond socioeconomic status," the researchers wrote. "Black communities are often concentrated in areas with limited healthcare access, environmental pollution, and food insecurity, factors all linked to chronic inflammation and impaired recovery."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of occupational exposure, discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The greatest social disadvantage burden was seen more often among long-COVID patients than among those without the condition (29.2% vs 15.2%). Adults with protracted symptoms in the most disadvantaged group were more than six times more likely to report poor general health than those in the least disadvantaged group (aOR, 6.34). Risk factors for long COVID included mental illness, financial instability, and poor healthcare access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Addressing systemic inequities through integrated public health strategies is essential to mitigate the burden of long COVID and reduce social disparities in health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors noted that social disadvantage prolongs COVID-19 symptoms by amplifying oxidative stress and immune dysregulation and that disadvantaged groups are more likely to engage in harmful behaviors, which increases their susceptibility to chronic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Beyond poverty, social inequalities such as occupational exposure and racial discrimination also make certain populations more vulnerable to virus exposure," they wrote. "Workers in long-term care facilities and public service sectors, including education, social care, and transportation, are at higher risk for long COVID." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers said that healthcare providers need to take a holistic approach, particularly with socially disadvantaged groups during post-COVID recovery, by incorporating systematic screening for SDoH to identify high-risk populations and offer timely interventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Addressing systemic inequities through integrated public health strategies is essential to mitigate the burden of long COVID and reduce social disparities in health," they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This may help explain why frequent cannabis use can increase the risk of hallucinations and delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using neuromelanin-MRI scans, researchers showed that dopamine-related brain signals were significantly higher in individuals with CUD, and the increase correlated with the severity of use. These findings may help healthcare providers educate youth and high-risk groups about the mental health impacts of chronic cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; People with cannabis use disorder showed elevated dopamine signals in brain regions tied to psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Amplified:&lt;/strong&gt; The more severe the cannabis use, the higher the dopamine signal—regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; One in five Canadian youth use cannabis frequently, underscoring the need for better public education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A McGill University-led study found that people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) had elevated dopamine levels in a brain region associated with psychosis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,” said first author Jessica Ahrens, a PhD student in McGill’s Integrated Program in Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108537"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. While it was known that cannabis influences dopamine, this study clarifies where in the brain these changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their cannabis use, continues despite negative effects, and may experience cravings or withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, clinical researchers across the world have been searching for a link showing that cannabis affects the brain mechanism behind psychosis. We now show that a shared dopamine pathway could be the answer,” Ahrens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 61 people, including those with and without cannabis use disorder, as well as individuals with early-stage schizophrenia, some of whom also had CUD. Using a specialized brain scan called neuromelanin-MRI, researchers at Western University measured their neuromelanin signal, which reflects dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD had an abnormally high neuromelanin signal, and the elevation was tied to the severity of their cannabis use. In contrast, those without schizophrenia or CUD did not show this increase. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educating youth about cannabis risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one-in-five youth in Canada are cannabis users, consuming it daily or almost daily. Understanding the drug’s impact on mental health remains a pressing question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,” said Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, Professor of Psychiatry at McGill and Psychiatrist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use, especially for those with a family history of psychosis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will explore whether long-term cannabis use leads to lasting dopamine changes and whether these effects reverse after quitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Schizophrenia Society of Canada Foundation, the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis, the Fonds de Recherche du Québec—Santé, the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, the Canada Research Chairs program and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis and CUD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3358565a5f521d575643524356735e50545a5f5f1d5052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/a&gt;” by Jessica Ahrens et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as the &lt;em&gt;neuromelanin-MRI signal&lt;/em&gt;, a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in CUD and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in those with a CUD whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia (FES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal observational cohort study recruited individuals from 2019 to 2023 from an early psychosis service and the surrounding communities in London, Ontario. The sample included individuals with and without CUD, with some in each group also diagnosed with FES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FES and CUD diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI signals within the midbrain (substantia nigra [SN]/ventral tegmental area [VTA]) including a subregion previously linked to the severity of untreated psychosis (a priori region of interest). Linear mixed-effects analyses were performed relating neuromelanin-MRI signals to clinical measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 36 individuals without CUD (mean [SD] age, 22.3 [3.2] years; 29 male [81%]; 12 with FES) and 25 individuals with CUD (mean [SD] age, 24.3 [4.7] years; 22 male [88%]; 16 with FES) participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-year follow-up was completed for 12 individuals with CUD and 25 without CUD. CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in a set of ventral SN/VTA voxels (387 of 2060 SN/VTA voxels, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03, permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUD was also associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in the psychosis-related region of interest (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .04) with a significant dose-dependent association (higher burden of CUD symptoms associated with higher neuromelanin-MRI signal, &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1, 96&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.89; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants with FES did not exhibit a significant elevation in neuromelanin-MRI signal (241 SN/VTA voxels had elevated signal, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .09). There was no association between time and neuromelanin-MRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated dopamine function in a critical SN/VTA subregion may be associated with psychosis risk in people with CUD.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A special type of chewing gum can 'trap' and neutralize some influenza and herpes viruses, according to new experiments from scientists in the US and Finland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1/-2) can both cause oral herpes, and despite being one of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-more-than-one-in-five-are-infected-with-an-incurable-sti"&gt;most common infections&lt;/a&gt; in the world, there are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hardly any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; preventative measures available today to stop the spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some scientists are hopeful that this new anti-viral gum could help fill that gap, especially as research on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;&lt;span&gt;herpes vaccine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; stalls due to a lack of funding. Plus, even if a vaccine is found, there are likely to be breakthrough infections, and chewing gum could help stop those from spreading further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current vaccines for influenza, for instance, do not prevent transmission from breakthrough infections, so this gum could be a useful addition for treating orally spread viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical-grade chewy is made from lablab bean powder, ground from the seeds of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lablab"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; species, which contain a natural viral trap protein called FRIL. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In experiments using a mechanical mouth, chewing the liquid-soaked gum for 15 minutes released more than 50 percent of the FRIL proteins it contained. Collecting the simulated saliva from this chewing, researchers then tested how well the liquid neutralizes viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Depending on the dose of FRIL to start with, the 'saliva' produced from chewing showed greater than 95 percent neutralization of the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in the lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also showed up to 75 percent neutralization of the HSV-1 virus and up to 94 percent of the HSV-2 virus – the two most common herpes viruses out there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutralization means that the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="157514" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; is less likely to infect cells and replicate itself, which would theoretically lead to a reduce viral load and lower chances of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.12.008"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biochemist Henry Daniell from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157526" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-642x998.jpg" alt="Chewing Gum Mechanics" class="size-medium wp-image-157526" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-642x998.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-267x415.jpg 267w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-768x1194.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-988x1536.jpg 988w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-1317x2048.jpg 1317w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-600x933.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157526" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The mastication simulator and amount of total protein and FRIL released. (Daniell et al., &lt;em&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new study builds on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/news-events/2022/09/08/chewing-gum-designed-to-trap-sars-cov-2-in-the-saliva-moves-to-clinical-trial-from-dr-henry-daniells-lab/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;previous experiments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that chewing gum containing certain anti-virals can get rid of more than 95 percent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in mouth swabs or saliva samples, thereby &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/chewing-gum-could-reduce-sars-cov-2-transmission"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reducing oral transmission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are now testing that 'anti-COVID' chewing gum in clinical trials, but in the meantime, researchers are turning to other viruses to see if the solution works there as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, another &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108016"&gt;&lt;span&gt;previous study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in 2020 on lablab beans found that FRIL proteins effectively reduced levels of H5N1 and H7N9 – both of which are influenza viruses that can cause flu in humans and birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be a major global challenge," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-dental-antiviral-chewing-gum-reduce-influenza-and-herpes-simplex-virus-transmission"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Daniell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach seems to be most suitable for reducing viral loads in saliva and the throat area, which are two main sites of oral viral transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US FDA generally considers lablab bean powder to be safe and non-toxic for human use at low enough levels. Whether it proves to be an effective anti-viral in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="157514" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.12.008"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. — Five new measles cases have been confirmed in Indiana. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indiana Department of Health (IDOH)&lt;/a&gt; said the newly reported cases are three minors and two adults in Allen County. This now brings the state total to six people in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial case was &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/indiana-first-confirmed-measles-case-of-2025-concerns-pediatricians-vaccine-vaccinations-mmr/531-ff3d974c-9793-40c1-930c-87096cbf4274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, officials said, and all six cases are connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no known links to outbreaks in any other states.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department says the four minors were unvaccinated and the adults’ vaccination status is "unclear." However, all them are recovering.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads easily from person to person," the IDOH said in a news release. "It is an airborne disease, meaning it spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can stay alive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, officials said. People born before 1957 are "presumed to be immune." &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"Measles begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes usually about 7 to 14 days after exposure to measles but can occur up to 21 days. The fever increases and can get as high as 105 degrees," the IDOH said. "Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Then two to four days after symptoms begin, a rash starts on the hairline and face. It spreads down the back and torso, and then extends to the arms and hands, as well as the legs and feet. After about five days, the rash fades the same order in which it appeared."&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What concerns me as a pediatrician is, this didn't have to happen," Indianapolis pediatrician Dr. Eric Yancy said. "Untrue stories came out related to the measles vaccine, which had been completely debunked, completely tossed aside, but yet still they tend to persist. Then immunization rates tend to drop, individuals are susceptible and then you run into problems with recurring cases. And people think, 'Oh, it's just a few spots and a little rash, it goes away.' No. It's a very bad disease. It can cause many types of complications, some serious, some deadly."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Of course, the study has raised a lot of questions about how and why this can happen, so &lt;em&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; tapped some experts to have them weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about this fascinating case study, and what it might tell us about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63773457/alzheimers-disease-single-cause-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://rf-research-facility.engineering.pitt.edu/people/jr-jiun-jean-liou-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; lead study author and a post-doctoral associate at University of Pittsburgh, &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report describes a woman in her 60s with Down syndrome who participated in Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium – Down Syndrome Research Study for 10 years. (People with Down syndrome have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9387748/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:90 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; chance of developing dementia in their lifetime, which is why some Alzheimer's researchers study these patients.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman’s brain was donated to research after her death, and it was analyzed by researchers for signs of Alzheimer’s disease. But while &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63183223/early-signs-and-symptoms-of-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MRI images showed elements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MRI images showed elements&lt;/a&gt; in the woman’s brain that suggested she had Alzheimer’s disease, she had no outward signs of the disease before she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The woman had reached an age when most individuals with Down syndrome develop dementia symptoms, yet she remained cognitively stable,” says &lt;a href="https://rf-research-facility.engineering.pitt.edu/people/jr-jiun-jean-liou-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; lead study author and a post-doctoral associate at University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the woman not experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isn’t entirely clear. “Although we conducted comprehensive assessments in cognition, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarkers before her passing, we still don’t fully understand why she showed cognitive resilience,” Liou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few theories. It’s possible that the woman carried the protective e2 allele of the APOE gene (a genetic variant linked to decreased risk of dementia), which could have protected her from actually developing dementia, according to Liou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman also had a larger-than-average brain, which could have given her more brain reserve, allowing her to build up more brain changes linked with Alzheimer’s disease before having symptoms, Liou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also possible that her above-average education, associated with healthier lifestyles and life choices, contributed to her cognitive resilience,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this tell us about disease progression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say. In Alzheimer’s disease, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8876037/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid proteins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; create plaques between brain cells, which can disrupt communication and function. But “disease progression in the real world is very different than in a laboratory,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen patients with high amyloid burdens sharp as a tack and patients without any amyloid burden unable to tie their own shoes,” he continues. “Studies like this indicate how shaky the amyloid hypothesis of memory loss and dementia is in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Liou says that cases like this one provide “valuable insights” into why some people develop dementia at certain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know about how women’s brains might differ in the way Alzheimer’s shows up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, &lt;a href="https://apple.news/Ap299Bio0QnOyXH1cfWegwg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women are almost twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;women are almost twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and dementia, but they're also more resilient to disease progression (meaning, they have more pathology of the disease before they start showing symptoms). “Alzheimer’s dementia often afflicts ladies [at an older age] than it does men and the reasons for this gender difference remains unclear,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also tend to have denser brains, although it’s not clear why, Dr. Segil says. They also often have a larger store of verbal material, which may mean it takes longer for them to "lose" these words, stories and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Liou calls this a "fascinating case"—and it's easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 18:20:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1ZUlFrOTRCcm43SXExTWVSZXV5RGJCOVRiTTM2UnY0bXh6bnFJR24xa3ViRUpsMmJ3NmpuTHU3ZXQtNllFcGdLdU5xTE9mQjhIdGJvNklWMEw3YTBOQkU2RHZOMUtsdkRBY1hMN3RodTZhci1rb2RRQg</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu sickens thousands of chickens at NYC poultry markets despite temporary statewide shutdown - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQT1FwNENMNTNwT0NNaHhqaU5tMDBoRnFzQ0tRUk1ucVREeFprSHNyNnNTYVZDVnRodTl6cmJES1pvNklaUnRxTENVdFRKU2ZTUFkydG1hZWdsOFIxSFBwVjZoN2lqcmFSOWN1OFRrcW1ZMXVDRUx2MkVNUWJJUzJjMUJreEItMzlyNUdKUmdwZXZPREt0c3BIdUxCeWdVaE0xb3ZpTkdNNDRhRnFkRkxfN0xJOGRwSllBdTBJUlZBcnFVREs2N2FOdEt4UUJlLUJpbHBV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Bird flu is continuing to spread in New York City despite the state’s temporary live market shut down in February — and activists want a total closure of the slaughter houses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 4,180 Big Apple birds intended to be sold were found to be infected with the highly contagious virus since March 1, according to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hundreds of birds in the Big Apple have been sickened in bird flu outbreaks at various live markets in the past month, The Post has learned. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks were found in live markets with over 1,000 birds in the Bronx and Queens, as well as smaller flocks in Brooklyn and Staten Island. Eleven outbreaks at live markets have been reported in the last eight weeks, or since Feb. 12 – with seven of those markets in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are supposed to be the conditions that have been improved after the governor[‘s] shutdown? This is absolute insanity,” Edita Birnkrant, executive director for animal activist group NYCLASS, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neither the government nor any other public health official has uttered a word about the surge in outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governor Kathy Hochul ordered the shut down and cleaning of all  live poultry markets in New York City in February. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new infections come weeks after Gov. Kathy Hochul &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/07/us-news/nyc-li-live-poultry-markets-shut-down-after-local-cases-of-bird-flu-discovered/#:~:text=NYC%2C%20Long%20Island%20live%20poultry,cases%20of%20bird%20flu%20discovered&amp;amp;text=All%20live%20poultry%20markets%20in,Kathy%20Hochul%20announced%20Friday."&gt;shut down all live poultry markets in New York City,&lt;/a&gt; Long Island and Westchester County, an order that lasted just over one week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite activists urging the governor to shutter the live markets for longer as the virus continued to spread – and even claiming some markets were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/09/us-news/activists-accuse-nyc-shops-of-selling-sickly-chickens-in-scramble-before-bird-flu-shutdown/"&gt;hawking “visibly sickly-looking” chickens&lt;/a&gt; to unsuspecting customers – the ban was lifted on Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same week, the state issued a notice requiring that poultry be tested prior to entering live bird markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, almost immediately after the ban was lifted, 150 birds at a live market in Queens were found to be sickened by the virus on March 3, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Customers select a chicken as an employee prepares to slaughter it inside a poultry store. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activists also reported least one live market in Bushwick, Brooklyn, sporting a dumpster on a public street that was “dripping blood and had rotten chicken corpses inside” in late February, Birnkrant said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The same live market touted chickens in “gruesome, dire condition,” the activist said, including one with an apparent necrotic wound and another gushing blood. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were so many [chickens] in such bad shape, clearly sick,” she added. “We have been informed that the New York State AG department will be investigating these markets . . . but in the meantime, these public health hazards remain, and there are animals suffering horribly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 300 million birds have been killed from the bird flu to date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious virus can also spread to humans, and has infected 70 people in the US, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and validation of the tool was described in a study titled “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58274-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enabling new insights from old scans by repurposing clinical MRI archives for multiple sclerosis research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using MindGlide will enable us to use existing brain images in hospital archives to better understand multiple sclerosis and how treatment affects the brain,” Philipp Goebl, PhD, first author of the study at University College London, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/apr/ai-tool-can-track-effectiveness-multiple-sclerosis-treatments"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope that the tool will unlock valuable information from millions of untapped brain images that were previously difficult or impossible to understand, immediately leading to valuable insights into multiple sclerosis for researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further goal, according to Goebl, is to use MindGlide and other AI tools to help current MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the near future, [we hope] to better understand a patient’s condition through AI in the clinic,” Goebl said. “We hope this will be possible in the next five to 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Patients typically need multiple scans to assess MS damage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages healthy nervous system tissue. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt; are a key tool used to track MS disease progression and determine how a person with the neurodegenerative disease is responding to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On MRI scans, MS-related areas of brain damage are visible as white or dark spots, which are known as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, lesions have been identified by having experts manually examine MRI scans. This approach is time-consuming, however, and getting the best results usually requires experts to look at several different types of MRI scans of the same brain — meaning patients have to sit through multiple scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need for repeated scans is not only inconvenient for patients, but also makes it more logistically difficult to run clinical trials tracking the effects of treatments on lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MindGlide was developed with the aim of creating a tool that could accurately identify lesion load in the brain based on a single MRI scan — regardless of the type of scan. Having such a tool would make the process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, “simplifying MRI analysis, particularly through single [MRI scans], can expand research opportunities from hospital archives, allowing analysis of previously acquired routine-care scans and potentially making clinical trials less costly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other AI tools, MindGlide was developed by first starting with a massive dataset — in this case, the researchers used more than 4,000 MRI scans. These scans were derived from nearly 3,000 people with various types of MS, and acquired with nearly 600 different MRI machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data were fed into a computer alongside a set of mathematical tools, called algorithms, which the computer uses to identify patterns among the information it’s given. By identifying these patterns, the computer is basically able to learn how to identify lesions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;AI tool tested, validated using nearly 15,000 scans from 1,000 patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trained tool was then tested on nearly 15,000 scans from 1,000 patients followed in clinical trials or as part of routine care. The data demonstrated that MindGlide was better than other state of the art computer tools at identifying MS lesions in accordance with expert reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI tool also was effective at determining the effects of treatments in clinical trial data. In one analysis, the researchers compared MS lesion load and brain atrophy, or shrinkage, in people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (PPMS) who were treated with either &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab) or a placebo. This was also done using scans that have never been used for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that patients given Ocrevus had significantly lower increases in lesion volume and slower rates of brain volume loss across different types of scans. The correlation between lesion load and disability levels was greater with MindGlide than with the standard of care AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;We developed and validated [an MRI scan type]-agnostic deep learning model that can quantify MRI biomarkers from routine care and clinical trial datasets from varying single [MRI scans].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other analyses used MindGlide to compare lesion rates in a trial of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/simvastatin-for-spms/"&gt;simvastatin&lt;/a&gt; against a placebo in people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (SPMS). Results using different scans consistently showed no difference in lesion volume changes over time, but a significant slowing in brain volume loss with simvastatin. Consistently, trial data showed that simvastatin &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/24/ectrims-2024-simvastatin-fails-slow-disability-progression-spms/"&gt;failed to slow disability progression&lt;/a&gt; in SPMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We developed and validated [an MRI scan type]-agnostic deep learning model that can quantify MRI biomarkers from routine care and clinical trial datasets from varying single [MRI scans],” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable limitation of the tool, the team noted, is that it only works on MRI scans of the brain — though MS also can cause damage in the spinal cord, which further contributes to disability. Collectively the brain and spinal cord are known as the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future work should expand our approach to the entire central nervous system,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Other diabetes medications, however, were not associated with a change in risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are dementia and diabetes linked?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the average age of the population steadily rises, the number of dementia cases rises in step. Despite decades of intensive research, a cure remains elusive. Although some treatments can slow progress, we are far from a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to these challenges, if an effective drug were found, it would take many years to build up a sufficient evidence base and millions of dollars to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, some researchers are focusing on existing drugs. If they can identify a drug that is already widely used and helps lower the risk of dementia, it would be a much shorter road to wider availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some recent research has suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia may &lt;a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/95808" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share some physiological similarities;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;share some physiological similarities&lt;/a&gt;, including inflammation and impaired insulin signalling in the brain. People with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting question: If a drug reduces the impact of type 2 diabetes, might it also reduce the risk of dementia? Scientists have now investigated this question, and some evidence does suggest that diabetes medication &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13872877251319054" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may reduce dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the authors of the latest study explain, we need more evidence. To build the clearest picture to date, they used “a more rigorous methodological approach and robust adjustment for confounding factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drugs like Ozempic linked to 33% lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists accessed data from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. In total, this amounted to 92,160 people aged 50 or older with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were followed until they died or developed dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159442" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vascular-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vascular dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/316113" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lewy-body-dementia-stages" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lewy body dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on three comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1RA versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGLT2i versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists concluded that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementias compared with second-line diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“GLP-1RA use was associated with a 33% lower risk of [dementia], while SGLT2i use was associated with a 43% lower risk compared with other [glucose-lowering drugs],” the authors write.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://www.fountainlife.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:William Kapp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;William Kapp&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a longevity expert and CEO of Fountain Life, not involved in tis study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapp shared his thoughts on the findings, saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results didn’t shock me — but they did give more credence to what we’ve been observing. Brain and body don’t age separately. Metabolic problems such as insulin resistance are linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered blood flow — all of which impact brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs reduce dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists do not know for sure how GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest some potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, GLP-1RAs have been shown to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SGLT2is may protect the brain by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists also explain that both drugs are associated with improved metabolic and vascular health, both of which may support healthy brain function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is some evidence that these drugs can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2948479/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce levels&lt;/a&gt; of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the brain — the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-two-new-studies-on-diabetes-drugs-including-glp-1rss-and-glucose-lowering-drugs-and-dementia-and-alzheimers-risk-in-people-with-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Media Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science Media Center&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. &lt;a href="https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/2876-david-strain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Strain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Strain&lt;/a&gt;,MD, FRCP, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, similarly not involved in the study, explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 receptor antagonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to control the sugar, and also reduce the inflammation (a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease) and reduce vascular risk (a key driver of vascular dementia) more than would be expected by the sugar control alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore no surprise that these data show a lower risk of dementia in people who receive them as part of her routine care,” Strain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do we have enough data to draw strong conclusions?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which analyzed data from almost 100,000 people is supported by a number of previous studies. However, a paper published in the same journal and on the same day casts a small portion of doubt on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper in question, also published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials including data from 164,531 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its authors, “glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, their conclusions on GLP1-RAs mirror those from the original paper, but they did not find the same effect for SGLT2is. This may be partly due to the short duration of follow-up. The average study follow-up in the meta-analysis and the follow-up in the original study were under 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dementia takes many years to develop, this may not be long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s still early, and we’re still not seeing all the long-term data,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. But what we’re seeing is that regulating insulin and inflammation might also slow down some of the changes in the brain tied to dementia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inevitable next question is: Will these drugs reduce dementia risk in people without diabetes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the benefit is from reducing insulin resistance or inflammation, it’s possible that these drugs could be good for people without diabetes,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; before injecting some caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is good for one group doesn’t mean it is for others. And there are always risks to long-term use,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the jury is — at least in part — out. We may have to wait for longer studies before we can draw solid conclusions. Still, it is looking increasingly likely that GLP1-RAs might reduce the risk of dementia for people with type 2 diabetes, which is certainly a positive finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diabetes-drugs-like-ozempic-or-jardiance-may-slash-alzheimers-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9vNHZGeVA0a2k1aW9CNm1kRm9melNwUE1Nam51WjE3S2FsMmJFSDdta2lLUWhRR3k5VnVoV212MjNCRWZUd2dGX3ByN0tpbE1SUS1WQ3NQeHlrWTV1WUVnMENLUFp1V2VTMWZZZG5nQzVtMlpRcEtNOExLZw</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. says he’s ‘not familiar’ with $11b cuts to state and local health departments - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxORnRvWHNTU3VaRDFnbS1iTDhzUVlMbGNnU0ljS3V6djItR090ZUFzcDB2QlFZUTNYYmcwbllCVVRyNDZTcmxiTU9sTUo0eFNWTHdfUXJMSXEzTnl6OGFYNWtMR2NGbDc4Z1pmY1N1MExHT3Qtb0NtY1F1MWxXeDlJS3BLb2VveTJZaUozS1pWWlc0MEJ60gGaAUFVX3lxTE5nOVl6dURSakRuN09wYVJ5UnhydFF4a09iWjJxR0NydWxFV21VN2MxY0J0YVhmWTdjM3VmLXJLcDhtRmZpbGsyUWxNUkhJeVd4VGhHRzVBQXViclFCNEV3QTJJMllhWHE5OGxFSS1fRGgzeHpoTHBLNk1hVzJnZllLNHJfNEVMUGFxUV83aWFjMndrNEhHVHJxaWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__text | body-copy | flow"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was unaware that his agency is trying to rescind more than $11 billion from state and local health departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No I’m not familiar with those cuts. We’d have to go … the cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president ordered,” Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, parts of which aired Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services last month canceled &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5218628-trump-cancels-health-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tens of billions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars in federal grants that state and local health departments were using to track infectious diseases, health disparities, vaccinations, mental health services and other health issues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HHS said the grants, totaling $11.4 billion, were primarily used for COVID-19 response, including testing, vaccination and hiring community health workers.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State and local officials said the move will make it even harder for them to continue to fight infectious disease outbreaks, fund substance use disorder support programs and address other concerns.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders said the money was already in their hands, and they were using it for much more than just COVID response, including responding to the measles outbreak in Texas.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The funding cuts were &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5231020-federal-judge-temporary-pause-trump-administration-public-health-funding-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;temporarily paused&lt;/a&gt; last week following a lawsuit by Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LaPook asked if Kennedy was aware that his agency had eliminated a $750,000 grant to the University of Michigan focused on adolescent diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said he wasn’t, but said the agency has been fixing mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that’s important,” Kennedy said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear when that grant was cancelled or if it has been reinstated. The Hill has reached out for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the same interview, Kennedy for the first time said people should get the measles shot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I encourage people to get the measles vaccine,” Kennedy said. “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but … the government should not be mandating those.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His comments come as an outbreak primarily among unvaccinated people in West Texas has killed two children and sickened more than 500 people since the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;They are the strongest pro-vaccine comments Kennedy has made in any public remarks since he was sworn in as secretary in January.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in the same interview, Kennedy continued to raise doubts about vaccine safety.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I say they’re not safety tested, what I mean is they’re not adequately — many of the vaccines are tested for only three or four days with no placebo group,” Kennedy said. “I always said during my campaign and every part, every public statement I’ve made: I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”   &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In an X post last weekend made after visiting the epicenter of the outbreak and attending the funeral of one of the children who died, Kennedy wrote that the measles vaccine is the “most effective way to prevent the spread” of the disease. But he stopped short of recommending it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has touted fringe theories about prevention and treatment, like the benefits of vitamin A and cod liver oil over the measles vaccine, which is the only proven way to prevent infection.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he has talked about the shot, he’s framed it as a personal choice while also suggesting the vaccine can cause just as much harm as the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;

Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist and clinical audiologist, explains. If left untreated, this condition can lead to much more serious problems, including hearing loss,  loss of balance and even dementia. Although there's no cure, there are effective treatment options available to significantly reduce — or even eliminate — your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Keith Darrow's books&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow wrote two books, "Silenced: The Medical Treatment of Tinnitus" and "Quiet: Living with Less Noise," where you can learn about what tinnitus is, the latest treatments for tinnitus, hear personal success stories, and discover how early intervention can provide lasting relief for up to 90% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://silencethesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Silenced: The Medical Treatment of Tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;" is designed to provide valuable information for both those living with tinnitus and people who want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will gain insight into the latest treatments, coping strategies, and patient success stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you've been struggling with tinnitus for years or are just starting to notice symptoms, this book offers practical tools to help you improve your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://keap.page/oth387/silenced-medical-treatment-of-tinnitus.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to request your free copy of the book, or call (435) 253-6243&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One successful case study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Ruesch is a Utah resident and one of the many people who's found relief through  Darrow's method of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most people, Ruesch's tinnitus started out fairly mild.  He only noticed ringing in his ears late at night or when things were particularly quiet. But over time, the condition worsened to a point where it started to interfere with his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was sick of the ringing in my head," Ruesch recalls. "I was losing sleep, was not  productive at work, and I was becoming less tolerable to be around at home. I was so  desperate that I tried the magic pills, but nothing seemed to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Ruesch visited his local Excellence in Audiology-certified clinic, &lt;a href="https://www.hearingandbraincenters.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Hearing and Brain Centers&lt;/a&gt; — and that's when things started to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After meeting with Darrow's team to discuss his experience, symptoms and personal goals, Ruesch learned that his tinnitus was the result of hearing damage. According to  Darrow, this is the case for over 90% of all patients suffering from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damage to the ears – be it from age, noise or even medications – can compromise the neural connections from ear to brain and cause a significant increase in neural activity in higher brain centers, which the person then perceives as tinnitus," Darrow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The most effective form of treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the best way to treat tinnitus, research over the past decade has been clear: Hearing treatment plans with ongoing support from a specialist and prescription-grade hearing aids are key to successfully restimulating the auditory system and providing tinnitus relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have discovered that the most effective way to treat tinnitus is to provide direct sound stimulation to the brain," Darrow said. He explained that this allows the brain to rewire and make long-term neural changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Hearing and Brain Centers of America&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruesch learned that treatment for tinnitus wouldn't be an overnight fix. In fact, it could take up to six months. But the work and patience turned out to be worth it as he was among the  80% of patients who experienced direct relief from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now living free from this condition entirely, he sleeps better, he's less anxious and  stressed, and his hearing has improved. And he knows that keeping up with his treatment plan is crucial to maintain these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New bimodal neuromodulation device, Lenire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.excellenceinaudiology.org/lenire-for-tinnitus-relief/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Lenire&lt;/a&gt; for Tinnitus Relief is a non-hearing aid option to manage tinnitus symptoms such as ringing, buzzing, chirping in the ears. Primarily used to supplement the direct treatment of tinnitus in patients who need additional tinnitus support beyond the medical treatment of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It uses a combination of sound therapy and gentle electrical pulses to the tongue to help retrain the brain and reduce the perception of tinnitus. Backed by clinical research,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.excellenceinaudiology.org/lenire-for-tinnitus-relief/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Lenire&lt;/a&gt; offers a safe, at-home solution under professional guidance for those seeking relief from persistent tinnitus symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seek treatment as soon as possible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results, it's important to treat tinnitus as early as possible. If left untreated,  tinnitus will only get worse and could impact other aspects of your life. Knowing how detrimental it can be — and how much better life is after treatment — Reusch is urging anyone and everyone with the condition to get help sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For anybody who's wondering if they should get treatment, specifically those who are suffering from tinnitus, I say do it," Ruesch said.

Other diabetes medications, however, were not associated with a change in risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the average age of the population steadily rises, the number of dementia cases rises in step. Despite decades of intensive research, a cure remains elusive. Although some treatments can slow progress, we are far from a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to these challenges, if an effective drug were found, it would take many years to build up a sufficient evidence base and millions of dollars to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, some researchers are focusing on existing drugs. If they can identify a drug that is already widely used and helps lower the risk of dementia, it would be a much shorter road to wider availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting question: If a drug reduces the impact of type 2 diabetes, might it also reduce the risk of dementia? Scientists have now investigated this question, and some evidence does suggest that diabetes medication &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13872877251319054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;may reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the authors of the latest study explain, we need more evidence. To build the clearest picture to date, they used “a more rigorous methodological approach and robust adjustment for confounding factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists accessed data from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. In total, this amounted to 92,160 people aged 50 or older with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on three comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1RA versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SGLT2i versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists concluded that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementias compared with second-line diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“GLP-1RA use was associated with a 33% lower risk of [dementia], while SGLT2i use was associated with a 43% lower risk compared with other [glucose-lowering drugs],” the authors write.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://www.fountainlife.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;William Kapp&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a longevity expert and CEO of Fountain Life, not involved in tis study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapp shared his thoughts on the findings, saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results didn’t shock me — but they did give more credence to what we’ve been observing. Brain and body don’t age separately. Metabolic problems such as insulin resistance are linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered blood flow — all of which impact brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists do not know for sure how GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest some potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, GLP-1RAs have been shown to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SGLT2is may protect the brain by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists also explain that both drugs are associated with improved metabolic and vascular health, both of which may support healthy brain function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is some evidence that these drugs can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2948479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reduce levels&lt;/a&gt; of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the brain — the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-two-new-studies-on-diabetes-drugs-including-glp-1rss-and-glucose-lowering-drugs-and-dementia-and-alzheimers-risk-in-people-with-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Science Media Center&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. &lt;a href="https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/2876-david-strain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David Strain&lt;/a&gt;,MD, FRCP, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, similarly not involved in the study, explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 receptor antagonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to control the sugar, and also reduce the inflammation (a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease) and reduce vascular risk (a key driver of vascular dementia) more than would be expected by the sugar control alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore no surprise that these data show a lower risk of dementia in people who receive them as part of her routine care,” Strain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which analyzed data from almost 100,000 people is supported by a number of previous studies. However, a paper published in the same journal and on the same day casts a small portion of doubt on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper in question, also published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="JAMA" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials including data from 164,531 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its authors, “glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, their conclusions on GLP1-RAs mirror those from the original paper, but they did not find the same effect for SGLT2is. This may be partly due to the short duration of follow-up. The average study follow-up in the meta-analysis and the follow-up in the original study were under 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dementia takes many years to develop, this may not be long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s still early, and we’re still not seeing all the long-term data,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. But what we’re seeing is that regulating insulin and inflammation might also slow down some of the changes in the brain tied to dementia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inevitable next question is: Will these drugs reduce dementia risk in people without diabetes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the benefit is from reducing insulin resistance or inflammation, it’s possible that these drugs could be good for people without diabetes,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; before injecting some caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is good for one group doesn’t mean it is for others. And there are always risks to long-term use,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the jury is — at least in part — out. We may have to wait for longer studies before we can draw solid conclusions. Still, it is looking increasingly likely that GLP1-RAs might reduce the risk of dementia for people with type 2 diabetes, which is certainly a positive finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:29:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPQ3EzTk1DcHlwQzFNaXpRU0l2VlA0OWx6dGNKZmdvVG50RkY1MWRYYS1rc1J3a3NJSTBwX3JoTEM1VEk3ODczTm5LZTVWa3RtUGdpdEU1RzF4Y1VucUlfeV84bEkxMVN4cUpFZno3WVJfeDdDMGNZQTZPSElxRDI3RlFkd2JXM2RBd3ZqQk05allJeHdPcFZsUmw3U3pHVm1MLV9iV2lXVld4MVZw</guid></item><item><title>New reports suggest diabetes weight loss drugs could reduce Alzheimer's risk - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQnFtM3cyRmhiRE9TZXhDWVVvOHQtQTlSMDhGN1FNUGllcFlwOFJCZGJxQ1NnMVpGQ2tyajhvZ0FUV0NTekkzTzVPWVd4VV9WcmxzanBRYmdnS2wweTNFZ05XVHRoNldrQVRFZzkzYjZ4bFYwVmJaTXplYVItRVpmaUtSclRoLTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide (sold as Ozempic and Wegovy), are now drawing increased attention for their potential to protect brain health. Two recent studies and an editorial in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/i&gt; suggest these medications may help reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

It affects nearly 7 million Americans today and is projected to double by 2060. While newly approved Alzheimer's drugs like lecanemab and aducanumab have garnered attention, concerns over their effectiveness and safety remain. This has intensified interest in repurposing existing drugs that are already widely used and well-tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-cohort study conducted by the University of Florida found that both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were associated with a significantly lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to other diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from over 90,000 patients, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831976" target="_blank"&gt;researchers reported&lt;/a&gt; that GLP-1RA users had a 33% lower risk and SGLT2i users had a 43% lower risk of developing ADRD compared to other glucose-lowering drugs. While SGLT2 inhibitors showed a slightly greater relative reduction, the difference between the two classes was not statistically significant, suggesting both may offer similar protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" target="_blank"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of Galway also supports the idea that GLP-1 receptor agonists may help reduce the risk of dementia. In a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systematic+review/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analysis of 26 randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 164,000 participants, the researchers found a statistically significant association between GLP-1 receptor agonists and reduced dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Unlike the Florida study, the Galway analysis did not find similar benefits for SGLT2 inhibitors or pioglitazone. These findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have a more distinct role in protecting cognitive function compared to other cardioprotective diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide were originally developed to boost insulin secretion, lower blood sugar, and support weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since discovered that GLP-1 receptors are present not only in the pancreas and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gastrointestinal+tract/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gastrointestinal tract&lt;/a&gt;, but also in the brain, heart, and immune system. In animal studies, GLP-1RAs have been shown to reduce brain inflammation, enhance &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/synaptic+plasticity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;, and decrease the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau proteins, which are key features of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831981" target="_blank"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Diana Thiara of the University of California, San Francisco, describes these brain effects as "highly promising," particularly with newer agents like semaglutide, which have stronger and longer-lasting receptor activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are only at the precipice," she writes, referring to ongoing trials of dual and triple hormone agonists that may offer even greater neuroprotective potential in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Major Phase III clinical trials, including EVOKE and EVOKE Plus, are currently underway to evaluate the effects of semaglutide in individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. If these findings are confirmed, they could reshape how clinicians approach both diabetes and dementia, particularly in aging populations where the two conditions often coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists are not without risks. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass, which may be especially concerning for older adults who are already vulnerable to sarcopenia. More rarely, patients may experience pancreatitis, and preclinical studies have raised concerns about a possible risk of thyroid cancer, although this has not yet been observed in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

One person is hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas has 32 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state as of Wednesday, including Morton Stevens, Haskell, Kiowa, Grant, and Gray counties. Finney and Ford county are new to the list with active outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/4/1744217094136.png" alt="Outbreak counties in yellow-KDHE image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Outbreak counties in yellow-KDHE image&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/4/1744217179217.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, the U.S. has more measles cases this year than in all of 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-kansas-ohio-mmr-vaccination-new-mexico-texas-569474272df9baaad1f6d73462ebe92a"&gt;Other states with outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; — defined as three or more cases — include New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio and Oklahoma. Since February, two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multi-state outbreak confirms health experts' fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-6cfda9a944084c390bc70f0e7a37a426"&gt;could stretch on for a year&lt;/a&gt;. The World Health Organization said last week that cases in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need an MMR booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don’t know which type they got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-cdc-outbreak-chicago-mmr-vaccine-7ecdfef41e6dbd659c7ac8b80d5de38f"&gt;a rise in measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, including an outbreak in Chicago that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b"&gt;sickened more than 60.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>JC Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:58:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBMUnRXaFNfMTg5M3pMc1RYVHdhblUyVndYQ3AtSHpTLUtDcl9HQzhHaURsQndWV1ozNmswUWJtWkNMVHlFTDlQM19SYU9qaUFfY0ZhYmdaS25NLVpzVHJGN09RRWJWYmZpV3VfUy1R</guid></item><item><title>This Plant-Based Gum Neutralizes 95% of Flu and Herpes Viruses – And Could Curb the Next Pandemic - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNV3JpTlFtZVFZWTRIellTMlJGRUJ3ckxTbHFkeGtsd0FZdU9OQ2RSVVZVZk9IS1VmV3NBMmVBc2xFakZ2aXlIdnE3Q1JBRTZRZDNZYXEyLTdpM1UxRGNaNWhCRm45Z0ltcWxiUFB6LS1paFJ5RDRGYkdRRk9QRm9JTkk1eldlNFBkbWpmam9pZUhEdTdCcHJzazAySXNDWUxmaHhrQTNQc2NEUEJGdjMwTXBrT1VMcFVrV1Nzbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:09:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNV3JpTlFtZVFZWTRIellTMlJGRUJ3ckxTbHFkeGtsd0FZdU9OQ2RSVVZVZk9IS1VmV3NBMmVBc2xFakZ2aXlIdnE3Q1JBRTZRZDNZYXEyLTdpM1UxRGNaNWhCRm45Z0ltcWxiUFB6LS1paFJ5RDRGYkdRRk9QRm9JTkk1eldlNFBkbWpmam9pZUhEdTdCcHJzazAySXNDWUxmaHhrQTNQc2NEUEJGdjMwTXBrT1VMcFVrV1Nzbw</guid></item><item><title>I was sufficiently vaccinated against measles in childhood – or so I thought - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQNmR3UExEMFdUaDN4TEdXT3R5bGR6TmhDWUxSX0FRdTVuWEk3ZzJ2Z2ZJMHlHQzNfWE1fN05hTnBtWXh6MDFiNzB2RnE3cGEyYzB4Sm9fb2tSLXlzRzBfSl9uRndiSTFrVVNjQV9BU2dCN05lcElITWZHYlFBTmJTQ011eFo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen I enrolled in graduate school at the age of 53, I knew I would probably be the oldest student in class.

primary care physician. “Beautiful,” she said, admiring the yellowed paperwork, which noted one measles vaccine when I was 13 months, the other at 10 years. “But these aren’t official records, so you need a titer test.” A &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible"

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Titer tests, my doctor explained, measure antibody levels in the blood. The results threw me for a loop. My immunity to rubella was sufficient, but mumps and measles antibodies were too low, and I needed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine before stepping foot on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a simple fix, but the incident lingered in my mind. Why were my titers low for measles antibodies despite two rounds of the vaccine? With &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/texas-measles-death-child" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;record outbreaks this year&lt;/a&gt; – 607 in the US as of 3 April 2025 – I wondered if older adults should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-if-i-was-vaccinated-between-1963-and-1967" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What if I was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to Dr Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist, adults who were immunized against measles between 1963 and 1967 – as I was – are at risk. During that period, said Roberts, children received either an inactivated measles vaccine or a live one. The inactivated version was less effective; it was discontinued in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 million people in the US received the inactivated vaccine between 1963 and 1967. (It was tested in clinical trials in the UK but never put into widespread use.) Per my mother’s records, my second measles vaccine was live, but the first one, administered at the end of 1967, was not, which could explain the low titers test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you know you received the inactivated vaccine, said Dr Aniruddha Hazra, a UChicago Medicine infectious disease expert, or don’t know which one you got in the 1960s, “get the MMR vaccine again. There is no harm in getting the shot even if you are fully immunized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Adults can confirm immunity with a titer test, like I did, but the test can cost more than the MMR vaccine. “If you would rather get the titers checked first,” said Hazra, “that’s a conversation to have with your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"5e677e23-c5c2-453e-89ad-d895188dc1fd","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="5e677e23-c5c2-453e-89ad-d895188dc1fd" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But a low titer test doesn’t necessarily mean you’re susceptible to infection. Dr Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, explained that even if vaccinated individuals don’t have detectable circulating antibodies, they probably have memory cells in their immune system ready to produce more antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-if-i-was-born-before-1957" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What if I was born before 1957?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, measles was a major cause of death in children under five. Infection could lead to hearing loss, deafness or debilitating neurological side effects. What is the current recommendation for adults born before the vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Anyone born before 1957 was exposed to measles,” said Hazra. “Based on that, the CDC and ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] said we can assume you were exposed or acquired measles, and measles immunity is lifelong.” This means no additional vaccine is recommended for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="one-shot-or-two" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;One shot or two?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re wondering how many shots you should have had, the answer is slightly muddy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Until 1989, the CDC recommended only one dose of the MMR vaccine for children. Thereafter, a second MMR dose was recommended to help “increase the immune response in the small number of people who didn’t fully respond to the first dose”, said Bednarczyk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC currently recommends two doses of the measles vaccine for children and “one or two” doses for adults, reserving the two-dose recommendation for adults identified as high-risk, such as those in higher learning and healthcare settings, or who are traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One dose is very effective at preventing measles,” said Bednarczyk. “This is important, because many people born before the mid or late 1980s likely only received one dose of the MMR vaccine.” But, he added, people vaccinated prior to the two-dose recommendation benefited from high MMR vaccine uptake, which greatly reduced the risk of large measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vaccination landscape has changed in recent years. Since the 2019-20 school year, vaccination rates amongst school children – targeted for 95% – have fallen dramatically. According to KFF, a non-profit health policy organization, only &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;11 US states&lt;/a&gt; reported vaccination rates of 95% or higher in the 2023-24 school year. Previous vaccination recommendations took into account the fact that measles had been eradicated in the US, said Hazra. “All adults living in the US should be considered high-risk” right now, he says, and should receive two live doses at some point in their life, except for adults born before 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you know you were vaccinated with the two doses of the live vaccine, he says, there is no recommendation for another dose, even in an outbreak or traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-measles-immunity-wane-over-time" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does measles immunity wane over time?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, the US health secretary, remarked &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-rfk-vaccine-immunity/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that immunity from the MMR vaccine “wanes 4.5% a year” and that “older people are essentially unvaccinated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That is factually incorrect,” said Hazra. “If it was true, we would be seeing more measles in people with histories of vaccination.” Hazra stresses the importance of including older adults in the discussion about measles protection; they’re more vulnerable to possible complications from measles infections, which include pneumonia. But all the experts I spoke to warn against widespread misinformation about the measles vaccine. “Levels of antibodies against the measles virus may decline over time,” adds Bednarcdzyk. “But in the cases we’ve seen so far in 2025, only 3% of the cases had documented history of measles vaccine receipt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-side-effects-from-the-mmr-vaccine" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Are there side effects from the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bednarczyk cites “no big differences for adults compared to children” and that side effects usually clear up in a few days. “A lot of these live vaccines elicit a greater immune response for 24-48 hours,” adds Hazra. “The body is mounting an immune response and creating a lot of energy to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most common side effects are fever, soreness and swelling at the site of the injection, headache, muscle aches, tiredness or a mild rash. “In some very rare cases,” said Bednarczyk, “there may be a short-term drop in blood platelet levels after vaccination, which can also happen if you are infected with measles virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2882aa02-374b-4d92-89ab-c15df3f51dd0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":30,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Wonder drug or waste of money?

(By comparison, individuals with seasonal influenza usually infect about two other people.) “Airborne pathogens hang around for two hours,” added Hazra. “It can infect so many people because of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The MMR vaccination is significantly safer than acquiring natural immunity via infection. “Having the measles disease runs the risk of complications later on,” said Nguyen. These include subsequent measles infections from “immune amnesia” and serious complications from measles-related encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Anyone who is unsure about their vaccination status should speak to their healthcare provider about an MMR or titer test. A high level of immunity across the US will help protect everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQNmR3UExEMFdUaDN4TEdXT3R5bGR6TmhDWUxSX0FRdTVuWEk3ZzJ2Z2ZJMHlHQzNfWE1fN05hTnBtWXh6MDFiNzB2RnE3cGEyYzB4Sm9fb2tSLXlzRzBfSl9uRndiSTFrVVNjQV9BU2dCN05lcElITWZHYlFBTmJTQ011eFo</guid></item><item><title>This Alabama city is among the 10 worst for sexually transmitted infections - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AM5IROILMBACTGGNE5MVPRYYLE"&gt;Montgomery is one of the nation’s worst cities for the rate of sexually transmitted infections, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DF4GFYVGF5CV5D4HPQEDB2PTHE"&gt;And Mobile, while lower on the list, is not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LE7XEN7ILFGFRAQLVR7IMF4UVI"&gt;In their 8th annual study on national STI data, the Innerbody Research Institute found that over 60% of the top 25 metropolitan areas with the highest STI rates are in the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKJLUM3IAZFWRKPUNB2WJCYZAE"&gt;Although Detroit, Mich., is home to the highest rate of STIs, with 1,491 cases per 100,000 residents, nearly half of the remaining top ten rankings are in the South -- including Montgomery, which ranks third with 1,446 cases of sexually transmitted diseases per 100,000 residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LVB5DFN5NBH45NWJ7Z74J3WSEA"&gt;Cases of chlamydia account for the highest number in Alabama’s capital city, with 3,363 over the past year, followed by gonorrhea with 1,771 cases; 204 cases of syphilis; and 97 cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="74OMY6XTNBB6LLJMBMTBGLZXSY"&gt;Mobile ranks 11th on the list with 1,277 STI cases per 100,000 residents.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia pudding is the most underrated breakfast for increasing your fiber intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation, support heart health and protect brain health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This meal-prep-friendly breakfast can be customized to the flavors of your choosing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber-filled breakfasts, oatmeal often steals the spotlight—but there’s another option that’s nutrient-dense, versatile and surprisingly easy to overlook: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Made with just a few pantry staples, chia pudding is a fiber-packed meal that’s simple to prepare the night before and endlessly customizable. Whether you’re looking to improve your gut health, stay full through the morning or just streamline your morning routine, here’s why chia pudding should be your go-to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-seriously-high-in-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Seriously High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds may be tiny, but they pack a major fiber punch. Just 1 ounce of chia seeds (about 2½ tablespoons) delivers an impressive 10 grams of dietary fiber—about 36% of the recommended daily intake for most adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of chia seeds alongside fruit, which bumps the fiber to 11 grams per serving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of the fiber in chia seeds is soluble fiber, which forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows digestion and promotes fullness. Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., RDN, a nutrition expert and host of the &lt;a href="https://wendybazilian.com/podcast" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;1,000 Waking Minutes podcast&lt;/a&gt;, says, “Human clinical trials have shown that this gel-like fiber delays gastric emptying, promotes regular bowel movements and may contribute to helping with satiety and fullness after meals.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bazilian also points to a study finding that chia has the ability to convert glucose into a slow-release carbohydrate and keep you fuller longer, even more so than flax—possibly because its fiber forms a thicker, more gel-like texture in the gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-rich-in-omega-3-fatty-acids"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are one of the best plant-based sources of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that support heart, brain and overall health. They’re especially high in ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which the body can convert into other important omega-3s called DHA and EPA—the ones most people associate with fatty fish. While that conversion isn’t super efficient, Bazilian notes a growing understanding suggesting the body may convert just what it needs, with regular turnover to help maintain healthy levels over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ALA has important benefits of its own, too. In fact, higher ALA intake has been linked to lower inflammation, healthier cholesterol levels and reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For anyone following a more plant-based or flexitarian diet, chia seeds are a simple way to meet omega-3 needs in just 2 tablespoons a day. A 1-ounce serving of chia seeds provides about 5 grams of ALA—well above the recommended daily intake of 1.1 grams for women and 1.6 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-perfect-for-meal-prep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Perfect for Meal Prep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia pudding may be one of the easiest breakfasts you can make. It requires no cooking, just a quick stir of chia seeds into your favorite milk, and a little time in the fridge. Once chilled for a few hours or overnight, the seeds absorb the liquid and thicken into a creamy, pudding-like texture. It keeps well in the fridge for up to three days, making it perfect for prepping a few puddings ahead of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-versatile-and-customizable"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Versatile and Customizable &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best parts about chia pudding is how easy it is to make it your own. Start with the base recipe, and from there you can switch up the flavors and toppings depending on what you’re in the mood for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try mixing in different fruits like sliced bananas, berries or peaches, or various nuts like almonds, pistachios or walnuts. Stir in a dash of cinnamon or cocoa powder for extra flavor, or stir in a spoonful of creamy peanut butter for an extra protein boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-eating-more-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Eating More Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The daily recommended amount of fiber ranges from about 25 to 38 grams depending on age and sex. Chia pudding is a great way to start your day with fiber, but it’s important to prioritize fiber throughout the entire day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Bazilian puts it, “It’s the small, consistent additions that add up to big benefits for digestion, blood sugar balance and satiety.” Here are a few simple ways to get more fiber into your meals and snacks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Seeds and Nuts:&lt;/strong&gt; Toss chia, flax, hemp or pumpkin seeds onto smoothies, salads and yogurt. A couple of tablespoons can add several grams of fiber, alongside healthy fats and protein. Basilian says, even small additions—like a tablespoon of chia seeds in a smoothie with 5 grams of fiber—can make a meaningful impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Whole Grains:&lt;/strong&gt; Swapping white bread, pasta and rice for whole-grain varieties is a small change but something that can make a big difference over time. Try options like quinoa, farro, brown rice, bulgur or whole-grain bread and cereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Half Your Plate with Fruits and Vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegetables and fruits, especially when you eat the skin, are excellent sources of fiber. Aim to include a fruit or vegetable at every meal, and mix up the colors to get a larger range of nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean on Legumes:&lt;/strong&gt; Legumes like lentils, black beans, chickpeas and kidney beans are loaded with both fiber and plant-based protein. They’re an easy, budget-friendly way to increase your fiber intake. Toss them into soups, stews, salads or grain bowls for a filling and nutritious upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Remarkably, the device simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for newborns, the pacemaker could transform temporary heart care after congenital defect surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-controlling-the-heart-with-light"&gt;Controlling the heart with light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new pacemaker is smaller than a grain of rice. It’s wirelessly activated through pulses of light which are delivered by a soft, wearable device mounted on the patient’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external controller detects abnormal rhythms and sends light through the body to activate the pacemaker and restore heartbeat. The study demonstrates the device’s effectiveness across animal and human donor hearts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the pacemaker was led by John A. Rogers, a professor of material science, biomedical engineering, and neurological surgery at &lt;a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body – the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solution-designed-for-newborns"&gt;Solution designed for newborns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the light-activated pacemaker can function in patients of all sizes, its miniaturized design was motivated by the needs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/infant-speech-is-driven-by-heart-rate-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Igor Efimov is a co-leader of the study and experimental cardiologist at Northwestern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/worlds-smallest-robot-could-transform-minimally-invasive-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt;. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical,” said Efimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional pacemakers require surgery and have wires sticking out of the chest to connect to an external device. When they are no longer needed, the wires are removed – risking bleeding, tissue damage, or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov explained. “When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new injectable pacemaker addresses these risks. All of its components are biocompatible and bioresorbable, meaning they safely dissolve in the body’s fluids without needing surgical removal.

Surgeons asked for a smaller version to allow easier placement and suit the smallest patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original device used near-field communication (NFC), but its antenna limited how small the device could be made. To overcome this, the team replaced the NFC system with a novel light-based mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/09091552/pacemaker_light-activated_worlds-smallest_heart-health_Northwestern_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/09091558/pacemaker_light-activated_worlds-smallest_heart-health_Northwestern_1s.webp" alt="The tiny pacemaker sits next to a single grain of rice on a fingertip.

Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of using the radio frequency scheme for wireless control, we developed a light-based scheme for turning the pacemaker on and delivering stimulation pulses to the surface of the heart. This is one feature that allowed us to dramatically reduce the size,” said Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powered-by-the-body-s-own-fluids"&gt;Powered by the body’s own fluids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers also reimagined how to power the tiny pacemaker. Rather than requiring a battery or external power source, the device uses a simple galvanic cell – a chemical battery formed by two different metals as electrodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the device is inside the body, surrounding biofluids act as the electrolyte, allowing electrical current to flow and stimulate the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch,” explained Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-trauma-and-risk"&gt;Reducing trauma and risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using infrared light, which can safely penetrate deep into the body, the wearable controller detects when a patient’s heart rate falls too low. It then triggers a light-emitting diode (LED) to flash on and off at the desired pacing rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov said. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its microscopic size – just 1.8 mm wide, 3.5 mm long, and 1 mm thick – the pacemaker delivers stimulation on par with traditional devices. “The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-of-heart-care"&gt;A new era of heart care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these light-activated pacemakers are so small and wireless, doctors could one day deploy multiple units on different parts of the heart to create more advanced pacing systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each device could be controlled independently using different light wavelengths, enabling personalized and precisely timed stimulation across the heart’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can deploy a number of such small pacemakers onto the outside of the heart and control each one,” Efimov said. “Then we can achieve improved synchronized functional care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Rogers noted that because it’s so small, the pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also demonstrated integration of collections of these devices across the frameworks that serve as transcatheter aortic valve replacements to address complications that can occur during a patient’s recovery process,” said Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-bioelectronic-medicine"&gt;Future of bioelectronic medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this breakthrough has clear implications for pediatric heart care, the technology could pave the way for a new generation of bioelectronic medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny, dissolvable devices could one day be adapted to promote nerve and bone regeneration, manage &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-meditation-is-a-powerful-weapon-against-chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, support wound healing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern engineers shrank the device and removed risks by making it dissolve after use.  In doing so, they’ve created a tool that could reshape how doctors care for the heart – from the tiniest patients to adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/j_0hZ8cUwgo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;watch a video interview…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:24:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQcDlIa2ZXWW9oYlY2Uk1WNEZMZVM4cUg3ZWZrTFliQzlmZ2U1dDBOdVNhcngzQ0pEQ3hVd0NNYWZvaFNGNnRIWHhpMGRmTFViYm9VZlhZUGhGTjl5RG1BdzlWbzh4SGhHUF9zaFotN3ZKQnlqRm9QblZBVjdRWEYwbzdlZHBVNUs4aWxvemkteTRfY01QWmtJNzJjamkwSnVRWjJHS3pjeDN4eU1DQUE</guid></item><item><title>Weight loss without dieting?

The surprising truth about fiber and fat loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Navneet Deora, PhD in Food at Bluetribe, shared, “Due to the nature of fibres in terms of its functionality and solubility in water it can be broadly classified as soluble or insoluble and fermentable or non-fermentable. Solubility depends on the extent to which the fibre dissolves in water or forms a gel. Fermentability relates to whether the undigested fibres that reach the large intestine are fermented by anaerobic bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids and gases such as methane and hydrogen. The type of fibre does play a critical role in the area of weight management.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/08/26/Pictures/_a823ad1c-a922-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)" title="Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Substantial research has been conducted to ascertain the relationship between fibre and weight management and typically it shows an inverse relationship between dietary fibre intake and change in body weight. Dr Navneet Deora explained, “Dietary fibre’s ability to decrease body weight or attenuate weight gain could be attributed to several factors. Under conditions of fixed energy intake, the majority of studies indicate that an increase in either soluble or insoluble fibre intake increases post-meal satiety and decreases subsequent hunger.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What fiber really does to your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Navneet Deora elaborated, “For example, soluble fibre, when fermented in the large intestine, produces glucagon-like peptides and peptides. These two gut hormones play a role inducing satiety. Second, dietary fibre may significantly decrease energy intake. It is important to understand that dietary fibre still contributes to the total caloric content of a diet, it is much more resistant to digestion by the small intestine and even somewhat resistant in the large intestine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the expert, consumption of insoluble fibre decreases energy digestibility while it increases with soluble fibre intake. Dr Navneet Deora said, “The mode of action behind these findings may be due to the fact that insoluble fibre causes an increased rate of passage through the GI tract. This would be expected to result in diminished digestion and absorption of nutrients. This both soluble and insoluble fibre may lead to weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/09/23/550x309/kokum_recipes_thumb_1663940453719_1663940461966_1663940461966.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)" title="Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there seems to be a relationship between the type of diet (high or low fat) and the type of fibre consumed. Dr Navneet Deora highlighted, “Insoluble fibre may play a more important role for weight loss during consumption of a high fat diet. Since resistant starch is a constituent of dietary fibre and undergoes the same digestion as insoluble fibre, comparing resistant starch and insoluble fibre may give us a better understanding of how dietary fibre can be used to treat and prevent obesity. Thus, although increasing dietary fibre in general has a favourable effect on body weight, more research is warranted to determine the optimal dietary fibres for the purpose of weight management.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association Eating Plan suggests aiming for 25 to 30 grams of dietary fibre daily from food sources which translates to aprox 14 g/1000 kcal in children and adults. Dr Navneet Deora opined, “The diets with a high content of fibre, such as those rich in cereals, fruits and vegetables have a positive effect on health since their consumption has been related to a decreased incidence of several types of diseases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded, “Its beneficial effects are decreasing the time of intestinal transit, cholesterol and glycaemic levels, trapping substances that can be dangerous for the human organism (mutagenic and carcinogenic agents), stimulating the proliferation of the intestinal flora etc. Diets can have a variety of fibre rich foods (both soluble and insoluble) such as wheat straw, oats, soy bran, rice bran, apples, legumes, mucilaginous fibre.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Frail people are much more likely to die young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This one is much more subjective, but &lt;/span&gt;Dr Bickman believes Ozempic could lead to people becoming 'mentally fragile'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights anecdotal evidence from patients who say that Ozempic not only dulled their cravings for food, but also for other pleasures in life such as sex, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-fe7d7ce0-154c-11f0-b126-f329c23c217c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, coffee and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ben Bickman, pictured, says that people should be weary of the outfall that will come with weight loss medications and he predicts three crippling failures of Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bickman says: 'The benefit in reducing cravings for sweet food may actually be a reduction in cravings for life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He fears patients could succumb to depression as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pointing to one study, Dr Bickman reveals: 'Patients on the drug experience a 195 percent increased risk of major depression and over 100 per cent greater risk of suicidal behavior.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, another investigation which looked at a World Health Organization database that tracks suspected adverse drug reactions, and found that there was a 45 percent greater rate of reports of suicidal thoughts associated with semaglutide compared with all other drugs in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, countering these findings the FDA released a statement in January 2024 saying it had found no connection between the drugs and suicidal thoughts and in April of the same year. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next up, Dr Bickman claims that in the long run, weight loss medications have the potential to make people fatter than they were in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explaining how people go on to regain weight after taking Ozempic for a period of time, he says: 'Ozempic is effective at reducing cravings... However well this works, it works until it doesn't. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At around two years of use, people find that the sweet cravings return to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Interestingly, this is also when many people decide to quit the drug and about 70 percent of users stop the drug at two years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study Dr Bickman refers to, which included an analysis of US pharmacy claims provided to Reuters, did not include details about why patients quit but costs could come into play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic carries a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And touching on his theories around weight gain, a 2022 clinical trial following about 200 people who had taken semaglutide for more than a year and lost an average of 17 percent of their body weight, looked at what happened when they stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that they regained about 12 percent of their body weight within a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another recent study by Northwestern University found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide regained about two-thirds of the weight lost and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Continuing on the subject, Dr Bickman adds: 'While muscle and bone mass might never return, the body has no trouble regaining fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What's more, one study found that one version of these drugs, actually stimulates the production of new fat cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This becomes a problem because when a person start to regain fat mass after stopping Ozempic, with more fat cells comes a greater potential to gain more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, even though a person may still weight less than they did before starting the drug, they may be fatter, with a higher percentage of body fat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his concerns around the side effects of Ozempic and other &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-991e5000-1546-11f0-b126-f329c23c217c"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; drugs, Dr Bickman highlights that he is not against them but it is more the dosing that he is concerned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults with type 2 diabetes take Ozempic once per week to lower blood sugar levels, and they usually begin with a 0.25mg dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lower dose allows the body to become accustomed to the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At week five, doctors typically increase the dose to 0.5 mg once a week if the patient tolerates the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss patients typically follow the same dosing schedule, but their doses might may be increased to as much as 2 mg once weekly and Dr Bickman believes these amounts are too high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking on a podcast with health influencer Thomas DeLauer about the positives and negatives of weight loss drugs, Dr Bickman explains: 'I'm not [opposed to these drugs]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Bickman's hope is that weight loss drugs can be used more responsibly to reduce the possibility of any negative repercussions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When they were in their original dose I actually looked at them as one of the more remarkable drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At this original lower dose I considered this to actually be a favorable balance... [something that] is really helping people control their blood sugar levels andthe fact that it would help with their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But now] that we've gone to these literal multiples and doses becoming higher the  harder it's getting for me to look at them favorably.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bickman's hope is that weight loss drugs can be used more responsibly to reduce the possibility of any negative repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'They should be used at the lowest possible dose that shows efficacy in controlling carbohydrate addictions and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Users should also be encouraged to prioritize dietary protein and fat, especially from animal-sourced foods such as dairy, meat, and eggs, to help build their strength, while frequent strength training can help prevent any loss of lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And finally, patients should be encouraged to stop the drug after a period of use, at which time they assess their cravings for carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ideally, a person has learned how to eat better and control carb cravings and their weight loss can be sustained in the long run.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:48:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Women should avoid all alcohol to reduce risk of breast cancer, charity says - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOTzFEV09Qb2hKS200R2lzTngyM044Y0M3bHBCSkVneWNCR09OOE4xekFPdXRNVXdGUE85OGVjMDk0S1NySlFaN2JBRV9KUE5UNkh1YjhLaXFRVG9BU2t4XzU1a2R5WlRjYUdKMF9KOEVTd25MSGYxU0pKVmZlZUJqUERXd1NKQ0V1c2RRVTRQRXVCNXFkemZuZVBrOThYSDRuTk1wemhaTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women should avoid alcohol altogether to reduce their risk of breast cancer, a charity has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;

In mice, researchers found that different regions of the thalamus—the brain’s sensory hub—respond uniquely depending on whether the animal actively explored with its whiskers or passively received a touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one part of the thalamus was engaged in both types of touch, the posterior medial thalamus primarily responded to passive stimuli, especially when those touches were unexpected. This separation likely helps animals interpret and react appropriately to environmental cues, including potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Active and passive touch are processed in different thalamic regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POm Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; The posterior medial thalamus is especially reactive to passive and unexpected touches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Separating touch types may help animals distinguish between self-directed actions and external threats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though the sense of touch underlies how we and most other animals interact with the world around us, much remains unknown about how this sense is processed in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Heidelberg University and Ludwig Maximillan University Munich in Germany measured the neuronal activity differences between active touch and passive touch in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108524"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand holding a brain and another reaching out to touch it." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Processing these types of touch in different regions of the brain may allow animals to respond quickly and appropriately in their natural environments. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported April 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers find that active and passive touch are processed by different pathways in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active touch can be thought of as grabbing something with your hand, while passive touch would be something brushing against you. Mice, as well as many other animals, use their whiskers to sense the world around them, much like how we use our fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actively touch something, mice move their whiskers around, “whisking” the object they are investigating. They also passively sense touch through their whiskers when an object touches them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured whisker movement and neuronal activity in the mice, focusing on the thalamus, the part of the brain that processes all senses except for smell. The mice either actively interacted with an object or the researchers delivered a puff of air to passively stimulate the whiskers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baseline activity of the thalamus was generally higher before the mice engaged in active touching, and one part of the thalamus responded to both active and passive touch. However, another part called the posterior medial thalamus primarily responded to passive touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This region also had the highest activity when long intervals had passed between puffs of air, which the researchers propose may be connected to the mouse’s surprise at the touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touch is important for many essential activities from finding food to social interaction. Passive touch, in particular, can also help animals sense danger, such as a predator lurking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing these types of touch in different regions of the brain may allow animals to respond quickly and appropriately in their natural environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Being touched and touching something can lead to the same primary sensation but mean entirely different things. We explored how active and passive touch are represented differently in the brain and find that the higher-order thalamus (POm) strongly differentiates these situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this tactile perception and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#55373c3a393a322c25273026261525393a267b3a2732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Active and passive touch are differentially represented in the mouse somatosensory thalamus&lt;/a&gt;” by Anton Sumser et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active and passive touch are differentially represented in the mouse somatosensory thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active and passive sensing strategies are integral to an animal’s behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the neuronal circuitry that underpins these strategies, particularly at the thalamus level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated how active versus passive whisker deflections are represented in single neurons of the ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) and the posterior medial thalamus (POm) in awake mice. These are the first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei of the whisker system, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPM neurons robustly responded to both active and passive whisker deflections, while POm neurons showed a preference for passive deflections and responded poorly to active touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response disparity could not be explained by stimulus kinematics and only in part by the animal’s voluntary whisking state. In contrast, cortical activity significantly influenced POm’s responses to passive touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of the barrel cortex strongly attenuated whisker responses in POm and simultaneously increased the whisking phase coding. This suggests that POm receives touch information from the cortex which strongly adapts and is gated by rare events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest two thalamic relay streams, where VPM robustly relays both active and passive deflection, while POm’s sensitivity requires top-down cortical involvement to signal salient events such as unexpected deflections, originating in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:09:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE44R1ZaZ1Y3SVZfUkxqaHFDbjVQZUdUaURUZ1I5d2hJME9INTYyaFZsZXN5Z2lLVVRzdGV5NUhLR3c1dDYwZnVGVUtpTnFUYmVFMkxFT1pIUGR3Xy13OS1WaUlpb0lfM3ltTWY5ZA</guid></item><item><title>As opiate addiction retains its grip, Twin Cities first responders are turning to another remedy - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOWTcydEt1M1AwLVd0OTFvTnMtWHI1UWZVSjZMY0FwLV9lOWFpN204Rzd4LVRWcmRULVg4ZnNkMUFPU3F3VFV2dk1LTmNhd2taUW5LNFNIWDdveUd1eENjdUhGeHlTWG1ZcGJFWHhFRHlxWXQtbEM1a0dPVWpKN2dNNWMtUE43eHRWQzNybGFTTERjSUlkN2R6RENSN3NiY25HUzk0Ul8weGpYSUQzYWNQNGI5dVUzVXdrbWJGdG8tTm53TkdyNFNJd2FfWnBTQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Dr. Tim Kummer, assistant medical director for Hennepin EMS, said Hennepin County’s results offer a glimpse at what can be fixed through emergency services. Kummer said many clinicians hesitate to use buprenorphine because of the X-waiver, a federal requirement for professionals treating opioid use disorder that was &lt;a href="https://www.acep.org/news/acep-newsroom-articles/x-waiver-no-longer-required-to-treat-opioid-use-disorder" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.acep.org/news/acep-newsroom-articles/x-waiver-no-longer-required-to-treat-opioid-use-disorder"&gt;removed in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.

And there’s been a lot of bad things that’s happened,” Kummer said. “These marginalized communities don’t have access to healthcare, so they’re left with nothing but emergency care. Which is why it’s even more important that we are the ones who are leading the charge on this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box grid gap-2 col-span-full md:col-span-8"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Box font-utility-meta-reg-02 text-text-secondary col-span-full"&gt;HCMC paramedic Jackson Thiets reaches for supplies within an ambulance, describing opiate withdrawal symptoms that often lead patients to a fatal overdose.

The states in the study were not specified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maryland's group A invasive strep &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/oideor/cidsor/pages/disease-conditions-count-rates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;case rate&lt;/a&gt; was 3.31 per 100,000 residents in 2014.

There were 198 cases in 2014 and 697 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures only count the confirmed cases of invasive group A strep. The total GAS infections are even higher, but many cases aren't trackable. Health officials only track serious cases that require investigation, like when the patient is hospitalized, but there are other ways GAS bacteria can enter the body and create a milder infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There is definitely plenty of Group A strep circulating that doesn't get reported to us," Megan Pringle, Anne Arundel County Department of Health spokesperson, told Patch in a Tuesday email. "For example, non-invasive infections, such as strep throat and impetigo, aren't reportable unless there is an outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health could not provide a comment before publication. Patch will update this story if the agency replies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among those at the greatest risk of infections are adults 65 and older, American Indian or Alaska Native persons, residents of long-term care facilities, people experiencing homelessness, and people who inject drugs. Cases did not go up among children, as they did in 2022, when the CDC issued an alert on a&lt;a href="https://patch.com/us/across-america/strep-linked-2-u-s-pediatric-deaths-europe-also-sees-increases"&gt; spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who have group A strep infections can experience “very, very rapid deterioration” within 24 to 48 hours, going to feeling as if they have the flu to “fearing for their recovery” after emergency hospitalization in the ICU, Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/invasive-strep-infections-doubled-us-cdc-study-finds-rcna199759" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the 21,000 patients whose cases were reviewed, nearly 2,000 people died over the period of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet told NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections, both in the general and high-risk populations, the authors said. A couple of possible explanations for the rapid increase in strep A are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rising rates of obesity and diabetes among older adults, which can cause skin infections and compromise immunity; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rising rates of IV drug use, which can allow the bacteria to directly enter the bloodstream. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rise of infections among people experiencing homelessness — 807 per 100,000 — was “among the highest ever documented worldwide,” Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, told NBC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lifestyle choices aren’t the only factor. The bacteria itself is expanding and becoming more diverse, exploiting new opportunities for infection and increasingly becoming resistant to antibiotics used to treat strep infections, according to the study. New strains in recent years are more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have called for a vaccine against group A strep infections given the growing antibiotic resistance of the bacteria. However, Nizet told NBC that may not be feasible with top vaccine scientists leaving the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The lack of vaccine is devastating,” Nizet said. “Of course, we’re concerned about the turn of attitudes at the FDA and the CDC that seem to be putting some sticks in the spokes of the wheel of vaccine development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;invited commentary&lt;/a&gt;, Joshua Osowicki, of the Royal Children’s Hospital in Australia, and Theresa L. Lamagni, of the U.K. Health Security Agency in London, noted that while other high-income countries are experiencing increasing rates of invasive strep A cases, “the scale and character of the rise in North America is particularly alarming and illuminates the extent to which invasive GAS disease thrives in settings of social disadvantage and marginalization.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The pattern is evident in a shift in age distribution, with the CDC reporting that invasive GAS infection is more common in young adults now than in young children, along with high incidence rates among people experiencing homelessness, people who inject drugs, residents of long-term care facilities, and Indigenous peoples, particularly American Indian and Alaska Native individuals,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/maryland/odenton/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:06:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVmNSVEhxQnRPQ1hISGF6VzlSNTN2RVVqVllTVzg2bWtTR1pKRk9MZDZVVS1JbmhHN0J5b1UwY1g5XzFYVnZKbkNyRGhCQnZRMFdKeW1FMTRiWU16bjVjZ1BxelhnQ3FkQzNLbXZYeV8wTmRCMjRLcUZGeUhyUVUtRXI5S3BCWENBSm1NOHAwdWdzQdIBrwFBVV95cUxOeDBVWEx5ekdyS3ZySHBVTnl3cGZ5S3Z3NXZkV3FtalMwTFl6Q1hJNmJNM1E4REJMYzduTTlYOGtNdFRQY0xmRnJQS2piVGx6MlA4ZmhoMW5BZEw0aVoxN2o4SzhERDM2OFhSQjdNNHJKdk9tZVNSVHBHR3VKelJITmsxX1cya0RVaS14azJ5ekc4SFM0eXJPWmZBMG1jRmtrNG9DYmZybGt5QjJoczJF</guid></item><item><title>Eye Clues May Reveal Early Dementia Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uejlzTm9TbGZKX09FTDByS3o4dHY3TUNqdWFmSlpKNnZvRWJqZlpwTFNCUXlldVdPVTJEMTh3Q1ptRVlrYlFYNXhHeUlYOG9LeDBKSEp1T3EtRG8yY3hFTWlqLVEwc3RJdmdwOVpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has found that blood vessels in the retina may hold early clues about a person’s risk of developing dementia. Researchers observed that narrower arterioles, wider venules, and thinner retinal nerve fiber layers were linked to higher dementia risk around midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These eye changes may mirror brain changes tied to Alzheimer’s, offering a non-invasive way to detect risk earlier than current cognitive tests allow.

Measures of retinal health could offer accessible and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with ADRD risk is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of ADRD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017–2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes (CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk index, the DunedinARB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (βs = 0.16–0.31; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.001). Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (βs = 0.05–0.08; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s = 0.02–0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk among middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:40:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uejlzTm9TbGZKX09FTDByS3o4dHY3TUNqdWFmSlpKNnZvRWJqZlpwTFNCUXlldVdPVTJEMTh3Q1ptRVlrYlFYNXhHeUlYOG9LeDBKSEp1T3EtRG8yY3hFTWlqLVEwc3RJdmdwOVpn</guid></item><item><title>'Fingerprints of cancer' found after scientists flash infrared light pulses at blood samples - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPZXlpRjZSbGppeUM1OHdqSFpvZlg3RW5ObTd5TUNEeXZ3MU9YcUl3VUpFOVRwUHpmVkJmb080UC04LTVVX0h6NzIzRF9VVnFpQUN0eVRBcUpoX3pPRGc3Ump2NndrREpLWG5Xb1hQUkV1bmhUdk03QjJRWHFkMVluSnRKSGVoMVZla2RsNEhldkFnVHBtaXE0MU4tWmV1V0hpWWhHNEtWUERsSWJnck9YQzNaSzQ5bS1reWVET3F0dGdockVrbVl1dDg0MVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashes of infrared light can detect signs of cancer in a patient's blood, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, scientists demonstrated that a test using infrared light can detect the difference between blood samples from patients with lung cancer and samples from those without the disease with up to 81% accuracy. They presented their findings in a study published April 9 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c02164" target="_blank" data-url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c02164" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test is powered by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AI) and examines differences in molecules found in blood plasma, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watery portion of blood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that carries various proteins and chemical compounds — such as hormones and vitamins — around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood samples are exposed to flashes of infrared light from a laser, the molecules held within the plasma vibrate. In turn, different components of the molecules absorb or reflect the energy from the light pulses, and consequently, they emit their own distinctive pattern of light that can be recorded and read as an "infrared molecular fingerprint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/detecting-cancer-in-minutes-possible-with-just-a-drop-of-dried-blood-and-new-test-study-hints" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/detecting-cancer-in-minutes-possible-with-just-a-drop-of-dried-blood-and-new-test-study-hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting cancer in minutes possible with just a drop of dried blood and new test, study hints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fingerprint differs between patients with cancer and those without the disease, the researchers reported.

This cohort included patients with lung, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/45406-prostate-cancer.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/45406-prostate-cancer.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prostate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34706-breast-cancer-symptoms-treatment-prevention.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34706-breast-cancer-symptoms-treatment-prevention.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;breast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or bladder cancer who had not yet been treated for their disease. For each patient with cancer, the researchers showed the AI a blood sample from a person of the same sex and of a similar age who didn't have cancer, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training their AI model using these data, the researchers tested how accurate it was at identifying cancer fingerprints in the plasma of about 430 people who weren't included in the initial data. The researchers found that the model was up to 81% accurate at discerning plasma samples from patients with lung cancer compared with those from individuals without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the model was much less successful at detecting the other three types of cancer included in the study. For example, the model only detected around 50% of breast cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering these limitations of the test, much more research will be needed before it could ever be used in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers behind the test are hopeful about its prospects. They now plan to train the model on a wider range of cancers, using data from more patients, to see if they can improve its accuracy in detecting cancer. They especially want to hone its ability to detect cancer at different stages of the disease, they said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers synthesized decades of global data to better understand how maternal diabetes may influence the developing fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results paint a consistent and concerning picture: even after adjusting for major confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, maternal age, and birth complications, maternal diabetes remained robustly associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping Review, Striking Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO and spanning four major research databases, included studies published up to December 2024. Collectively, these studies followed over 56 million mother–child pairs, making this the largest and most comprehensive investigation of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies that adjusted for multiple confounding factors, children exposed to maternal diabetes were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to have intellectual disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16–20% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with learning, communication, or motor disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held whether the diabetes was gestational (developing during pregnancy) or pre-gestational (existing prior to pregnancy). However, the risk was markedly higher for pre-gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children exposed to pre-gestational diabetes had a 39% increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, compared to an 18% increased risk among those exposed to gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Effects Extend Beyond Diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to clinical diagnoses, children born to mothers with diabetes also showed significantly lower average scores in measures of intelligence and psychomotor development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These deficits, though variable, suggest that the impact of maternal diabetes may extend well beyond formal diagnostic thresholds, affecting a range of cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the studies included in the analysis—84%—focused on outcomes in children and adolescents up to the age of 18, providing a long-term view of how early exposures may shape brain function across childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the review did not explore mechanistic pathways directly, prior research has pointed to several plausible biological explanations. These include altered glucose and insulin levels in utero, increased oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and epigenetic changes—all of which can interfere with critical periods of fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, while this meta-analysis demonstrates a strong association, it does not establish causality. The authors caution that additional high-quality, prospective studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms at play and disentangle the contributions of genetics, environment, and prenatal metabolic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the consistency of the findings across dozens of studies, populations, and methodologies lends considerable weight to the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the global rise in diabetes and gestational diabetes rates—driven in part by increasing maternal age and obesity—the findings carry major public health implications. Early identification and monitoring of children born to diabetic mothers may allow for timely intervention, potentially improving cognitive and developmental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the results may inform clinical care guidelines, encouraging tighter glycemic control before and during pregnancy and prompting clinicians to counsel expectant mothers more thoroughly about potential neurodevelopmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Call for Continued Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the strength of the evidence, much remains unknown. Are some neurodevelopmental disorders more sensitive to metabolic disruptions than others? Does the timing of diabetic onset in pregnancy matter? Can interventions during gestation mitigate these risks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors argue that future research should not only explore these questions but also examine potential protective factors and interventions that could buffer developing brains from the effects of maternal metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this research adds urgency to a growing body of literature emphasizing the lifelong consequences of maternal health during pregnancy—not just for mothers, but for their children’s developing brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this gestational diabetes and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00036-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 202 observational studies comprising 56·1 million pregnancies&lt;/a&gt;” by Wenrui Ye et al. &lt;em&gt;Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 202 observational studies comprising 56·1 million pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal diabetes might alter fetal brain development. However, well-designed systematic analyses are needed to comprehensively assess and quantify the association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to synthesise and evaluate the available evidence on the effects of maternal diabetes on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and EBSCO databases from inception to Dec 1, 2024, for studies exploring neurodevelopmental outcomes of children born to mothers with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. Data were extracted from published reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were pooled with random-effects models and presented as risk ratios or standard mean differences with 95% CIs. This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023395464).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;202 studies, involving 56 082 462 mother–child pairs, were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 110 (54%) examined gestational diabetes, while 80 (40%) investigated pre-gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the total studies reviewed, 169 (84%) exclusively focused on children and adolescents aged up to 18 years. In studies adjusting for at least one key confounder, maternal diabetes was associated with increased risks of all types of neurodevelopmental disorders as well as lower intelligence and psychomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies adjusting for multiple confounders (n=98, 49%), children exposed to maternal diabetes had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental disorder (risk ratio 1·28; 95% CI 1·24–1·31), autism spectrum disorder (1·25; 1·20–1·31), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (1·30; 1·24–1·37), intellectual disability (1·32; 1·18–1·47), specific developmental disorders (1·27; 1·17–1·37), communication disorder (1·20; 1·11–1·28), motor disorder (1·17; 1·10–1·26), and learning disorder (1·16; 1·06–1·26), compared with unexposed children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal pre-gestational diabetes was more strongly associated with the risk of most neurodevelopmental disorders in children than gestational diabetes (risk ratio 1·39; [95% CI 1·34–1·44] &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; 1·18 [1·14–1·23]; subgroup difference p&amp;lt;0·0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal diabetes is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and impaired neurodevelopmental performance in children. Further high-quality research is needed to establish causality and clarify the associations between specific types of diabetes and the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:16:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBiVDFZOVJ3NHlyRHhsdXUyanFhU1Fya0tBUmtzdEJCMFJ5dHU2REJzOFRrb2Y3dzFmYjlHVUNzdVg4aDg1UlBfc0Q5VGN4VzB1RUhwZ2c2VTNQc3U3YnpaQmE0ZHlIY09K</guid></item><item><title>He was a 5th grade dropout.

He remembers &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/16/mental-health-benefits-crying/72613802007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;crying&lt;/a&gt; when he had to leave his mom’s side to go to school and struggling to fit in with other children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The diagnosis came after he spent five weeks in a psychiatric ward as he grappled with severe OCD and phobias after dropping out of school. The educational neglect and social trauma he experienced as an autistic student with OCD, depression and anxiety led him to withdraw from the world for the next 15 years as he took online courses, failing on three separate occasions to reintegrate into public school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I was conditioned to be ashamed and hide who I was,” Lehmann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He felt “completely forgotten by the world,” and he says he’s not an outlier. Today, as a public speaker and UCLA Disability Studies Professor, he focuses on spreading awareness about the intersection of disabilities and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Completely forgotten by the world' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lehmann’s phobias led to extreme isolation in youth, to the point where he rarely left his house. He wanted to join in with others, but there was no support to bridge the gap, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Emotionally and mentally, I’m a living and walking oozing wound,” Lehmann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children with disabilities are more likely to face mental health issues and experience stressful life events – such as abuse, neglect, household instability or exposure to violence, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db431.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Events experienced in childhood can have a long term impact on the transition to adulthood, including employment education and relationships. They are also at a higher risk of experiencing trauma, in part because of factors like discrimination or limited access to resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lehmann experienced long-term effects from his childhood isolation and struggled with a lot of “bitterness and resentment” throughout his 20s as he tried to take part in things like friendships and dating, which he says often led to heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;During a bout of deep depression in 2012, he found solace in Edgar Allen Poe’s writing. He started exploring poetry as a form of self expression, and he published “Inside Out: Stories and Poems From an Autistic Mind” about his journey. In his late 20s, he started public speaking to share his journey, and in a 2022 he gave a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/russell_lehmann_when_ignorance_becomes_awareness?subtitle=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Just existing in that world is traumatic'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lehmann says there’s a “huge misperception” about how disabilities manifest on a day-to-day basis. Teachers commonly misunderstood his methods of self-regulation, such as stimming by flapping his hands, as a threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I was just the square peg trying to fit into that round hole, always forced or berated if I didn't make eye contact with the teachers as if I was being disrespectful,” Lehmann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some autistic individuals may attach themselves to inanimate objects, which can serve as a coping mechanism in overwhelming settings. He recalled it felt like losing his best friend when his teacher took away his toy ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“They thought I was just goofing off, throwing a ball in the air and not wanting to do my work, when that was actually helping me to function,” Lehmann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When educators lack training and knowledge of how disabilities may manifest, it can lead to unnecessarily extreme outcomes, according to Robyn Linscott, the director of education and family policy at The Arc, a non-profit advocacy group for individuals with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If you don't know that this behavior is a manifestation of that child's disability, then you could interpret it in a way that could lead you to escalating the situation, potentially leading you to something that becomes more physical and more dangerous,” Linscott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To this day, meltdowns are an important way that Lehmann regulates his nervous system. A meltdown is a reaction to an overwhelming sensory experience and might manifest in hyperventilating, sweating and crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lehmann has shared footage of those &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIBl1BcxcXS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;meltdowns&lt;/a&gt; to his nearly 44,000 Instagram followers as a way to de-stigmatize the reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the intense scrutiny he faced in the classroom and public settings over time led him to be “unconsciously conditioned to mask all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I liken my life to a play. I can show up and perform quite well, but nobody sees the blood, sweat and tears behind the scenes that go into just simply showing up just so I can function,” Lehmann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/09/USAT/83003997007-img-8120.jpeg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/09/USAT/83003997007-img-8120.jpeg?width=600&amp;amp;height=900&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Murphy King is a 2024 graduate of Harvard University who has autism.

Lehmann says the rise of the social model, which focuses on the social and environmental factors that impact disability and on breaking down roadblocks that “disable” an individual, has been one the largest strides made since he was in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At times, he says being on campus is painfully ironic given how his dreams of attending college never transpired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Seeing the inclusion and accommodations given to autistic students that he lacked for so long is bittersweet — today, a hub of online spaces exists for autistic individuals, and Autistic Pride Day has grown in popularity since it was introduced in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We'd like to think we have come so far, and we have, but the bar was so low to begin with," Lehmann says.
