                Doctors are criticizing a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that questioned the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five pregnant women and new moms in this country &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/#ed3bf220-6f23-44db-893a-1beb9664ba04" target="_blank"&gt;suffers from anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;. And 6-8% of pregnant women are prescribed a group of antidepressants called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cast doubt on the safety of SSRIs — even though these drugs are largely considered safe by healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those comments have sparked a swath of criticism from a number of prominent medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Untreated or undertreated depression during pregnancy carries health risks, such as suicide, preterm birth, preeclampsia, and low birth weight," &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine &lt;/a&gt;wrote in a statement late last month. "Unfortunately, misinformation about depression and its treatment creates confusion and doubt among patients and the public leading to unnecessary barriers to care."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Opening the panel discussion on FDA on July 21, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said that SSRIs have been "implicated" by studies to be involved in a range of health effects, including pulmonary hypertension and cardiac defects in babies. Then a majority of the panelists, including psychiatrists, psychologists and a social work professor, cited studies they said illustrate serious health risks, like miscarriage and autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several groups of healthcare providers, including the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ncrptraining.org/press-release-ncrp-responds-to-fda-panel-on-ssri-use-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank"&gt;National Curriculum for Reproductive Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; have spoken out against many of the claims made by the panel, saying that it misrepresented evidence and spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"As experts in high-risk pregnancies, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and its members are alarmed by the unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims made by FDA panelists concerning maternal depression and the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy," according to &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the statement from SMFM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Robust evidence" illustrates the safety of SSRI use in pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;according to the ACOG statement&lt;/a&gt;, which added that most of these medications "do not increase the risk of birth defects."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Responding to that criticism, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, Andrew Nixon wrote this to NPR in an email: "The claim that the FDA's expert advisory process is one-sided or politically driven is insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scientific 'apples and oranges' &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the studies cited by the panelists as evidence of harm didn't even involve pregnant and postpartum women, says&lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Jennifer-Payne-1689614604" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Jennifer Payne&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive psychiatrist at the University of Virginia and a past president of the &lt;a href="https://marcenortham.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Marcé of North America&lt;/a&gt;, an organization working to prevent and treat mental health conditions during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, British psychiatrist&lt;a href="https://joannamoncrieff.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joanna Moncrieff &lt;/a&gt;referenced a study in youth linking SSRIs to increased suicidality in a "very small proportion of" those taking the medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many of the studies referenced by some panelists have been disproven, notes Payne, like the papers linking SSRI use in pregnancy to cardiac defects in infants. "That has been debunked over and over," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And several studies mentioned on the panel were "poorly controlled," says Payne.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So if you're comparing a pregnant patient who was taking an SSRI, the control group should be the pregnant patient with mental health abnormalities who hasn't taken an SSRI," explains &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/about/leadership-and-governance/leadership-team" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christopher Zahn&lt;/a&gt;, chief of Clinical practice with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or ACOG, who wasn't part of the panel. "And part of the problem with a number of those studies [cited by panelists] is they don't use the right control group. It's really apples and oranges."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And studies that are well-controlled — in other words, those that compare pregnant women on SSRIs with pregnant women with mental health conditions not taking the drugs — do not find the risks highlighted by the FDA panel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The use of SSRIs in pregnancy is extremely well studied," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133369" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nancy Byatt&lt;/a&gt;, a perinatal psychiatrist at the UMass Chan School of Medicine. "We have data on hundreds and thousands of individuals exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That data show that by and large, SSRI's are safe. "What the overall data shows is that antidepressants are not associated with major birth defects," says Byatt. And neither are they associated with a significantly higher risk of miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage, as suggested by some panelists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The impacts of untreated perinatal depression &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One issue that was not discussed enough by the panel, according to Byatt and other experts on perinatal mental health, is the well-documented health impacts of untreated mental health symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Only one panelist, &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/kay-roussos-ross" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross&lt;/a&gt;, OBGYN and perinatal psychiatrist at the University of Florida, spelled out those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When mental health conditions go untreated, these women are less likely to attend their prenatal care appointments and they're more likely to use substances during their pregnancy," said Roussos-Ross. "They are also more likely to face additional risks, such as pre-eclampsia and cesarean delivery." They're also at a higher risk of suicide, she said. Mental health remains&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2814936" target="_blank"&gt; the leading cause of maternal deaths &lt;/a&gt;in the United States, including deaths from suicide.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And there's this huge literature on the effects of postpartum depression, on IQ, language development, behavioral problems" in children, says Payne. "It's as clear as a bell that you want mom to be well, during pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, SSRIs aren't the only treatment option for pregnant and postpartum women, say Payne and others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of tools in our toolbox," says Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For mild depression or anxiety, the first line of treatment is psychotherapy, or talk therapy, she says. "We have evidence-based psychotherapies that we can, should and do use in pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also psychosocial treatments, like peer support, which can be very helpful in improving pregnant women's and new moms' symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding practices like exercise, yoga and meditation to those treatments is also something Byatt recommends to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Often people can't access therapy quickly because of lack of insurance or even if people do have insurance, it's extraordinarily challenging for people to access evidence-based quality therapy," notes Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So for those women, and ones with moderate to severe symptoms, she says, SSRIs are a helpful option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"That may not seem like a lot," says Bethan Davies, a geriatrician at University Hospitals Sussex, in the UK. "But given that there are seven million deaths from strokes a year worldwide, heat may well be contributing to over 10,000 additional stroke deaths per year."

            As Covid-19 transmission ramps up in the United States, recent changes to federal vaccine guidance have left many Americans confused about the latest policies and concerned about access to shots this fall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500043b6nfm6ny2mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US has had a summer surge in Covid-19 case﻿s each year since the pandemic began. This year, however, experts say that the seasonal wave is starting later than anticipated and is relatively subdued. &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=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&amp;amp;selectedChartId=ee1a57" target="_blank"&gt;Surveillance data from WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt; shows that median Covid-19 concentrations ticked up from June to July, with high levels in some parts of the country, but overall, it’s far below this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500053b6njhmb87ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My hypothesis was that the weak winter wave would set the stage for a bigger summer, because many people would not have recent immunity. So far, activity has been more sedate than I anticipated,” epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers wrote in her newsletter Sunday. “I remain open-minded about what August will bring. My best guess is continued increases until early September, but I am uncertain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500063b6nnfv8xtw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although it’s too early to know how big the current uptick will be or how long it will last, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health, says her key concern is whether Covid-19 vaccines will be available “in time to protect people, especially those at high risk, against severe illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500073b6nl61mdai9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My biggest worry at this point is the uncertainty about when updated Covid vaccines will become available and who will be able to get them,” Nuzzo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500083b6n560d0w6b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-covid-19-vaccine-update" target="_blank"&gt;New survey data from KFF&lt;/a&gt; published Friday shows that most adults in the US don’t plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine this fall, but most who do plan to get the shot share concerns that the vaccine won’t be available to them and that their insurance won’t cover the cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500093b6nafnxk26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past few months, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that the Covid-19 shot &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;will no longer be recommended&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and pregnant women, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; a federal vaccine advisory panel and announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/25/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-meeting"&gt;plans to examine&lt;/a&gt; the well-established federal childhood vaccine schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds39om700013b6nwbrlfqjz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the latest survey, KFF polled a nationally representative sample of nearly 1,300 adults between July 8 and 14 – at least two weeks after each of these events.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000a3b6nsic3u84n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a quarter of US adults say Kennedy has made “major” changes to vaccine policy in the US, but another 40% “don’t know enough to say,” the KFF poll found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000b3b6n5eudzqpz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of those who do plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine this fall – more likely to be older adults and Democrats – about two-thirds say they are concerned that it might not be available to them. And more than 60% of insured adults who plan to get the shot are worried that their insurance won’t cover it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000c3b6nn2lwn7rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About half of parents are not sure whether federal health agencies are currently recommending that healthy children receive a Covid-19 vaccine this fall, according to the new KFF data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000d3b6n99riit7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not formally recommend the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children, leaving decisions to be made between parents and their health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000e3b6nlfitmkk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            KFF found that personal doctors or health care providers remain the most trusted source for information about vaccines, with 8 in 10 adults saying they trust their own doctor at least “a fair amount.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000f3b6nwpbtygry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in local health departments and the CDC has been eroding over the past two years, but most adults still say they trust these sources for vaccine information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000g3b6n7jgph5ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far fewer – only 37% of adults – say they trust Kennedy at least “a fair amount” to provide information on vaccines, according to KFF. When asked about the impact of the changes to federal vaccine policy, more than a third of adults said they are making people less safe. Only 1 in 5 said the changes are making people safer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000h3b6nsq48mvy9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rivers says she recommends that people who want their annual Covid-19 get it sooner rather than later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000i3b6nr7i7dlwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The big drawback is, it is not updated yet; the new formulation will be released closer to autumn,” she said, but getting a shot now will offer protection against the unpredictable summer wave and get ahead of access concerns that may arise in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The two are so closely linked, and we know what’s good for one is often good for the other. We were excited to see some of the strongest evidence to date that you can protect your brain health with exercise, healthy eating, social interaction and brain games. A new study looked at people at risk of developing dementia because of a family history or other factors, and found a “recipe” of lifestyle changes helped improve their cognitive function. About 45 percent of all dementia cases might be preventable, according to other research, so this is incredible news for anyone (everyone?) who’s worried about their memory or brain health as they age. And back to that heart-mind connection. Those very same lifestyle changes that are so good for your brain often help your heart. Cardiologist Eric Topol shared 10 science-based ways to protect your ticker — plus there’s an online tool you can use to find out how “old” your heart is! — and I’m sure our minds would benefit, too.

High levels of LDL lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries, which further results in heart disease. Diet plays a crucial role in managing cholesterol. Certain foods can help reduce LDL and increase High-density lipoprotein (HDL), aka, the good cholesterol. Here is a list of foods that will help lower bad cholesterol levels if you take them in the right way. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This can provide about 1 to 2 grams of soluble fiber. Fiber, particularly beta-glucan, helps to reduce the absorption of cholesterol into the bloodstream. You can top your oatmeal with some fruits such as bananas or berries. This can add another half gram of fiber. Soluble fiber can bind cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drag them out of the body before they get into circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective way to lower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-effective-ways-to-lower-bad-cholesterol/articleshow/122887477.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is to replace meat with fatty fish. Meat is high in saturated fats that raise LDL. Fatty fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These can lower triglycerides and protect the heart by reducing the risk of irregular heartbeats. Try incorporating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna (especially albacore), trout, and herring. You can add these fish a couple of times a week to lower bad cholesterol and boost cardiovascular health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Late Dinners Linked to High Cholesterol Levels, Experts Warn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Beans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat your beans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are excellent sources of soluble fiber. These fibers stay longer in your digestive system, which means you will feel full for longer after a meal. Think of adding navy beans, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), black-eyed peas, pinto beans, black beans, and lima beans. Beans are also good for those trying to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go nuts! Nuts are associated with lower rates of heart disease and stroke. One of the reasons is that they lower LDL levels and also improve the quality of LDL particles. You can add almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts to your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054051" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Walnuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, in particular, are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid), which are beneficial for cardiovascular health. Consuming 2 ounces of nuts a day can lower LDL by about 5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Supreme Court Pushes Central Govt to Finalise FOPL: What It Means &amp;amp; Why It Matters? | Explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This compound binds to cholesterol in the digestive system and removes it before it gets absorbed into the bloodstream. Regular consumption of these fruits not only supports heart health but also contributes to overall well-being, as they are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients that the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;In general, all three experts say that avoiding ultra-processed foods and fatty meats (like sausage or bacon) at breakfast is one big way to ensure your morning meal is adding years to your life instead of subtracting them. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538973/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in ultra-processed foods is directly linked to reducing lifespan. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;eating red or processed meat regularly&lt;/a&gt; increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts say minimizing added sugar at breakfast is another way to add years to your life. That means avoiding sugary cereals, flavored yogurts and pastries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a longevity-supporting breakfast, focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods that provide a balance of healthy fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. Incorporate plenty of antioxidants from fruits like berries, healthy fats from nuts, seeds, or avocados and fiber-rich vegetables or whole grains,” Sehgal advised. He also said that including probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or miso, as Bhanote’s breakfast does, can support gut health, which plays a critical role in overall well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes to no surprise that plants reign supreme when it comes to the breakfasts of choice for longevity experts. Consider this a reminder to get your fill of them in the morning. While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming. With hope, you’ll be doing them for many, many years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life_l_67004049e4b0c12c1d3bd133" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, the healthy fats from the avocado or salmon are awesome for your cardiac and cognitive health,” Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307193/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One scientific study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;One scientific study&lt;/a&gt; that took into account more than 18,000 adults found that eating eggs regularly was not only linked to a lower mortality rate, but that it &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; lowered total mortality.

The cashew miso dressing Bhanote drizzles on top provides protein and unsaturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Bhanote opts for coconut yogurt for breakfast, she gets her protein from the yogurt and hemp seeds. “Hemp seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in an optimal ratio, supporting heart health and reducing inflammation,” Bhanote said. She also pointed out that the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953067/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:probiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; in coconut yogurt promote a healthy gut microbiome, which helps reduce inflammation and supports a strong immune system, which are both essential for longevity. The blueberries are high in fiber and antioxidants, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9340979/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help protect against chronic inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;help protect against chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips For Ensuring Your Own Breakfast Adds Years To Your Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Daniel De La Hoz / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, all three experts say that avoiding ultra-processed foods and fatty meats (like sausage or bacon) at breakfast is one big way to ensure your morning meal is adding years to your life instead of subtracting them. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538973/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in ultra-processed foods is directly linked to reducing lifespan. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating red or processed meat regularly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eating red or processed meat regularly&lt;/a&gt; increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All three experts say minimizing added sugar at breakfast is another way to add years to your life. That means avoiding sugary cereals, flavored yogurts and pastries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For a longevity-supporting breakfast, focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods that provide a balance of healthy fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. Incorporate plenty of antioxidants from fruits like berries, healthy fats from nuts, seeds, or avocados and fiber-rich vegetables or whole grains,” Sehgal advised. He also said that including probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or miso, as Bhanote’s breakfast does, can support gut health, which plays a critical role in overall well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It comes to no surprise that plants reign supreme when it comes to the breakfasts of choice for longevity experts. Consider this a reminder to get your fill of them in the morning. While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming. With hope, you’ll be doing them for many, many years to come.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life_l_67004049e4b0c12c1d3bd133" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilylaurence/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life-sc?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPazk5YWQ5NlpCblVydWNFWXdXUGkxNGxIOGxweFlqNTRnS18xRWpURmRoS2l6c2RrZS1jeWYyYU5VUnFaVzJMTXgxdmx1bHF2YXZtb0NnWEpuVWtoXzFPb3Z4dHk0OVEtSFZBVU5sR0h3dGhrMkdJcTVNV1lfNmoxa3EzeUptTlJpeVU4YUtPcw</guid></item><item><title>咖啡因袋：为什么青少年要尝试？ - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9YZ3dEMGRack1Ed2d2WHBnc05LTHZYd29aM0FqOXd4czZBS3cyN0dGUHFMenFYQzRFT0d3UmlncGV1NG9VVXY0XzZxa3dtQm9kR1ZVSEVybnVQd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1sdzU2VWpWSGtJY0NrVGFXdXItMmNJaWNaNm13WkpmcDdBajNCbi1WRWFOM0ZwMXFlUjZXLVNtbFRhMXhCQ21ZVmhnaHlCZ1JpLVJrRk1QTG5jdWc5dHg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Digital health editor, BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A pair of hands holding a can of pouches in one hand and a single pouch in the other.

Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Generally, up to 400mg of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/fsa-and-fss-issue-guidance-on-caffeine-in-food-supplements" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;caffeine a day &lt;/a&gt;appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: "High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Watch for other drinks or food that contain caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr van Dam says it can be easy to overload.

Dogs aren’t like us. You can’t tell them to hold their breath or drink water from a cup backwards. And you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; can’t jump-scare the hiccups out of them (please don’t try). The best thing to do is to help them calm down. Offer a gentle belly rub, some fresh water, distract them with a slow &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-life-lesson-during-daily-stroll-serves-as-an-important-reminder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sniff walk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sniff walk&lt;/a&gt;, or let them relax in their cozy spot.

Either way, the disease hijacks the instructions that tell our cells how to behave, turning helpful teammates into troublemakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, oncology has focused on destroying those unruly cells. A new line of work asks a different question: what if we could push them back to their earlier, well-behaved selves instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift in thinking matters because collateral damage from chemotherapy and radiation can leave patients exhausted, immunocompromised, or facing secondary health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-create-power-waves-to-fuel-invasion/"&gt;malignant cells&lt;/a&gt; into harmless ones – rather than wiping them out – could soften side effects and open doors for people too frail for aggressive regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotting-the-tipping-point"&gt;Spotting the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before a tumor shows up on a scan, genetic and epigenetic tweaks accumulate inside would-be cancer cells. Eventually the balance tips, launching a rapid change known as a critical transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists know a similar tipping point from the way water flashes into steam at 212 °F (100 °C). Biologists, though, have struggled to pin down that instant in living tissue because every cell moves at its own pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KAIST&lt;/a&gt;) recently reported a method that captures this fleeting window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at KAIST, led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho of the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, calls its approach REVERT, short for REVERse Transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to record each cell’s gene activity, reconstruct the internal circuitry, then simulate how the circuitry shifts as cancer sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revert-kills-cancer-with-math"&gt;REVERT kills cancer with math&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many computational &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;cancer models&lt;/a&gt; rely on differential equations packed with hard-to-measure parameters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVERT keeps the math lean by translating gene networks into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/boolean-logic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/a&gt;: every gene is either on or off, yes or no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That stripped-down map is surprisingly powerful. It lets the software explore all the stable states – called attractors – that a cell might occupy and rate each one with a malignancy score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low score reflects orderly growth signals. A high score flags a pattern more typical of tumors, such as constant division or resistance to suicide signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By nudging one switch at a time in the computer, the investigators can ask which combinations shove a high score back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pausing-a-rogue-gene-pair"&gt;Pausing a rogue gene pair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-plant-has-great-potential-to-fight-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;Colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; gave REVERT its first real-world test. The researchers fed the program single-cell RNA-sequencing data from patient biopsies, watched the simulated cells cross the transition, and searched for breakpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One culprit popped up quickly: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MYC&lt;/a&gt;, a gene famous for stepping on the gas in many cancers. Shutting off MYC alone, however, did not restore order. The malignancy score fell partway, then stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second gene, &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=YY1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YY1&lt;/a&gt;, changed the picture. Treating MYC and YY1 as a toggle switch produced two stable outcomes. Tip the balance one way and the cell speeds toward malignancy; tip it the other and normal behavior resurfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have discovered a molecular switch that can revert the fate of cancer cells back to a normal state by capturing the moment of critical transition right before normal cells are changed into an irreversible cancerous state,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-code-to-colon-organoids"&gt;From code to colon organoids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding candidate switches &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; is useful, but genuine tissues decide whether a therapy will fly. The researchers collaborated with &lt;a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seoul National University&lt;/a&gt;, which provided colon organoids grown from patient samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists reduced activity of USP7 – another REVERT-highlighted target – the organoids regained orderly architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells once eager to overgrow instead respected their neighbors’ space and lined up neatly. Those test-tube results hint that similar reversions could emerge in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, this study has revealed in detail, at the genetic network level, what changes occur within cells behind the process of cancer development, which has been considered a mystery until now,” Cho explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that uncovering those hidden levers marks the first time anyone has shown that “an important clue that can revert the fate of tumorigenesis is hidden at this very critical moment of change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-revert-on-different-cancer-types"&gt;Using REVERT on different cancer types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal tumors were the proving ground, yet the underlying logic of critical transitions spans many cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung and breast malignancies, for example, also pass through mixed-identity stages where healthy and diseased programs overlap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because REVERT focuses on that limbo period rather than late-stage chaos, it may reveal intervention points earlier than traditional drug screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_transcriptomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics&lt;/a&gt; keeps improving in depth and speed, so feeding richer datasets into the Boolean engine should sharpen its predictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/crispr-used-to-remove-extra-chromosomes-in-down-syndrome-and-restore-cell-function/"&gt;CRISPR-based&lt;/a&gt; gene editing has grown precise enough to toggle multiple switches in living tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair those tools and oncologists could one day customize reversion cocktails for each patient, sparing healthy organs the collateral hits of broad-spectrum treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancer-revert-and-regenerative-meds"&gt;Cancer, REVERT, and regenerative meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attractor landscape at the heart of REVERT does more than illuminate cancer. Stem-cell biologists routinely coax cells to choose fates during laboratory reprogramming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errant transitions, however, can derail tissue-engineering projects. A map that catches switches before the wrong fork could refine protocols for growing heart muscle, insulin-producing pancreas cells, or even neurons for spinal-cord repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the new framework remains a laboratory concept. Clinical trials that target paired switches must prove safe and durable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumors also mutate quickly, potentially rewiring the very circuits researchers aim to reset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, a strategy that persuades misbehaving cells to stand down – rather than carpet-bombing them – offers a fresh playbook in the long fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202412503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 23:38:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOeWN5TThxY05xaUJMbDR3VlZIblIwSmpwLVBwWEprRkRpRXoyNGhiS216VURYX0NId1NEcjRqaXhXR0xLSmNjS1l5eVAwbkFYMHJqdlZoTmJTS1Jha2NGYmVEeGJHSXl1UDZITnI2a0dSWWZTX0tNWFJGUmdodmlRc0daMF9EZGg5T2M2MjNCalBzMXRPVEo3M3M3MTJENXZXN3g3V3M1ZEZOaG1RcnpULTNvYnZyZw</guid></item><item><title>诅咒的印记？坏死性溃疡代替男性的交叉纹身。- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPSng3TV9SNFI1aTBxZVJ6ZklRUEpIc2ZIc0dJbkRNWTR4eDJJVHJZNzU5UEVxYWxWaUZSUlBPU0l0UVBranRQdkcyWjdPZnpIWFBVcUYtSW14M2ZGTHRPLXIwaWFmUTBRU0lGRnlLelVyRHNWLU5hVTZxc0Z4cHRQLUZkWTJLVFlPYzJZdzhuSEx3YXJ5TDRDYnJadmtVVjV6NXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The doctors used a fine needle to draw out what was in the masses to try to understand what was going on. But all they got out was dead tissue debris and immune cells, which wasn't very helpful. Given the masses, blood clots, and spreading necrotic ulcer, the man was sent to surgery. The doctors surgically removed the ulcer and masses and closed off the clotted veins. They then had to use tissue from the man's thigh to reconstruct his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jinxed ink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final diagnosis was necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, which means that clumps of immune cells formed amid inflammation, his lymph nodes became inflamed and swollen, and there was also dead tissue. It's unclear exactly how it all happened, but the doctors had several hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central theory is that he had an abnormal immune response to the tattoo—red organic dyes and heavy metals that can be found in some tattoo ink have been linked to this before. In one possible scenario, the abnormal immune response led to immune cell clumping, causing his lymph nodes to swell and press against his vasculature. This in turn slowed blood flow in his neck, causing cells to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that chronic inflammation from the tattoo caused the walls of his veins to start eroding, also leading to cell death. A biopsy showed necrosis in his jugular veins that supports this hypothesis. It's also possible that the inflammation response involved a variety of aberrant immune responses that spurred a hyper-coagulant state, meaning his blood formed clots more easily. Blood clots in his neck could have also led to a necrotic lesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors can't say for sure what happened—or if it involved some sort of divine retribution—they say the case expands the possibilities of bad outcomes from tattoos and clinicians should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the man recovered from the ordeal after comprehensive support. He was likely advised to avoid tattoos—and possibly holy water.&lt;/p&gt;

Almost instantly, she got her answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;Dikolas and Reese eyed the new cat with curiosity, then seemingly shrugged and accepted him without much fuss. “It was like he had an immediate stamp of approval to live here,” Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;But something deeper stirred in Tater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="4"&gt;“Tater Swift and [this cat] took one look at each other and fell in love,” Bailey said. “He was immediately enamored with Tater … following him everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-element-type="ParagraphImage" data-element-index="6" class="ParagraphImagestyles__ImageContainer-sc-puj0e1-0 hHKvH page-element paragraph-image "&gt;&lt;picture class="picture-tag picture-tag--lazy" data-testid="picture-tag"&gt;&lt;img class="" src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3197793/768x922/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg" srcset="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3197793/768x922/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg 1000w, https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3197793/1536x1844/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg 2000w" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3197793/768x922/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Caption-sc-1do4sd3-0 kEEwas caption__paragraph-image"&gt;&lt;span class="Credit-sc-ke5nu1-0 jmSitH"&gt;Courtney Bailey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="7"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Bailey and her partner watched as an undeniable bond grew between the cats.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescriptions for weight loss drugs, including Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12979695/ozempic-usage-american-states-weight-loss-drug-rates.html"&gt;surged more than 700 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the US among those who do not have diabetes, and who are prescribed the drug off label, from 21,000 prescriptions in 2019 to about 174,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 1.9million Americans have been prescribed a weight loss drug since 2018, according to data analysis company Truveta, and more than 9.3million prescriptions for the medications have been issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While patients lose several pounds on the injections every month, the weight loss happens so rapidly that they are often left with loose skin as a result of the loss of fat and muscle volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in their 20s and 30s, plastic surgeons said their skin should still be able to bounce back, while sunken cheeks and hollow eyes should recover, but for older adults, they can be left with loose hanging skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the loss, people turn to injectable substances used to restore volume, smooth wrinkles and enhance facial features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They typically last for around three months and cost around $500 to $1,200 per syringe. Fillers are minimally invasive and can be inserted during a single appointment, with patients able to return to normal life the same day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Adam Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, added to this website: 'This has been a trend for a little while, and it is not so much some sort of side effect of Ozempic or Mounjaro or drugs like them, it is really just a normal consequence of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, because so many people have had weight loss made easier by these medications, a lot more people are losing weight, losing weight everywhere and then seeking these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even after you lose 10 or 15lbs, you notice facial changes. Sometimes the amount of weight you lose can show up in your face.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which tracks cosmetic and surgical procedures in the US, found that filler injections have more than doubled between 2017, when Ozempic was first approved, and 2024, the latest date available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally approved for type 2 diabetics, but it has been prescribed off-label by doctors to those who are looking to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its sister medication Wegovy, which uses the same active ingredient semaglutide, was approved in June 2021 for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were around 6.2million filler injections carried out in the latest year, they found, compared to just 2.6million when the weight loss drugs were first approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bruno and Dr Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, said that the 'bulk' of this increase was down to the surge in the use of weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they also said that over this period society has become more accepting of fillers and more people have been open about receiving injections, further raising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ASPS data also showed there had been a 32 percent surge in abdominoplasties, or tummy tucks, over the same period, from 129,000 to 170,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scott Disick shocked the public when he emerged looking gaunt and malnourished in March last year, with images later emerging of weight loss drugs in his refrigerator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a woman who lost 135lbs after using a GLP-1 medication.

It is difficult to treat, with patients often needing regular pain relief and joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a first-in-human trial of a novel therapy suggests doctors could soon relieve the pain for at least a year with a single injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at the Mayo Clinic injected the knees of nine osteoarthritis patients with a genetically-altered benign virus that caused cells to make an anti-inflammation molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 12 months, participants reported they had reduced pain and were better able to move their knee. There were no serious safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christopher Evans, a physical medicine expert who led the study, said: 'This could revolutionize the treatment of osteoarthritis. This study provides a highly promising, novel way to attack the disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was only a Phase 1 trial, the initial stage of testing for a new medical treatment, so more tests are needed to solidify dosage, frequency and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the early results were heralded as promising, with doctors now hoping to be able to get the drug to patients within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nine participants in the early trial had no serious reactions to the treatment (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and is linked to wear and tear on joints caused by aging, repeated stress from a job or sport, obesity or previous injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is most common in the hands, knees, hips and spine, and tends to be diagnosed at around 50 years old. Patients are normally female, and may be overweight or have a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The repetitive stress on joints from overuse and injury can damage cartilage, while aging means cells are less able to repair the tissue, leading to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treat osteoarthritis with over-the-counter painkillers and lifestyle changes, and may also recommend a joint replacement in severe cases. Hyaluronic acid injections are also available, but these normally only last around six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Painkillers and injections only target the pain, while joint replacements are used to resolve the cause of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In osteoarthritis, joints affected by the condition typically contain high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a molecule linked to high levels of inflammation, pain and cartilage loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evans and his team have focused on reducing levels of this molecule by targeting it with the &lt;span&gt;molecule IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which has been shown to reduce IL-1 levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu9804"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists recruited participants who were suffering from osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robbie Williams revealed he was suffering from osteoarthritis in his back in 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were then injected three times in one of the knees with osteoarthritis with an altered virus carrying the IL-1Ra gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene entered cells in the knee, and caused them to start to make the anti-inflammatory molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on blood and fluid found in the cavities of joints after the injection showed there were much lower levels of inflammation than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was only meant to test whether the treatment was safe to use in humans, but doctors said that participants also said the injections helped to ease their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two minor safety events were reported, and both were effusions, or abnormal fluid accumulations, that increased pain but resolved with treatment. The treatment used was not specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how long pain relief from the injections may last. It also wasn't clear whether it could be used to ease pain in other joints like the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evans added: 'Any medications you inject into the affected joint will seep right back out in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As far as I know, gene therapy is the only reasonable way to overcome this pharmacologic barrier, and it's a huge barrier.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In similar early studies, Dr Evans and his team added the IL-1RA gene into a harmless virus called AAV and tested it in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these models, they found that the virus successfully infiltrated the cells that make up the linings of joints and cartilage and caused the molecule to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, the team then received approval to start testing the drug in humans, but regulatory hurdles meant it took another four years before this could begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists are now excited to offer their treatment to a wider group of participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common sedative sometimes taken to get high is becoming deadlier. Research out this week finds that annual U.S. deaths caused by nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or whippits, have significantly spiked over the past decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Mississippi and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign conducted the study, an analysis of mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They found that yearly reported nitrous oxide deaths rose by roughly 500% between 2010 and 2023. Though the death toll from this drug is still low overall, the study indicates that recreational nitrous oxide use is becoming a bigger problem, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “findings underscore a growing public health concern and the need for enhanced surveillance and prevention efforts,” they wrote in the paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836925"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas"&gt;Nitrous oxide gas&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used in medicine as a sedative and anesthetic (perhaps most notably at the dentist’s office). And it’s a common propellant with many uses, including in whipped cream. People also use it recreationally to induce euphoric, if short-lasting, effects. These users often get nitrous oxide from whipped cream canisters, giving rise to the drug’s common nickname of “whippets” or “whippits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10550887.2020.1813361"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that nitrous oxide misuse in the U.S. has increased over time, but according to the authors, there’s still little we know about the deaths that this misuse is causing. Though the effects of nitrous oxide are typically short-lasting, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas#:~:text=Some%20people%20use%20nitrous%20oxide%20recreationally%20to%20achieve%20a%20momentary%20euphoric%20high.%20But%20inhaling%20laughing%20gas%20more%20often%20than%20you%20need%20it%20can%20cause%20serious%20and%20potentially%20life%2Dthreatening%20health%20complications%20like%3A"&gt;misuse&lt;/a&gt; can lead to oxygen deprivation, low blood pressure, seizures, and even heart attacks. Chronic use also saps the body of vitamin B-12, which can cause paralysis and permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined death certificate data sent to the CDC. In 2010, they uncovered 23 reported deaths associated with nitrous oxide poisoning among people between the ages of 15 and 74. By 2023, there were 156 such deaths—a fivefold jump. Annual nitrous oxide deaths continued to increase significantly until 2018 and have since plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf"&gt;National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, at least 13 million Americans have used nitrous oxide recreationally in their lifetime. But the growing popularity of consumer nitrous oxide products has likely driven a surge in recreational use, the researchers say. These products are commonly sold online or in stores as whipped cream chargers or similar culinary products with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/style/galaxy-gas-nitrous-oxide.html"&gt;colorful names&lt;/a&gt; like “Galaxy Gas.” People on social media outlets like TikTok have encouraged the use of these products as part of viral challenges, though TikTok and other platforms have recently taken action to stop these challenges from spreading (at least some teens may still be finding &lt;a href="https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2024/09/28/galaxy-gas--nitrous-oxide--tiktok"&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt; to see the posts, though).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers say that more should be done to educate Americans, especially children, about the dangers of the drug when misused and to mitigate its harm however possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is not local to one area; it’s everywhere,” said study researcher Andrew Yockey, University of Mississippi assistant professor of public health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-07-nitrous-oxide-deaths-spike.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “And it absolutely deserves national surveillance. The numbers are still small right now, but they’re growing, and they’re growing fast.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has also spotted an increase in reported adverse events related to nitrous oxide. In March 2025, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-consumers-not-inhale-nitrous-oxide-products"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a warning to the public to stop using these products recreationally, which it updated in June with more brands to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/embed/vi3271083033/"&gt;Sharks with frickin' lasers&lt;/a&gt; are tired news. Peacocks, apparently, are where it's truly at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous for their dazzling iridescence, peacock feathers are known to &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0043"&gt;contain nanostructures&lt;/a&gt; that scatter light in ways that make their plumage shimmer in hues of blue and green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying a special dye to multiple areas on a peacock's tail, researchers from Florida Polytechnic University and Youngstown State University in the US went on the hunt for structures that may emit a very different signature glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mind-blowing first for the animal kingdom, they discovered the eyespots on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/female-animals-teach-each-other-to-choose-unusual-males-research-suggests"&gt;the fowl's fabulous feathers&lt;/a&gt; have unique properties that align light waves by bouncing them back and forth, effectively turning them into yellow-green lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-emits-a-secret-light-that-scientists-are-trying-to-read?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain Emits a Secret Light That Scientists Are Trying to Read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word laser itself is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Shine a light on atoms in certain materials, such as certain dyes or crystals, and they'll collectively excite one another into releasing a flood of photons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of light amplification &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566119918303963?via%3Dihub"&gt;isn't rare&lt;/a&gt; in nature, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06736"&gt;attracting the attention&lt;/a&gt; of researchers who are interested in developing biological lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become a bona fide laser beam, however, the buildup of stimulated waves must be neatly aligned so their phases march in step. One way to achieve this is to reflect the waves back and forth in a confined space known as an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity"&gt;optical cavity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg" alt="laser coherency diagram" class="wp-image-103608 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What makes a laser's light so different? (ScienceAlert)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found evidence of optical cavities in the form of resonating nanostructures in different parts of the eyespot, all faintly emitting two different wavelengths: green and yellow/orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what kind of structure is responsible for aligning the amplified light at these colors isn't clear. But the fact they are found across the feather, all emitting the same precise wavelengths in a signature fashion, is a sign that something strange is at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the physical properties of these resonators could lead to advances in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-laser-breakthrough-can-read-text-on-a-page-from-a-mile-away"&gt;laser technology&lt;/a&gt;, or provide biologists with a new tool for analyzing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;living materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the peacocks, we can only guess why evolution built lasers into their stunningly iridescent plumage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how biologists are quickly coming to terms with the way &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-shaved-roadkill-to-find-out-how-mammals-glow-in-the-dark"&gt;animals fluoresce&lt;/a&gt; and shine in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-birds-of-paradise-are-secretly-biofluorescent-study-finds"&gt;patterns and colors&lt;/a&gt; beyond our perception, it may be for displays that other peacocks are well adapted to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blue-sharks-may-be-secret-chameleons-scientists-discover"&gt;sharks with lasers&lt;/a&gt; aren't such a terrible idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the same table where I’d sat through both of my pregnancies and where, three years earlier, I’d been diagnosed with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry,” my doctor said. “I know how it feels to go through menopause. Especially since you went through it overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the one who diagnosed me with cancer. I’d found a small lump on my right breast and called her office immediately. Our appointment fell on Halloween 2017, and she was dressed up as Snow White, wearing full face paint and a black wig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are one of the lucky ones,” she said, as I sat on the table and cried. “You don’t need chemotherapy, and you’re going to be okay.” My doctor was right — I was lucky. I’d caught it early, and with breast cancer, early detection is everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My treatment consisted of a mastectomy, reconstruction surgery and 10 years of targeted hormone therapy — to kill the estrogen in my body and lower my risk of recurrent cancer. The goal of these hormone treatments — for pre-menopausal women — is to slingshot you through menopause. It worked. Within a matter of weeks, I went from being a healthy 37-year-old menstruating woman, to a hot-flashing, bone-aching, post-menopausal cancer survivor. I suffered vaginal irritation, something I’d later learn was vaginal atrophy. The only thing not atrophying were my post-operative breasts — they looked perkier than ever. But while my boobs felt 16 again, my vagina felt 61. It was a total mindfuck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It hurts,” I complained. “Just... all the time. And especially during sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause makes it very uncomfortable — nearly impossible — to have successful intercourse,” she said matter-of-factly. “Have you heard of vaginal rejuvenation? A colleague of mine, in Albuquerque, is offering laser treatment in her practice. I think you’d be a great candidate for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author taking a selfie during her first mammogram appointment. "I didn't know at that time what was ahead of me," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later I was home, googling laser vaginal rejuvenation. Eventually, I found a reputable women’s healthcare site with information on the treatment. Above the medical description, there was a photo of a smiling woman in her 60s, wearing a pink button up shirt. She had done the treatments and seemed to be enjoying “successful intercourse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of vaginal rejuvenation treatment I was considering, “gently rejuvenates” the vagina, by delivering a type of therapy known as fractional CO2 (carbon dioxide) laser energy to the soft tissues of the vaginal wall and providing a hormone-free treatment for vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy — for those who have not yet journeyed into the Saharan desert of menopause — is next-level vaginal dryness. It’s a side effect of menopause — practically a guarantee. For many women and people with vaginas, vaginal estrogen creams can provide sufficient relief for the pain experienced during intercourse caused by vaginal atrophy. For women like me — who are proactively killing the estrogen inside their bodies with mega medications — the research remains ongoing about estrogen creams, rings and tablets, and whether they are safe to use. Right now, it’s not something I am comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited to discuss what I’d learned with my husband. In the throes of parenting two toddlers — while also recovering from a life-threatening illness — addressing sexual dysfunction was on our to-do list but hadn’t yet become a crisis in our marriage. Together we defined two major drawbacks to the treatment. The first was the price tag. The laser treatment consists of three sessions, distanced a few months apart. I was quoted $3,000 in total for the three sessions. Insurance does not cover the cost of vaginal rejuvenation, although you might be able to get reimbursed through a flexible spending account (FSA). I don’t have one of those. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second concern was the risk. Most of the websites I researched did not mention any risk involved with the treatment. But there is, of course, risk when you decide to have your vagina lasered. Some women have experienced excruciating pain during the treatment and — in very rare cases — suffered vaginal burns. Despite all that and because I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the treatment and could afford it, I decided to try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, Alex, at the Inn in Vermont where they got married. "This was on our 8th wedding anniversary," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was taking in the desert mesas on my way to Albuquerque for my first laser treatment. When I arrived at the small gynecology practice, I was greeted by a young and chipper receptionist. I told her in a quiet voice that I was there for vaginal rejuvenation. She asked me to repeat myself. I did. She giggled nervously and asked me to wait. I watched her consult with a co-worker before returning to the window. “I’m sorry,” she said with amusement. “I hadn’t heard of that before.” I shot her a look that was meant to say, &lt;em&gt;menopause is coming for you too, young lady. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was led to an examining room and given a gown. A nurse entered the room and applied a numbing cream to my labia. As I waited to go numb, I spotted the laser treatment in the corner of the room. It was a tall machine with a long, slender wand. It looked like something you might see at a dentist’s office. Then the gynecologist walked in — an older, soft-spoken, hippy-ish woman — and told me how excited she was to have the opportunity to perform the treatment. “Have you used the laser before?” I asked nervously. “Only a few times,” she responded. I tried to ignore the sudden wave of panic that washed over me. She turned on the machine and it made a loud, vibrating noise. As I laid back, a tagline from an old Virginia Slims commercial popped into my mind: &lt;em&gt;You’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial treatment went well. For a few days, I experienced some light vaginal bleeding, which was to be expected. The laser creates tiny micro-abrasions on the vaginal wall, increasing blood flow and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels — essentially bringing new life to your vagina. I didn’t feel any pain during the treatment, although it was a bit uncomfortable and awkward. After the first session, I noticed something right away. My vagina seemed happier. In fact, it didn’t hurt ― at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gynecologist told me to have sex in-between the sessions, to help maintain my new elasticity. I was feeling so bolstered from the positive results of the first treatment, I couldn’t wait to jump into bed with my husband. But when it came time to get down to business, I was extremely disappointed to find out penetration remained very painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry,” I said to my husband, after we tried — unsuccessfully — to have sex. “I can’t do this, it hurts too much.” I was in tears. We both were frustrated. &lt;em&gt;Would I ever have sex again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, her husband and two children on Halloween 2017, a few hours after her doctor diagnosed her with breast cancer. "We are trick-or-treating on Canyon Road in Santa Fe, New Mexico," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I brought this question to my next appointment in Albuquerque. My gynecologist told me to wait to finish all three treatments before coming to any conclusions. But the results from the second treatment weren’t all that noteworthy. And the same was true for the third and final treatment. It seemed to me the major benefits of vaginal rejuvenation occurred after the first treatment. It had a very positive effect on the overall wellbeing of my vagina but didn’t fix the painful symptoms I was experiencing during intercourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months after my initial doctor’s visit, I was back in the examining room detailing my experience. My doctor and I agreed that researching and devoting more funds to women’s health has a long way to go. Most women can’t afford expensive vaginal laser treatments, and instead, are learning to normalize their pain or simply avoid talking about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did vaginal rejuvenation fix the painful symptoms I experienced during sex? No. Do I feel comfortable using an estrogen cream? Again, no. But I think of the waiting room at the Dana Farber Cancer Center — and I guess I can live with it. The question is, why should I? Why is there a little blue pill for erections and not an effective medication for vaginal dryness? Yet again, it seems we have been given the shaft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before I left, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Lidocaine, a numbing cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Put this on twenty minutes before sex, it really helps,” she said. Before she left the room she turned and gave me a half smile, as if to say, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcome to menopause, we’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But have we? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few other non-estrogen vaginal atrophy treatments out there — and maybe someday I’ll try them. For now, my partner and I are exploring what “successful intercourse” means to us. Penetration is only one way of having sex — there are lots of fun things to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It surrounds your organs, messes with your metabolism, and quietly raises your risk for things like heart disease, diabetes, and more. It’s called visceral fat, and the kicker is, you don’t have to look overweight to have too much of it. Spot reduction is not really an option, but certaian tweaks in the routine can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, even slim folks can carry dangerous levels of visceral fat — a condition sometimes referred to as “skinny fat.” Unlike the soft layer just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), this kind hides out around your liver, kidneys, intestines, and heart, fueling inflammation and silently working against your health. Visceral fat increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and even Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 workouts to cut down that belly fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you’ve got too much visceral fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visceral fat is about 10% of your body’s total fat mass, that’s normal and healthy, according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Generally, if your waist measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, it may be time to take notice. But don’t cheat the tape, breathe out naturally and wrap it just above your hip bones, right around your belly button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hint is your muscle-to-fat ratio. If you’ve lost muscle and gained fat, especially as you age, that imbalance can mean more visceral fat inside, even if the scale doesn’t budge much. Tools like DEXA scans or smart body composition scales can offer more insight, but the everyday clues, low energy, weight gain around your midsection, or poor sleep, are often just as telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Chappel, on his social media page, recently shared nine habits that can naturally shrink visceral fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid late-night eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating close to bedtime isn’t just about calories, it affects hormones like insulin, cortisol, and glucose, which all play a role in fat storage. Try shifting your biggest meals to earlier in the day and giving your body a few hours of fasting before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the cold&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure, like a quick 1–2 minute cold shower or using an ice pack a few times a week, can activate brown fat, which burns energy to produce heat. It’s not a miracle fix, but it can help reduce waistline over time when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about your workouts. Daily movement that isn’t “exercise”, like walking while on the phone, cleaning the house, or taking the stairs, actually burns a surprising amount of fat. It’s called NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and it adds up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apple cider vinegar before meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a tablespoon of diluted apple cider vinegar about 10 minutes before meals has been shown to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. Stable blood sugar means less fat storage, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep isn’t just rest, it’s a reset button for your hormones. Getting less than 6 hours a night over time is linked to significant increases in visceral fat. Aim for 7 to 9 hours, cut screen time before bed, and sleep in a cool, dark room. Right sleep environment is crucial for a good night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add more soluble fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar, supports gut health, and improves insulin sensitivity, all of which play a part in reducing belly fat. Some good sources: avocados, oats, flaxseeds, and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethink your cooking oils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly processed oils like canola, soybean, and corn oil can fuel inflammation, which plays a big role in fat gain. Instead, reach for olive oil, avocado oil, or even grass-fed butter in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lift weights &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training just two or three times a week can lower visceral fat, even if your weight doesn’t drop. Building muscle improves insulin sensitivity, which helps your body manage fat storage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start your day with protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping protein in the morning is a missed opportunity. A breakfast with 30–40 grams of protein helps reduce hunger later in the day and keeps blood sugar levels steady.

Eight have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection, called Vibrio vulnificus, is one of a dozen species of Vibrio: a bacteria found in coastal waters when the weather is warm and in raw shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday morning that it is seeing a higher number of cases and deaths than typically reported. So far this year, there have been 17 cases and four deaths in the state. Seventy-five percent reported seawater exposure as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;This is a noticeable spike compared to previous years. Between 2013 and 2023, there was an average of &lt;a href="https://lsbme.la.gov/severe-vibrio-vulnificus-infections-in-the-united-states-associated-with-warming-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;13 cases per year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen cases and four deaths have been reported to the Florida Department of Health. The state has been a hot spot for Vibrio vulnificus infections in prior years. In 2022, 74 people were infected and 17 died — "an abnormal increase in cases," the department said at the time. Many were linked to Hurricane Ian, which brought bacteria-laden floodwater into homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Both Mississippi and Alabama have had only one recorded case. Neither were deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1 in 5 people who become infected die, while many survivors undergo limb amputations. Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with open wounds should be cautious when swimming in brackish or warm coastal waters. Some Vibrio vulnificus infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis — a severe bacterial infection that kills the flesh around an open wound, which is why it is called a "flesh-eating" bacteria, health officials said. People with weakened immune systems should also be careful when eating or handling raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966582"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966595"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What’s more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We mostly all have the same genes across species,” Gregg said. “The big change is in the 98% of the genome that does not encode for genes.” Non-coding DNA is largely responsible for gene regulation. In hibernators, specific regions of non-coding DNA act as “master switches” for controlling functional gene responses to starvation and refeeding, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack. To accomplish this, the researchers made whole-genome comparisons across mammals to identify conserved DNA regions that are stable in most species but show accelerated change in hibernators. These hibernator-accelerated regions are regulators that turn genes on in specific cells at specific times, Elliott Ferris, a data analyst in Gregg’s lab at U of U and first author of one of the studies, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand the biological processes that may be linked to these hibernator-accelerated regions, the researchers identified genes that get turned up or turned down during fasting in mice. Hibernation is an adaptation to survive food scarcity, so fasting triggers similar metabolic changes. This led them to “hub genes” that act as master regulators for fasting-induced changes to gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The really surprising discovery that was very exciting was that the hibernation-linked elements are disproportionately affecting those key hub genes,” Gregg explained. “The implication is that hibernators changed the regulation and activity of these core hub genes to have big downstream effects on the whole program for responding to food scarcity and food deprivation. That’s important as we think about translating this knowledge into the real world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gregg is co-founder of Primordial AI, a Utah-based biotech startup that leverages AI to uncover master regulator gene drug targets. Through this company, he aims to develop drugs that mimic the genetic advantages hibernators have, such as boosting neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s patients or reversing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. “Those hub genes are the ones that we think are a really good starting point to design medicines to affect those genes,” Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

However, one family physician sees patients who are often surprised that their weight increased—or at least their efforts to lose it stalled—after they also upped their &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/number-one-healthiest-fruit-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruit intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fruit intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit can satisfy that sweet tooth, hopefully helping you avoid the less healthy refined sugar," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/dr-mike-sevilla-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a family physician. "On the other hand, I have a lot of patients who have incorporated fruit in their diets, but are not achieving weight loss."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's frustrating to follow advice and not see results. However, Dr. Sevilla often asks questions about &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;his patients consume fruit. Their answers frequently reveal they're making a common but sneaky mistake with it. The good news? Fixing it isn't complicated and can be downright delicious. Dr. Sevilla and other doctors share the one thing they're begging people attempting to lose weight to stop doing with fruit, why and what to do instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 &lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/a&gt; 💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The No. 1 Fruit Mistake To Avoid When You're Trying To Lose Weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After talking to patients struggling to lose weight, Dr. Sevilla learns that some of them are using fruit juices. "I prefer my patients to use whole fruit for health benefits," he says. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by Harvard researchers suggested that a tall glass of 100% fruit juice daily could contribute to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habits-of-people-who-never-gain-weight-according-to-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, seeing "100% fruit juice" on a container in the grocery store can seem promising and healthy. Speaking of which, when you look at the front of a fruit juice label, you may see phrases like "Excellent source of &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1142998/shameikarhymes/vitamin-c-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;." That's not just clever marketing—it's true. Doctors aren't denying that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Some of the benefits of fruit, such as vitamins, can still be there in juice form," says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it's important to read the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;nutrition label for fruit juice to see what else is in it (and what's not) that could stifle weight loss efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/weekly-walking-workout-plan-for-weight-loss-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Fruit juices are low in fiber, which does not satisfy hunger, and can cause people to drink more juice and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-blood-sugar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spike their blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spike their blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and insulin levels," explains Dr. Sevilla. "In addition, the amount of calories in fruit juices is higher and more concentrated than in whole fruit."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These risks also apply to recipes one weight loss doctor often sees incorporated into "juice cleanses," which, ironically, can have the opposite effect on your goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"'Juicing' juice cleanses can hinder weight loss because they have too much sugar and not enough fiber to slow absorption of fruit sugar," explains &lt;a href="https://www.drdecotiis.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City.

They may gravitate toward juices with added sugar (and not fiber) instead. Additionally, it's essential to be mindful of whole fruit intake when trying to lose weight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors share these tips to help you eat foods that nourish your body and support your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. Learn to enjoy whole fruit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients constantly ask Dr. Sevilla how to make whole fruit more enjoyable. For instance, there are numerous ways to enjoy fruit without making it the star of the plate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Add fruit to some of your favorite dishes, which helps add a welcoming sweet taste to your meal," he recommends. "[One] example is to toss diced apples or pears into a salad with walnuts and feta. At breakfast, you can try mixing berries into cottage cheese or low-sugar Greek yogurt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. Balance nutrients regardless of your fruit's form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Sevilla's meal suggestions are balanced—for instance, cottage cheese and Greek yogurt have protein, and apples are a good source of fiber. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Decotiis says that's important. In fact, she advises people trying to lose weight to be mindful of how much fruit they consume—even in whole form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit contains important vitamins, minerals and fibers, but also fructose, which is a form of sugar," she points out. "While eating fruit is healthier than eating sucrose found in sweets, it is still sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Therefore, a balance of nutrients is key, with fiber and protein playing vital roles. Without fiber? It doesn't matter if the fruit was in whole or juice form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sugar will be absorbed quickly, resulting in a spike in insulin," Dr. Decotiis notes. "We could see a rapid drop in blood sugar or glucose that could trigger hunger and cravings between meals. Eating fruit with protein or having the fruit with a meal can help avoid swings in blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. Load up on vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Vegetables have less sugar, much more fiber on average and many—if not more—nutrients," Dr. Decotiis explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1316162/michelle-polizzi/high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fiber is filling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fiber is filling&lt;/a&gt;, helps control hunger and boosts gut health while also keeping you regular (pooping)—all of which can help you lose weight at a healthy pace. So, you may not need to load up on fruit if you're consuming lots of vegetables daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If vegetables are consumed in adequate amounts, only one fruit a day is really necessary," she says. "Fruits with higher fiber grams are apples [and] &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-avocados-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;—yes, it’s a fruit, not a veggie."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Ali also notes that consuming fruits on the lower end of the glycemic index can help lower the odds of experiencing blood sugar fluctuations that can make weight loss more challenging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruits like berries and citrus fruits have a lower glycemic index and tend to cause less sugar spikes," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-bananas-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consumption of 100% Fruit Juice and Body Weight in Children and Adults. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-to-do-with-fruit-when-trying-to-lose-weight-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit&lt;/a&gt;

experts say this year is the worst tick &lt;/a&gt;season on record due to a milder winter across the US, which allowed more ticks and their animal hosts to survive the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Maine resident has been hospitalized with the year's first human case of the tick-borne Powassan virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powassan virus human disease cases reported by area of residence from 2004 to 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In line with other tick-borne diseases, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily risen over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to &lt;a href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-6f08b9b0-da13-11ed-b0f8-8f0644773167" target="_self" class=""&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and clearing more land for development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections are increasing across the midwest and northeast and are most common in the summer months when ticks are active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the Powassan virus case in Maine, the CDC is warning residents and visitors to the state to take care in areas ticks might be present to prevent themselves from getting bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powassan virus is named for the city it was discovered in, Powassan, Ontario, where it was discovered in a young boy in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person will often feel symptoms of the virus somewhere between a week and a month after the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Along with other tick-borne disease, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily increasing over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to climate change and clearing more land for development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and generalized weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease can then spread to the brain and cause inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it reaches this stage some of the more severe symptoms include an altered mental status, seizures, speech problems (aphasia, dysarthria), paralysis, and movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Maine resident was reported to have suffered severe neurological symptoms as a result of their infection. They are currently receiving treatment for their infection in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports that a majority of people that are infected with the virus are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency has reported 397 cases of the virus since 2004 and 50 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases have been steadily increasing year over year, with the highest number of patients in 2024 at 57.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the Powassan virus are extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Maine, less than 20 have been reported over the last 12 years, though the prevalence of asymptomatic infections means the figure is likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the most common tick-borne disease is Lyme disease with more than 470,000 new cases but only a small fraction of these cases result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Lyme disease is the most prevalent, there are at least 20 other tick-borne diseases in the US, including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks aren't the only threat, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and dengue fever are also becoming more prevalent due to the rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile virus is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US. Just this week, mosquito samples from two cities in Ohio tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 98 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 53 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the US declared dengue outbreaks in 2024 that have continued into 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local transmission of dengue was reported last year in California, Florida, and Texas. Florida has reported local dengue transmission in 2025 with four confirmed cases of 'locally acquired' dengue found in Brevard County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 2,553 cases of dengue fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They're called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW2eGaUzq7E" target="_blank"&gt;Demodex&lt;/a&gt;, and they feast on the greasy oil (sebum) in your pores! These microscopic 8-legged arachnids are related to ticks and spiders. They don't have an anus or eyes. It's more than likely that you have dozens of them on you at this very minute. They spend most of their time near your hair follicles. They "crawl out to the surface and mate, before crawling back into your pores to lay their eggs." It's impossible to truly rid your body of all of them, so don't waste your time trying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But how old is your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most U.S. adults have a “heart age” that’s older than they are, often by quite a bit, based on wear and tear, heart disease and lifestyle, according to research led by Northwestern Medicine. The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Northwestern University has created a free online tool that calculates how your heart compares to your chronological age and risk for heart disease, using health data like cholesterol levels, smoking status, blood pressure and whether you have diabetes. They make a point, however, of noting it’s not intended to replace doctor visits and that you should use it in consultation with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Calculating-heart-disease-risk" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Calculating heart disease risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Heart disease risk has typically been presented as a percentage, according to a news release from Northwestern. “For example, a health care clinician may tell a patient, ‘eight out of 100 people with your profile may have a heart event in the next 10 years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The calculator is based on the American Heart Association’s prediction tool called PREVENT, which stands for “Predicting Risk of cardiovascular EVENTs.” Updated in 2023 and findings published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191"&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, the tool has been hailed for its “race-free” approach and ability to indicate risk for cardiovascular disease and events, thus hopefully heading both off, per a &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/11/17/predicting-the-risk-of-heart-disease-10-years-younger-than-before/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/11/17/predicting-the-risk-of-heart-disease-10-years-younger-than-before/"&gt;different Northwestern Medicine article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The new calculator doesn’t offer a risk percentage, but rather an age, which could be easier for the average patient to understand, its developers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We hope this tool helps doctors and patients discuss risk for heart disease more effectively so we can better inform what therapies can prevent heart attacks, stroke or heart failure events from ever happening,” senior author &lt;a href="https://www.preventivemedicine.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=25223" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dr. Sadiya Khan&lt;/a&gt;, professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who led development of the PREVENT equations, said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Developing-a-tool" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Developing a tool&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers tested the age calculator on more than 14,000 nationally representative U.S. adults between the ages of 30 and 79. They were all participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2011 and 2020. None of them had a history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Northwestern noted that the women had an average heart age of 55.4 compared to the chronological age of 51.3. The gap was wider for men, who had an average heart age of 56.7 compared to the average chronological age of 49.7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap was bigger based on educational attainment and by race. Men who had graduated from high school or less had a heart age a decade older than their actual age. The hearts of Black men were, on average, 8.5 years older than the actual age. Hispanic men’s hearts were 7.9 years older, Asian men’s hearts were 6.7 years older and white men had hearts that were 6.4 years older than their actual age. All of those are on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among women, the gaps were 6.2 years older for Black women, 4.8 years older for Hispanic women, 3.7 years older for white women and 2.8 years older for Asian women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/30/heart-biological-age-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/30/heart-biological-age-cardiovascular-disease/"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; noted that “the calculator is at the vanguard of '&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/25/longevity-organ-aging-disease/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;organ aging’ tests&lt;/a&gt;, which use a variety of advanced techniques and algorithms to determine whether certain parts of our bodies are aging faster or slower than others. Most of these tests are still in early development. The heart-age calculator is one of the first to be widely available and free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Heart-disease-and-young-adults" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Heart disease and young adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Prevention of heart disease is key, the researchers said, and it should start at young ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The important thing is that we have very good options available in our toolbox to help slow that aging down if we can identify it. This may be even more important in younger people who don’t often think about their risk for heart disease,” Khan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and has been for decades. Khan said that’s because many people who would benefit from prevention tools like medications to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke are not on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Khan said researchers plan to study whether presenting risk with the new calculator bolsters prevention efforts and understanding. They also hope the tool will spark needed conversations about heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Khan told the Post that a year or two difference in actual age and heart age probably doesn’t mean much, but people whose hearts clock in at five or 10 years older should be paying attention and doing something about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology and associate director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, told the Post the calculation leaves out some heart risk factors for women, including menopausal changes and pregnancy complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others point out that exercise and aerobic fitness matter to heart health, too, and are not included in the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2404?guestAccessKey=89b47187-85c1-42da-bfc9-031b4bb0500e&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal that featured the new study, Drs. Mohammad Al Mouslmani, Abdulla Damluji, and Michael Nanna wrote that a calculator could have good or not-so-good effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“While a higher biological age may motivate some individuals to adopt healthier behaviors, others may find such information demoralizing or overwhelming, especially those with fewer resources or competing life demands. Public health messaging and clinician communication should be sensitive to these dynamics, ensuring that risk age is framed not as a verdict, but as an opportunity for change, supported by accessible interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If you check out the &lt;a href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/"&gt;new online heart age tool&lt;/a&gt;, you need to know some basic numbers, like your total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate, which looks at kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNb2x5RGNPcU9Fcl9pMDlwdlNMM3FjZnFZQ3A5MXZPRktNV2VNbGNPTzhZa3d1UmNmSTJQSDFnclpWRFZ3ZmplVm9WcjZBSlluaHVXNFl1R3hQTXp0ZDNRSzNsQ2xHTzhkelk2NHFMdE5HU01PQkxUbWZ3TFduLVplMHFGSUtWNkJWQm50Rks1Q0F0Y0tJalh3RXc2ZHNOVzhLTWxnZDctRkdOVU85</guid></item><item><title>随着减肥药物的蓬勃发展， “Ozempic face”推动了美容手术的激增- Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:39:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdzFyQzQ5Rk1FMk9nNmc4SFNxZDZFV2g5U2ZtZnc2S2xranUteVR2Q3BreG0ySWdZRmhzZktKVXd3MUNDUU4zUldZcEt6QUdiRnItNGMwbmM3d1FfaWVGcGJKWjByaW1hWURreHdEakJ4R2tPX1hTOW5TLWZ0d1lfbmRSU25uekt2c094SHk5SXFpMFdpNDBSSDhhT1VxMTJpMUJTRmdsdDFZSllCZzBrdzdBd9IBuAFBVV95cUxQRVVJRnBVNUVmazlWS3lEWGtSQ0xEMTI5VXU2UmpoQzQ5MUEwcWotTGVSVnE5aGtralJNbmxwNUdiV0pxX1Q1NlMtclZLaEtsbHVSTXpMZzhETmhNelF3YjBwZVZMM1RoSUNsMTNRY1VpbzZwYUE2cUczam1RUjlQQm1DVzBnTjlvblIwcVVYRmJuNzR6RlRaNW5JMERka2R5dUhydXhVUTQtSXdJZHdLU0ptUWdRMEZK</guid></item><item><title>Allina Health关闭了四家诊所，包括明尼阿波利斯Nicollet购物中心的另一笔损失- Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxQdmREVHNwdnBxYUJXNXlWdHlaLUxRRFN5X2w0YnZVOFhsT3lzRWlBN2VTd294MkZ2SEtHYy1Vc2V5UVFJS25hTW9McDJPSE8yRDRLLXFQcUdJaGxqTGxNdzU3WXVENDRTa0ZLdTF3VlNSSWxOZVczM1pzaE82SklSSjdCMFd4VHlFcmhQc1k0Umx3dUhPaXlBMVlUQmFuZS1LZXJ1OHo5dnhsUW5WY043UFVpcldqNW5QYTEzVnFTVlU1b1hpOVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Union officials reacted with alarm as Allina Health announced it would close three suburban medical clinics plus one on Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Minneapolis-based health system said the closures are driven by efficiency concerns, since Allina has underutilized space across its network of more than 60 primary care clinics.

The term first popped up in 2020, and has since taken off on social media, with thousands of users sharing what they “order” when they feel low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s helpful to think of a dopamine menu like a regular menu, Adrienne Matei explained, with “starters” that take little time and effort, more substantial “mains”, and “sides” that zest up the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Matei spoke to several happiness experts about the items on their dopamine menus. These included giving people compliments, sitting in your favorite green space, cuddling with a loved one, and smashing objects to bits in a rage room. Whatever works for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/18/whats-on-your-dopamine-menu-15-ideas-for-a-positivity-boost" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about dopamine menus&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="let-them" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Let them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This year, millions of people realized they can’t control the actions of others – no matter how desperately they might want to. At the end of 2024, podcaster and self-help guru Mel Robbins published a book called The Let Them Theory. Its central thesis was simple: if someone is doing something that bothers you, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;let them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The book made a splash. It jumped to the top of bestseller lists. There were news articles and podcast episodes about the theory, and Oprah called it a “gamechanger”. People even got “Let them” tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The theory was not without critics. Some claimed Robbins cribbed the idea from poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem, Let Them, went viral in 2022. Others said the concept was obvious. But sometimes obvious advice is the most helpful. As one therapist said: “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back, let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to carry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about the ‘let them’ theory&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="creatine" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="ad3f4457-7fc7-44a8-a4ee-c4a5503dfb82" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Gabriel Soler Tomasella/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Strength training has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training#:~:text=Start%20without%20weights,%2C%20pushups%2C%20lunges%20and%20planks." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;darling&lt;/a&gt; of the fitness world recently (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/25/older-women-weightlifting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deservedly&lt;/a&gt; so), and as more people spend time moving heavy weights, there is an increasing demand for products and supplements that help maximize each lift. Enter &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/15/what-is-creatine-benefits-drawbacks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Long a favorite supplement among athletes and fitness professionals, creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities – think sprints or heavy lifts. Synthetic creatine is often sold as a white, flavorless powder that one can mix with water or juice (some influencers take it dry as a stunt, but experts strongly discourage this as it could lead to choking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Creatine is considered safe for most healthy adults.

(Is that the most cursed sentence I’ve ever typed? Who’s to say.) Online, many speculated that her youthful appearance was the result of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/27/what-is-a-deep-plane-facelift" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a deep plane facelift&lt;/a&gt; – a technique that works with deeper layers of tissue than a traditional facelift. Searches for the term soared. (Jenner did not discuss or confirm any particular procedures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Deep plane facelifts are pricey, because it is a more complex procedure, and also tends to last a few more years.

But this comparison is “oversimplified and misleading”, warns Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of a desert shrub, and is the leading ingredient in popular laxatives like Metamucil. When consumed with water, it’s simply a good source of soluble fiber, and has been found to help lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, slow down digestion and increase satiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If psyllium husk isn’t your thing (some people don’t enjoy the gloopy, gel-like texture it develops in water) don’t fear. There are plenty of other good sources of fiber, like fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about psyllium husk&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="fibermaxxing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As protein mania reaches a fever pitch, consumers are already looking toward the next nutrition trend. According to some on social media, the future is all about “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fibermaxxing&lt;/a&gt;” – a trendy term for “eating a lot of fiber”. As one wellness influencer put it, fiber is “super cool”. Indeed, one study found a fiber-rich diet can improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. You could give psyllium husk a try – or just eat an apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about fibermaxxing&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="aa62e5da-f409-47aa-97fa-f4ed9545bc69" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;script src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;","alt":"inline button","index":37,"isTracking":false,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"The Guardian","sourceDomain":"uploads.guim.co.uk"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPelYzM3p2UnJGa01iT2ttbE9wNDdJc2hidnlZcEQxeXhWOFcxYkJYbWNSUE5RVnN0VW5RdTBXSGJFVFJMTU1mVC00Ullac2FVX2JaX0xidHIxUXFib181Q01hQ2FHRVJhaFpEb3ZMdDMxUmJFc1hmZXlaNGFOOG5WTnI2aEJrcWxJOGk2ZFpRaXVDTHItMkZCcF9n</guid></item><item><title>大麻使用者面临明显更高的口腔癌风险，类似于吸烟者- Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaGV3ZzMtc0pSczFYMld2d2kwa1dockxuQjRlTW5nTXQ4SGlJeGhhekliWktTY2lJVkJVQklOV214b0NaeGFTQ0pEbF9Rc3BfcXBaeV9aeHRfV01SWnU3azc0TjkyVjVHUEFoQnM0dktrVDMxeXFxR1ZXZ0pUOGsyc3dvbldDbl9vRkFvRzFYNHg1d2VuZ3RIZXZMOHFtaklaYmw2eHJkeVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More people in the United States now smoke cannabis every day than drink alcohol, with about 17.7 million daily or near daily users recorded in the 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38775461/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift adds urgency to questions about what long term, high frequency use might be doing to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California San Diego (&lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;) followed more than 45,000 patients. They found that people diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CUD&lt;/a&gt;) were 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer within five years than those without the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elevated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-in-any-form-directly-linked-to-significant-risk-of-heart-damage/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; held even after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, and tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/raphael.cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Raphael E. Cuomo, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of the &lt;a href="https://moorescancercenter.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Moores Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, led the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that the findings dovetail with toxicology data showing cannabis smoke carries many of the same chemicals blamed for tobacco related malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-use-linked-to-oral-cancer"&gt;Cannabis use linked to oral cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legalization has widened access to cannabis, yet roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16854249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three-in-ten&lt;/a&gt; regular users meet criteria for the disorder, a clinical diagnosis that signals problematic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike casual &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/legal-access-to-cannabis-is-proving-to-be-good-for-both-people-and-society/"&gt;consumption&lt;/a&gt;, CUD typically involves near daily smoking, deeper inhalation, and higher potency products that bathe oral tissues in combustion by products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; estimates about 59,660 Americans will be told they have cancers of the mouth or throat in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking remains a leading risk factor, but human papillomavirus (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;), heavy drinking, and now cannabis may add new layers to that risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral tumors often begin as painless spots on the lip or tongue, making early detection tricky. By linking CUD and tumor incidence in electronic health records, the &lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt; team offers clinicians a fresh flag for vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-raises-cancer-risk"&gt;Cannabis raises cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study drew data from six academic medical centers between 2012 and 2019, then tracked each participant for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 2.1 percent developed CUD, yet that small group accounted for nearly a third of the oral cancer diagnoses observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;Tobacco smokers&lt;/a&gt; in the cohort already faced extra danger, but those who both smoked cigarettes and had CUD were six times more likely to be diagnosed than smokers without CUD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cannabis signal persisted inside the smoking subgroup, Cuomo’s team suspects mechanisms beyond simple smoke exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that women, older age, and higher body mass index appeared to slightly temper risk, echoing patterns seen with tobacco related oral cancers. However, those demographic buffers did not erase the impact of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoke-harms-mouth-tissue"&gt;Smoke harms mouth tissue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18062674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; show that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-03/documents/pahs_factsheet_cdc_2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAHs&lt;/a&gt;), benzene, and ammonia, many at concentrations equal to or higher than tobacco sidestream smoke. Several of these compounds directly damage DNA in epithelial cells lining the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed chemical fingerprint published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63120-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; cataloged 2,575 distinct compounds in mainstream cannabis smoke, 110 of which are known human toxicants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such particle rich aerosols stick to mucosal surfaces, extending contact time between carcinogens and target cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histology from habitual marijuana smokers has revealed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9719080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dysplasia&lt;/a&gt; and other precancerous changes in bronchial tissue even when tobacco is absent. Those cellular alterations mirror the earliest steps seen on the path to malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-affects-cancer-defense"&gt;Cannabis affects cancer defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetrahydrocannabinol (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;), the main psychoactive molecule in cannabis, can impair &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18040791/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune suppression&lt;/a&gt; pathways that normally patrol for rogue cells. Less immune surveillance could give mutated oral cells a head start toward tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible or vaporized products bypass the oral cavity, yet frequent users often combine delivery methods, so risk patterns for noncombustible forms remain unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies that separate smoke exposure from total THC dose may untangle these variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether the rising average potency of commercial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-potency-why-you-shouldnt-trust-the-label/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; accelerates carcinogen uptake or immune effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public laboratories have only begun to simulate how today’s 25 percent THC flower compares with the 4 percent material studied decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-users-face-big-risk"&gt;Daily users face big risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD commonly face co-occurring mental health challenges, alcohol misuse, and lower participation in preventive dental care. These overlapping factors could compound cancer risk and delay diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic gaps may also play a role, because uninsured adults are less likely to receive routine oral examinations. Community clinics that integrate substance use counseling with oral screenings could bridge that divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, the takeaway is straightforward. When a patient meets criteria for CUD, adding a quick inspection of the mouth and a referral to dentistry costs little but may spot trouble early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heavy-cannabis-harms-oral-health"&gt;Heavy cannabis harms oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is not just a milder cousin of tobacco, its smoke delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;complex chemical load&lt;/a&gt; with measurable impacts on human tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC San Diego study reminds us that heavy, prolonged use carries consequences that legalization debates often overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers weighing retail expansion should ensure that cancer prevention messaging keeps pace with marketing. Clear warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs, could help users make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, anyone lighting up daily can lower potential harm by switching to noncombustible products, spacing out sessions, and keeping regular dental check ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will continue probing dose, delivery, and biology, but prudence starts with individual habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth,” noted Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying aware of that simple fact may be the first step toward safer choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preventive Medicine Report&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-0b46afe3-5373-4d7b-b149-ae51b4185ee8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-94c7e0c5-6e44-4b60-b48d-91c9796c24f4"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-443f8909-7106-405a-b093-e9b4bd7024ee"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-4454416d-6e1a-4eaf-b811-4a941bc234b2"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:14:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaGV3ZzMtc0pSczFYMld2d2kwa1dockxuQjRlTW5nTXQ4SGlJeGhhekliWktTY2lJVkJVQklOV214b0NaeGFTQ0pEbF9Rc3BfcXBaeV9aeHRfV01SWnU3azc0TjkyVjVHUEFoQnM0dktrVDMxeXFxR1ZXZ0pUOGsyc3dvbldDbl9vRkFvRzFYNHg1d2VuZ3RIZXZMOHFtaklaYmw2eHJkeVI</guid></item><item><title>致命的食肉细菌在路易斯安那州杀死4人- WAFB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcHVJNWQxaEpWV3N4M19pZDNKRV9RUU9LTUpyNHM0bWN2V01yZUY2b2MwWEhhM0pMQ2dReWV6aU5NanZGVzJpbFl1eHFtUmctUWtSYXJRZHFZZ2dEOFk0NUJ1TktRQ2pPLUUzUERhXzhnVk4xc0ozZXM3anl3YVlmajYydjRCQdIBmgFBVV95cUxPcmxxVWRZREc2ZjFSdHZwWHNPeG5kS1NSRHI3NWFrQVhVc3VxSFVwT3NRSWQ4UXZJWHQxWUZmUFFWUGpTWHVYOW9VbWtxYnlLMkZITE5rYkhhbUd5azAwSnA4UERXbllxYVUyZWY5a1ROQm1xUFZNem1vamZMX3pSRDBDdW1ORDJLUUtlaUcyNGlIbl92Y3Ryci1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Louisiana health officials are warning residents to take precautions after a rise in cases of Vibrio vulnificus, a potentially deadly, flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters and raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;So far in 2025, the Louisiana Department of Health has confirmed 17 Vibrio vulnificus infections statewide. All required hospitalization, and four people have died. Over the past decade, the state reportedly averaged only seven cases and one death annually during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to coastal waters or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The LDH says 75% of this year’s infections have been linked to open wounds exposed to seawater. Vibrio bacteria thrive in warmer months, typically May through October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In Florida, thirteen people have contracted Vibrio vulnificus and four have died from it so far in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html"&gt;Florida Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;State health officials warned that you don’t have to be swimming to be at risk. Even handling raw seafood with a small cut can cause a severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who’s most at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While anyone can become infected, individuals with chronic health conditions such as liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or those who are immunocompromised, face a much higher risk of severe illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some infections result in gastrointestinal symptoms like watery diarrhea, cramps, nausea, fever, and chills. Others cause wound or bloodstream infections that may lead to blistering skin lesions, amputation or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to the CDC, about 1 in 5 people with Vibrio vulnificus die, sometimes within 48 hours of becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stay safe:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid brackish or saltwater with open wounds or cover wounds with waterproof bandages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoroughly clean any cuts that may have been exposed to water or raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wear protective gloves when handling raw shellfish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t eat raw or undercooked oysters or seafood, especially if you’re in a high-risk group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wash your hands with soap after handling raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Additional resources and prevention tips are available on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;CDC’s Vibrio page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:typo@wafb.com" target="_self" rel="" title="mailto:typo@wafb.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to report a typo.

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine may help some bacteria keep antibiotics out of their cells, potentially reducing the therapeutic effects of the drugs, a new laboratory study hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts caution that it's not yet clear how this effect might play out in humans, so caffeine drinkers needn't panic yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known for decades that bacteria can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1429469790730861249&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41579-018-0048-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fcaffeine-may-help-e-coli-resist-antibiotics-but-more-research-is-needed" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-018-0048-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41579-018-0048-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fcaffeine-may-help-e-coli-resist-antibiotics-but-more-research-is-needed" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protect themselves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by pumping out harmful substances through special transport proteins in their outer layers — and this ability helps bacteria resist the effects of drugs that would otherwise kill them. However, it wasn't clear how bacteria change the activity of the genes behind these transport proteins in response to molecules they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, researchers tested how the common gut bacterium &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; — better known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— responded to 94 different chemical compounds, including antibiotics and aspirin, as well as products made in the gut, like secondary bile acids. They also looked at small molecules found in common foods, such as vanillin, the compound that gives vanilla its flavor, and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study, published July 22 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed that many different chemicals can trigger changes in bacterial transport-related genes and thus potentially affect their response to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/superbugs-are-on-the-rise-how-can-we-prevent-antibiotics-from-becoming-obsolete" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/superbugs-are-on-the-rise-how-can-we-prevent-antibiotics-from-becoming-obsolete"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superbugs are on the rise. How can we prevent antibiotics from becoming obsolete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, caffeine was found to reduce the production of a transport protein called OmpF, which helps bring common antibiotics — like ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin — into bacterial cells' membranes or innards. In theory, with fewer of these OmpF proteins available, the antibiotics cannot access their targets within the cells as easily, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this finding shouldn't worry coffee drinkers just yet — there are many potential variables that haven't been studied yet, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecehh.org/person/april-hayes/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ecehh.org/person/april-hayes/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;April Hayes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the study. "This would include whether the effect of caffeine would reduce the body's ability to clear infections," Hayes told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.edwards" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.edwards" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andrew Edwards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of molecular microbiology at Imperial College London, agreed that "there's no evidence from this study that drinking coffee will affect a person's response to antibiotics and nobody should change their routine." Edwards, who was not involved in the study, said he recommends that people prescribed antibiotics follow their doctor's guidance and the instructions that come with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="adaptable-microbes-3"&gt;Adaptable microbes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany looked at how seven genes involved in transport inside &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; responded to different chemicals. Out of the 94 substances they tested, 28 changed the activity of these genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemicals that had an effect included caffeine; the weed killer paraquat; and certain classes of antibiotics, like tetracyclines and macrolides. Drugs that block folic acid, which are used to treat some cancers and inflammatory diseases, and salicylates, a broad class of drugs that includes aspirin, also had an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study adds to a growing appreciation that bacteria can sense and respond to numerous different stimuli … all of which can affect the susceptibility of the microbe to antibiotics," Edwards said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-third of the chemical-induced genetic changes involved the Right-origin-binding protein ("Rob," for short), which switches genes on or off by binding to specific DNA sequences. The findings suggest that Rob plays a bigger role in helping &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; adapt to its environment than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, it's still unclear exactly how caffeine changes gene activity in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; or interacts with Rob at the molecular level. Additionally, the researchers don't yet know whether the effects seen in lab experiments happen the same way during real infections in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers found that caffeine's ability to interfere with how antibiotics work also applied to a strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; sampled from a real patient with a urinary tract infection. This lab experiment suggests the effect of caffeine on bacteria could have important implications for human health — but again, that will need to be confirmed in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could also look at microbes beyond &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers suspect their findings may also have implications for how other bacteria tweak their transporters over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But importantly, "at this point, it still seems highly unlikely that consuming caffeine would result in a difficult-to-treat infection," Hayes said. "Overall, this study is interesting, but is not a cause for concern for caffeine consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk-8g6TlsOeaIzsfPf6gMeYd2hDsoIzIdTD" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk-8g6TlsOeaIzsfPf6gMeYd2hDsoIzIdTD slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or dietary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How’s the weather inside your head? If it’s foggy, you are not alone. You may have what people with a variety of health conditions call brain fog — a common term for thinking problems that can make getting through the day a mental slog.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;While there’s no official list of symptoms, people with brain fog often say that “their thinking is not clear, it’s cloudy,” says Lynne Shinto, a naturopathic doctor and professor of neurology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University. “They might say, ‘I have problems concentrating.… I feel like I don’t have clarity of thought, and sometimes I forget things.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-dementia/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia"&gt;people with dementia&lt;/a&gt; or other, more severe cognitive challenges, they often can do what they need to do in a day, but “their thought processes are just slower,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychologist Julie Dumas, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, says brain fog can be like “thinking through mud or molasses.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Brain fog is not a disease or disorder itself, so it’s important to figure out the underlying cause, Dumas says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;A recent research review published in &lt;i&gt;Trends in Neurosciences&lt;/i&gt; found that brain fog has been linked with more than a &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/most-common-chronic-health-conditions/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="chronic health conditions"&gt;dozen chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and exact symptoms and cognitive test results can vary, depending on the apparent cause. That suggests that there’s no one underlying pathway, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most common possible causes of brain fog:&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sleep problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Not getting &lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/better-sleep-for-better-health/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="better sleep"&gt;enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; is a major cause of brain fog. If you have chronic insomnia, which can include problems falling or staying asleep, improving your sleep can clear the fog, says Leslie Swanson, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Another sleep disorder strongly tied to daytime sleepiness and foggy thinking is &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/sleep-apnea-treatment-benefits/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="sleep apnea"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a disorder in which people stop breathing repeatedly during sleep. Many people go undiagnosed and untreated for this condition, Swanson says. “&lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/causes-of-snoring/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="snoring"&gt;Snoring is a red alert&lt;/a&gt;” and a good reason to see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Perimenopause&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Women going through the hormonal shifts of perimenopause, the years before periods end, often report brain fog, with problems like forgetting names or having &lt;a href="/work/careers/talking-to-boss-about-menopause/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="menopause and work"&gt;trouble focusing at work&lt;/a&gt;, Swanson says. Studies back them up, she says, finding “small declines” in learning and verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation is that perimenopause often comes with sleep disturbances, especially unwanted awakenings during the night, Swanson says. &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/common-menopause-symptoms-treatments/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="menopause symptoms"&gt;Hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; cause some, but not all, of those disturbances, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Hormonal shifts may affect sleep and brain functioning even in women who don’t have a lot of hot flashes, she says. The good news, she says, is that the fog tends to lift after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. COVID-19 and other infections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;When you get &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/covid-flu-or-cold-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="flu covid or rsv"&gt;the flu, COVID-19 or any infection&lt;/a&gt;, especially with a fever, you can get brain fog, which is likely linked to inflammation, Dumas says. But one reason more people are hearing about brain fog these days is that it’s a common part of &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/long-covid-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="long covid"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, the symptoms that continue or develop after the initial illness, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Shinto says she has seen some long COVID patients with “intense brain fog, where they have a lot of trouble concentrating [and] intense mental tasks are very draining.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In addition, many are constantly physically exhausted. That combination, along with other symptoms, can be disabling, making it impossible for some people to manage their usual daily activities, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

The water soluble vitamin, explains Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital, plays a vital role in nerve function, blood cell formation, metabolism, DNA production, and many other functions that our bodies need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; foods are easy to add to any routine. Whether you're solely following a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/delciously-ella-mills-healthy-plant-based-eating-guide-farmers-market-recipes-ingredients" target="_blank"&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt; or welcome any animal and dairy product into your meals, you can find vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; foods pretty much in any food group. And as an added bonus, these foods also come with other essential nutrients (think omega-3 fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, iron, and more) that our bodies need. So if you’re looking to see if you’re already on the right track or wanting to add more good sources of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into your life, the best ones to add are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love shellfish, registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt; says that clams make for a great source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 3 oz. of clams contain about &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;17 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient. It also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157509000234" target="_blank"&gt;contains iron&lt;/a&gt;, which she says makes it a great combo with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; for energy and red blood cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef, Chicken, and Other Animal Liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker calls liver a nutrient powerhouse as it contains B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/retinol-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;. According to the NIH, one serving of beef or chicken liver contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;70.7 micrograms (mcg)&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is almost &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;3000% daily value&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day" target="_blank"&gt;favorite food&lt;/a&gt; amongst experts and our favorite celebs. Manaker says it’s not only high in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.6 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient, but it is also a main source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. This combo especially helps support brain function and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker lists trout as another fish source that is rich in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and omega-3s. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), one filet of trout has &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172004/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;4.6 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tuna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuna is known as a great source of protein, but Manaker says you can also look to the fish for your B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; needs. The NIH says that 3 ounces of tuna contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.5 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great source of protein and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, Manaker says eggs are &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/2-eggs-for-breakfast-for-2-weeks" target="_blank"&gt;one of the easiest foods&lt;/a&gt; to add to any meals. The NIH says one large egg contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;0.5 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dairy Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole milk (please don’t drink raw milk), is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/healthiest-milk" target="_blank"&gt;nutrient powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;. It’s most known as a great source of calcium to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. But it also provides protein, vitamin D, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrate, repair muscle, and boost our energy and metabolism. The NIH says that one cup of 2% milk contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;1.3 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dairy product you can turn to for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is yogurt. The NIH says that 6 oz. of plain, fat-free yogurt contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;1 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sardines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned fish are &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/are-tinned-fish-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;having a moment,&lt;/a&gt; and sardines especially make for a great source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. “Tiny but mighty, they’re rich in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, calcium, and omega-3s,” says Manaker. According to the USDA, one tin of sardines contains &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175139/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;8.22 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lean Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean beef provides you with many different nutrients, such as protein and iron. Manaker also lists it as a good source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to give you energy and boost red blood cell health. The NIH says that 3 oz. of lean beef contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.4 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional Yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its cheese-like flavor, nutritional yeast is a vegan seasoning that is packed with nutrients. It’s especially rich in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, according to the NIH. A quarter of a cup can contain anywhere from &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;8.3 to 24 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; do for the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;benefits of vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt; are many. Manaker says that it primarily helps convert the food you eat into energy for your body. But it also supports your nervous system, produces red blood cells, and DNA production while also reducing your risk for heart disease. And if you’re feeling the need for an emotional boost, she says the nutrient can play a role in regulating your emotions and producing serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; should I take daily?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieras says that the recommended amount of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; one should aim for can range from 2.4 to 2.8 mcg per day. For those who are pregnant, Manaker says it’s best to stick to 2.6 mcg per day while those who are breastfeeding may increase it a bit to 2.8 mcg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should I take vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker says that eating whole foods in a well-balanced diet is the ideal way to get your daily vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; intake. But if you’re not getting enough from food or if you have absorption issues (a.k.a pernicious anemia), you might need to incorporate dietary supplements into your routine. she says you can turn to supplements in a pill form or as a shot if prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there downsides to vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Dieras and Manaker say that vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is generally safe and that there are minimal downsides. “B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements are generally safe because your body flushes what it doesn’t need,” Manaker says. In high doses, it may cause headaches or nausea. Dieras says it might also interact with certain medications such as gastric acid inhibitors and metformin. As with any new supplement you’re interested in taking, it’s always best to consult with a doctor to make sure it’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about?

                                &lt;p&gt;WYOMISSING, Pa. - The Animal Rescue League of Berks County (ARL) is issuing a warning to residents of the Wyomissing area after an injured cat tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ARL received results for a positive rabies case after an injured brown tabby and white kitten were located by a resident near Hill Avenue in Wyomissing Borough on Saturday, July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyomissing Borough, the ARL and the Pennsylvania Department of Health are assessing the exposure to all individuals involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a precaution, residents should be alert for other animals in the area with signs of illness and should not allow their pets outside unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone that suspects they have been in contact with an animal infected with rabies is advised to seek immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that an animal is infected with rabies, please contact the animal control provider of your municipality or your local police department and do not approach the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of rabies in animals include general sickness, swallowing problems, excessive drool or saliva, an animal who bites at everything, an animal who appears tamer than you would expect, an animal who is having trouble moving or may be paralyzed, or a bat that is on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, rabies is a neurological virus that infects the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death in 99.9% of human cases if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say making sure pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keeping them away from unfamiliar animals, especially wildlife, is the most effective way to keep pets safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A potential new male contraceptive drug has just undergone its first tests in human volunteers. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01004-4"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; give the first indication that the drug, which does not use artificial hormones or affect testosterone production by the testes, may be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous attempts have been made to develop a male contraceptive in the past, these largely failed to pass  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; due to their unacceptable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this newest contraceptive works differently from past attempts, which means it doesn't require surgery and is much less likely to cause hormonal side effects – problems that have helped stop previous attempts from reaching the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed the drug was well tolerated in a small group of healthy young men and did not appear to cause any serious side effects at the doses used. Further research will be needed to demonstrate precisely how effective it is as a contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-type-of-reversible-male-contraception-proves-a-success-in-mouse-study?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Type of Reversible Male Contraception Proves a Success in Mouse Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new method uses a specially designed chemical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782424005237"&gt;known as YCT-529&lt;/a&gt; to target a specific cell receptor in the testes called retinoic acid receptor–alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar, but less specific compounds, had been shown to reduce sperm production in humans previously. But these compounds also had unwanted side effects – such as feeling ill when &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2164/jandrol.110.010751"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, altering salt levels in the bloodstream and &lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(02)00294-9/abstract"&gt;not being fully reversible&lt;/a&gt; in all men. This made them unsuitable for contraceptive use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg" alt="man taking pill" class="wp-image-169661 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Previous attempts at a male contraceptive pill have proven unsuitable. (Ron Lach/Pexels/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00752-7"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, YCT-529 was shown to produce fully reversible, temporary infertility without any significant side effects. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/157/4/1601/2422643?login=true"&gt;study in mice&lt;/a&gt; also found that those who went on to father babies after stopping the drug produce normal, healthy offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the drug then entered into phase 1 trials in humans. This is the first stage of human testing, where a small group of healthy volunteers are recruited to test safety, tolerability, and possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small trial involved 16 male volunteers who took the drug twice at increasing doses – either 10mg to 30mg or 90mg to 180mg. Some men took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; pills for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were monitored for 15 days for any effects on normal hormone levels, inflammation (signs of cell damage), kidney and liver function, abnormal heart rhythms, sexual desire and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No changes were detected in the natural hormones in the body. There were also no lasting effects on liver and kidney function and no signs of cell damage. No dangerous abnormalities of heart rhythm were detected, and the participants reported no changes in mood or sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, participants only took two doses of the drug and were only followed up for 15 days. The authors say in the paper that a larger phase 2 trial is underway which will test the drug in a greater number of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will then be followed by phase 3 trials in hundreds of men where the effectiveness, reversibility and side effects of longer term use of the drug will be assessed. These are the hurdles which have prevented other approaches from being made widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why past male contraceptives have failed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present there are no commercially available contraceptive methods for men that are not only safe and effective at preventing pregnancy, but which also allow sperm production to be turned off and on again at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While condoms have few side effects and are used at will, they have a relatively &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/psrh.12017"&gt;high failure rate&lt;/a&gt; (resulting in pregnancy around 12%-18% of the time with typical use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vasectomy, which severs the tube connecting the sperm-producing testes to the rest of the male reproductive organs, is very effective (more than 99%) and safe – but it's not easily reversible and requires a minor operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg" alt="vasectomy diagram" class="wp-image-169659 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of a vasectomy. (Anna Bergbauer/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts (and some ongoing) at producing a reversible method of contraception for men. Some have proven to be effective at stopping sperm production or preventing sperm from exiting the male reproductive tract. However, they haven't moved to the stage of commercial production, often because of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these attempts used one of two main approaches to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-020-0099-1"&gt;One method&lt;/a&gt; involves injecting a substance into the vas deferens (a tube leading from the testes to the urethra). This substance filters out and damages sperm during ejaculation. This substance can be flushed out through a minor procedure if the man wishes to become fertile again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback of this method is that it requires a minor surgical procedure (an injection into the scrotum) and that the man has to have a further procedure to reverse its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second route involves stopping sperm production altogether by lowering the hormones that cause sperm to be made in the testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most successful of these trials used &lt;a href="https://srh.bmj.com/content/45/4/236"&gt;an injectable progestogen&lt;/a&gt; (a synthetic version of the sex hormone progesterone). This injectable signalled the brain to stop producing follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) and lutenising hormone (LH), which normally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8658012/#:%7E:text=These%20two%20hormones%20are%20composed,genitalia%20the%20maintenance%20of%20spermatogenesis"&gt;signal the testes&lt;/a&gt; to produce sperm and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, suppressing LH also turned off the testosterone in the testes that is needed for normal, healthy function in men. To counteract the loss of testosterone, this contraceptive approach required men to take an "add back" testosterone – either as a tablet or a gel applied to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110729-male-contraceptive-injection-works-but-side-effects-halt-trial/"&gt;major trial&lt;/a&gt; testing this method was stopped early because of the hormonal side effects participants experienced, including mood swings, acne and changes to sex drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go before the new drug can be considered suitable for use as a male contraceptive. But this new approach shows a lot of promise because it avoids upsetting hormonal balance and can be taken orally – rather than requiring an invasive procedure. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262083/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Five ZIP codes have been affected — 10027, 10030,10035, 10037 and 10039 — which generally stretch across Harlem from 116th to 155th streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="60ld3"&gt;City health officials declined to provide specific information on the person who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ibgl"&gt;“Anyone with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible," Dr. Toni Eyssallenne, deputy chief medical officer at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="arr1e"&gt;“Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early," she added. "But New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older, those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="27e8t"&gt;Health officials said cooling towers on buildings in the outbreak area had been tested for legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease, which can lead to severe pneumonia. The bacteria grows in warm water and can sicken people who inhale infected water vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dkn87"&gt;The health department said it ordered building owners with affected cooling towers to remediate them within 24 hours and report back to the agency. Legionnaires’ disease can be treated with antibiotics, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a908s"&gt;Symptoms usually show up within two to 14 days of exposure and include cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, shortness of breath, diarrhea, confusion and nausea.

They may age your body faster too. In 2023 alone, the city recorded over 140 days with temperatures surpassing 100°F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research suggests that these extreme heat conditions do more than cause short-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; has revealed that long-term exposure to high heat can speed up biological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/monthly-exercise-before-the-age-of-50-results-slows-brain-aging-dramatically/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people in places like Phoenix show signs of accelerated aging at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-ages-you-like-smoking"&gt;Heat ages you like smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impact is similar to the effect of smoking and drinking,” said Eunyoung Choi, lead author and gerontologist at the &lt;a href="https://usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi’s team compared older adults from across the U.S., including heat-struck Phoenix and cooler cities like Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in hotter areas appeared around 14 months older biologically than their cooler-region counterparts. These results reflect how consistent heat exposure may silently wear down the body’s internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-affects-health-and-work"&gt;Aging affects health and work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt; gerontologist Deborah Carr noted that even small differences in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; matter. “It’s just a tremendous strain not only on their own lives and the lives of their families and caregivers, but also has a larger societal impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster aging may lead to earlier onset of conditions like diabetes, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those health issues appear sooner, they may push people out of the workforce or into expensive, long-term care. “It really can have tremendous impacts,” said Carr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-changes-how-your-genes-work"&gt;Heat changes how your genes work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on biological age, not just chronological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-are-experimenting-with-new-approach-to-fight-and-stop-human-aging-necrosis/"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;. They used DNA samples to track changes linked to a process called methylation. This chemical process affects how genes behave. It acts like switches that can turn genes on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylation doesn’t alter the DNA sequence but changes how genes are expressed. These shifts can occur in response to environmental stress, poor diet, inactivity, pollution, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used several epigenetic clocks to measure aging. These clocks rely on different sets of DNA methylation markers and offer insight into both pace and risk of biological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-makes-aging-speed-up"&gt;Heat makes aging speed up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased heat exposure was linked to faster aging in several clocks. Short-term exposure, such as a few days or weeks, raised PCPhenoAge, a measure tied to general physiological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term exposure, such as one to six years, also accelerated PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE, which reflect mortality risk and pace of decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support this. Heat stress can leave a lasting “epigenetic memory” that alters how immune cells and heart cells function. These changes persist long after the initial heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, heat has been linked with reduced methylation of genes like TLR-2. This gene affects inflammation and immunity. Such changes may explain how heat accelerates disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rising-heat-makes-things-worse"&gt;Rising heat makes things worse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency visits and deaths spike during heat waves. With climate change, those risks only grow. The U.S. may see 20 to 30 more extreme heat days each year by mid-century, according to the National Climate Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi warned that this rising heat comes as the population ages. Older people cannot cool themselves as efficiently. Medications and declining circulation increase their vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But heat affects everyone. “It’s basically like if you’re trying to tread water and someone hands you a brick,” said Robert Meade, a heat physiology expert from &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s just an extra weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-levels-at-home-matter"&gt;Heat levels at home matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters isn’t just the outdoor temperature. Conditions inside homes vary widely. Some people live in overheated trailers or apartments without cooling. Others have access to reliable air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research aims to explore these differences. Personalized data could reveal how daily exposure shapes long-term health. That could guide public health policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-heat-exposure-and-aging"&gt;Long heat exposure and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that not all gene changes are harmful. Some may reflect adaptation that helps bodies handle heat better. But current evidence leans toward damage, not resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure may reduce physical activity, disturb sleep, and increase stress. These effects accumulate over time, pushing bodies into faster aging even without visible symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By capturing these changes with precision tools like epigenetic clocks, scientists now offer a clearer view into how heat transforms health at its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:54:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNUW5sWjRBclRZTkhCaWhrdzZIaGotOHdEbEQ4VTVyZWNsR1NVOW1WOXZvaTJjVHdjTWtrUTNNSUs5c0ZrWFFKbkNKV1RjNnNlQnpGaE80QlU2RERzTk9nQ1dlaVdDMVNqN0d5N3ZqXzFiQnRWdXVyeTB1UUM0VmZGVWVDa09iR2R2NDdrNTRjWldnNnY2ZUE</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界肺癌日：肿瘤学家揭开关于肺癌的6个常见神话-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;All approved Immunotherapy and targeted therapy molecules are currently available in most of the cancer centres across major cities in India.

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Cancer rates, particularly gastrointestinal cancers, continue to rise among young adults. (Photo by Frame Stock Footage on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans born in 1990 face a 4× higher risk of rectal cancer (and 2× higher for colon cancer) than those born in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Early-onset GI cancers rose 14.8% between 2010 and 2019; pancreatic rates climbed 4.34% per year in 25–29-year-olds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity (BMI ≥30), Western diets, and fatty liver disease drive most of these cancers, which are sporadic, not inherited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Younger patients often face delayed diagnoses, more aggressive treatment with marginal benefit, and greater “financial toxicity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans born in 1990 have four times the risk of developing rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950, according to a sweeping analysis that reveals how dramatically cancer patterns have shifted across generations. This alarming trend extends beyond a single cancer type; gastrointestinal cancers among people under 50 have surged by nearly 15% in just one decade, transforming diseases once considered rare in young people into leading killers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and led by researchers from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, the review examined cancer trends across multiple databases and studies. Between 2010 and 2019, cases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers jumped by 14.8%, with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; now ranking as the top cancer killer for men under 50 and second for women in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these cancers aren’t caused by inherited genetic defects. Instead, researchers point to environmental factors tied to modern life: soaring &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-causing-cancer-young-adults-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rates, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/colorectal-cancer-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets dominated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sedentary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, and exposures that previous generations simply didn’t face. “The rising incidence demonstrates a birth cohort effect, implicating environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increases hit certain groups hardest. Hispanic patients represent more than 22% of young adults diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt;, compared to just 7% of older patients. Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations face disproportionately higher rates of early-onset colorectal cancer compared to their White counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-young-adults"&gt;Why Cancer Rates Are Rising in Young Adults&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer incidence among Americans under 50 jumped from 5.9 cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 by 2017. Among adults aged 25–29, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pancreatic-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence climbed by 4.34% per year beginning in the mid-1990s. Stomach cancer rates rose by 1.6% per year among women under 50 between 2010 and 2019, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/esophageal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases increased by 6.86% per year in 30–39-year-olds and showed a steady early-onset rise overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These patterns mirror troubling trends worldwide, particularly in wealthy nations where Western lifestyles have taken hold. European countries reported significant increases in early-onset colorectal cancer from 2004 to 2016, with the steepest rises — 7.9%, 4.9%, and 1.6% per year — among people in their twenties, thirties, and forties, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several key factors appear to drive this health emergency. Obesity emerges as perhaps the strongest risk factor. Studies consistently show that people with a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; of 30 or higher face nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Diet plays an equally critical role: a Western eating pattern high in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/red-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugar-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt;, and refined grains, while low in fruits and vegetables, has been linked to higher cancer risk. Heavy alcohol use and smoking further compound these effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; represents another major factor largely absent in past generations. This condition, which affects roughly 25% of adults globally and has exploded alongside rising obesity, significantly increases gastrointestinal cancer risk even in people who aren’t severely overweight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unique-challenges-young-cancer-patients-face"&gt;Unique Challenges Young Cancer Patients Face&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond rising numbers, young adults with gastrointestinal cancers encounter challenges that older patients typically avoid. Diagnosis often comes later because neither patients nor doctors initially suspect cancer in someone so young. This delay frequently means the disease has progressed to more advanced stages by the time it’s detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-cancer-psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/a&gt; tend to receive more aggressive treatment than their older counterparts, even though research suggests this intensive approach doesn’t necessarily improve survival outcomes. Studies show that those under 50 are significantly more likely to receive chemotherapy and radiation, but show only marginal survival improvements compared to older patients receiving less intensive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial devastation often follows diagnosis. Researchers have documented that younger cancer patients experience what they term “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/financial-toxicity-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial toxicity&lt;/a&gt;” at much higher rates than older patients. This stems partly from being in peak earning years while facing massive medical bills, and partly from having young families to support during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quality of life impacts can be particularly severe for younger patients. Treatments like pelvic radiation for rectal cancer can affect fertility, sexual function, and bowel control. These concerns are especially relevant for people who may have decades of life ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer disparities along racial and ethnic lines are stark and getting worse. Analysis of California cancer registry data showed that Black Americans had an early-onset colorectal cancer rate of 12.2 per 100,000 compared to 9.2 per 100,000 for White Americans. Five-year survival rates range from 57.6% for Black patients to 69.1% for non-Hispanic White patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-healthcare-is-responding-to-rising-cancer-rates"&gt;How Healthcare Is Responding to Rising Cancer Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare systems are racing to adapt to this new reality. In 2021, the United States lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45, but many experts worry this reactive approach isn’t sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between young and older patients, despite growing evidence that early-onset cancers may behave differently at the molecular level. Young patients often have more aggressive disease features and different genetic profiles, yet they receive essentially the same treatment protocols developed primarily based on studies of older patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some promising developments offer hope. Recent clinical trials have shown that certain intensive treatments may be safely scaled back without compromising outcomes. This is particularly important for younger patients facing decades of potential treatment-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research efforts are now focusing intensively on understanding why certain birth cohorts face higher risks and identifying critical windows during childhood or adolescence when environmental exposures have the most lasting impact. Scientists are also working to develop prevention strategies and screening methods tailored specifically for younger populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these medical advances won’t address the root causes driving this epidemic. As long as obesity rates continue climbing, diets remain dominated by processed foods, and sedentary lifestyles persist, the cancer rates documented in this review are likely to worsen rather than improve. Without dramatic changes to the environmental factors driving these increases, an entire generation faces rectal and other gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer risks&lt;/a&gt; that previous generations never had to confront.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article summarizes a narrative review of existing studies and registry data; it does not constitute medical advice. Readers should consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance on cancer risk and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study represents a narrative review rather than original research with participants. The authors systematically analyzed existing research literature, cancer databases, and registry data to examine trends in early-onset gastrointestinal cancers, defined as those diagnosed before age 50. They reviewed epidemiological data from multiple sources including the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, various national cancer registries, and published studies from around the world. The review focused on colorectal, esophageal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers, examining patterns in incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, genetic features, and treatment outcomes. Rather than conducting new experiments, the researchers synthesized findings from hundreds of existing studies to provide a complete overview of this emerging health issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review documented consistent increases in early-onset gastrointestinal cancer rates globally, with the United States seeing a 14.8% increase between 2010 and 2019. The most striking finding was a birth cohort effect, where Americans born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950. While 10–25% of early-onset cases involve inherited genetic mutations, the majority are sporadic and linked to environmental factors including obesity, Western dietary patterns, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The increases disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations, with significant racial disparities in both incidence and survival rates. Younger patients typically present with more advanced disease stages and receive more intensive treatment than older patients, though survival outcomes vary across different studies and cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a narrative review synthesizing existing literature rather than conducting original research, this paper’s limitations stem from the quality and scope of the studies it analyzed. The authors noted that different studies use varying definitions of “early-onset” cancer, ranging from under 40 to under 60 years old, making direct comparisons challenging. Some cancer registries don’t consistently distinguish between different tumor subtypes, which can affect trend analyses. The review also acknowledged that deeper genomic characterization through whole exome or genome sequencing of large patient cohorts is needed to better understand the molecular differences between early-onset and average-onset cancers. Additionally, many of the risk factor associations come from observational studies rather than controlled trials, limiting the ability to establish definitive causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s easy to grab when running out the door (late for something yet again), sweet enough to feel like a treat, and work well in recipes from smoothies to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60100613/super-moist-banana-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana bread&lt;/a&gt;. So when my editor asked me to eat a banana every day for a week and document how it made me feel, I was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I know the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So if anything, I figured taking on this challenge would help me get closer to eating enough fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened when I ate a banana every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of this experiment, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks to not needing refrigeration. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it on hand when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICELANDIC-PROVISIONS-Caramel-Banana-Creamy/dp/B0D9PC6JVW/ref=sr_1_1_f3_0o_wf?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65545332%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr&lt;/a&gt; (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime (with a glass of milk, of course!). It was very little effort to add a banana to my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of eating bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas might seem basic, but they’re nutritional powerhouses. Here are some of the scientifically backed benefits of eating bananas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains potassium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is a critical nutrient that &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supports heart health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:375 milligrams of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;375 milligrams of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aids digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 grams of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 grams of fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11167165/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;source of prebiotic fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good source of vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One medium banana contains about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults.

Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas contain several antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10465879/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including vitamin C&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banana nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in &lt;a href="https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/resources/nutrition-education-materials/seasonal-produce-guide/bananas#:~:text=Serving%20Size%3A%201%20medium%20banana,105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium banana:;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one medium banana:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates: 27 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugars: 14 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperkalemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hyperkalemia&lt;/a&gt;) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to increase your banana intake, there are plenty of easy (and delicious) ways to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desserts&lt;/strong&gt;: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking&lt;/strong&gt;: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toppings&lt;/strong&gt;: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1La1FKeEo0Q0pGUDRqZ3lnZS16eEVHMXlQNjNVOWJlZHZQTG5QU1RCZjZOZ191QXlMZC1GR05vQ0FQMlNVVlMyOFFBc3hnXzBFMU42ZEtOeUU3MjJkQkZldllsSUlPTVRCbUNLSQ</guid></item><item><title>输精管切除术、疼痛和遗憾： Reddit揭示男性经历的在线论坛-对话</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNTkhBTlA5cXVnSFVOR3RScEZRTU5VRll1OUZSaDJXa0NJU04xenc2TVY2MjBBR3BxdzMtN1NreFBmanlHZDhhSXNFcWQwQmFWejlPT2ZpMUhPVER5aUVQZWNmRFc2ajBSMmFhQjRjRUtlby1FbUpCR2pxZUlNaHJHRndDcXo3WjI1RXJpdVZMRlVZdU15QzBOQUNDQ1RuQVNQVzNXQTcya1JpdFNOdzByRERoa2dpMmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vasectomy has long been regarded as a permanent, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5110415/"&gt;safe and effective form&lt;/a&gt; of contraception. Its benefits are often summarised as minimally invasive and largely risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that may not be the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9563195/"&gt;vasectomy rates in the UK have declined significantly&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a puzzling trend, given that the procedure’s efficacy hasn’t changed. What has arguably shifted is how men talk about it. Not in doctors’ offices, but online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an AI researcher working with large-scale public data, I led a 2025 study using natural language processing (NLP) – a branch of artificial intelligence that analyses patterns in human language – to examine thousands of posts from r/vasectomy and r/postvasectomypain, which are subreddits (topic-specific discussion forums) on Reddit, a social media platform where users share and comment on content in themed communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal wasn’t to weigh in on urology (I’m not that kind of doctor), but to explore the emotional tone and self-reported outcomes in digital spaces where users speak candidly and in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/ijun.70016"&gt;The findings&lt;/a&gt; are revealing and raise important questions about informed consent, online health discourse and the growing influence of social data on healthcare communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fear, regret and pain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common emotional response to vasectomy, whether being considered or already undergone, is fear. To assess this, we used &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/NRCLex/"&gt;a tool called NRClex&lt;/a&gt;, a crowd-trained emotion classifier. This is an AI model trained on thousands of labelled examples to detect emotional tone in text. It found that “fear” dominated more than 70% of user-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t surprising. Men on Reddit ask questions like “How bad is the pain?” “How long does it last?” and “Will I regret this?” These are not rare concerns: they’re central to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While overall sentiment analysis shows that most users report positive outcomes, a significant minority express deep regret and ongoing pain – sometimes lasting for years after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pain is often described as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/vasectomy-male-sterilisation/complications/"&gt;post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS)&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively little-known condition defined by new or chronic scrotal pain that continues for more than three months after the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11947242/"&gt;PVPS is poorly understood&lt;/a&gt; and may have multiple causes, some anatomical, some neurological and some still unclear. Though some health authorities describe it as “rare,” our Reddit data suggests it could be more common, or at least more disruptive, than currently acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We analysed more than 11,000 Reddit posts and found that the word “pain” appeared in over 3,700 of them; roughly one-third. In many cases, the pain described persisted well beyond the expected recovery period. The word “month” appeared in nearly 900 pain-related posts, while “year” appeared in over 600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy. Post-surgical pain is typically expected to resolve within days or weeks. Yet our dataset suggests that 6%–8% of Reddit users discussing vasectomy report longer-term discomfort – a rate that aligns with the upper estimates in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17850378/"&gt;urological studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38989696/"&gt;More recent research&lt;/a&gt;, including a large-scale postoperative study, argues that the incidence is likely much lower, perhaps under 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we must emphasise that these are self-reported experiences. Not all mentions of “pain” equate to a formal PVPS diagnosis. It’s also important to acknowledge that people who are dissatisfied with a medical procedure are generally more likely to post about it online – a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10966444/"&gt;well-recognised bias in social data&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, the volume, consistency and emotional intensity of these posts suggest the issue warrants closer attention from clinicians and researchers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more strikingly, around 2% of posts mention both “pain” and “regret”, implying serious, potentially life-altering consequences for a small but significant group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On r/postvasectomypain – a subreddit specifically dedicated to discussing PVPS – the tone is even more sobering. Unsurprisingly, 74% of posts describe persistent, long-term pain. Additionally, 23% mention pain during sex and 27% report changes in sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts on this forum also frequently reference vasectomy reversal surgery far more often than more specialised interventions such as microsurgical denervation: a complex nerve-removal procedure used in severe cases of chronic testicular pain, typically when other treatments have failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From AI to andrology: an ethical crossroads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is a professor of AI and physics analysing pain in urology forums?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because in today’s digital world, people increasingly turn to online platforms like Reddit for health advice, peer support and decision-making – often before speaking to a clinician. As an AI researcher, I believe we have a responsibility to examine how these discussions shape public understanding, and what they can teach us about real-world healthcare challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s possible that the drop in vasectomy uptake is linked, at least in part, to the open and emotional sharing of negative outcomes online. These posts are not scaremongering. They’re detailed, candid and often highly specific. They represent a type of real-world evidence that clinical trials and formal studies don’t always capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what should we take from all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms like “rare”, often used in consent forms and clinical conversations, can obscure the complexity and variability of patient outcomes. Pain following vasectomy, whether mild, temporary, chronic or debilitating, appears common enough to warrant more transparent and nuanced communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an argument against vasectomy. It remains a safe, effective, and empowering option in reproductive planning. But truly informed consent should reflect both the clinical literature and the experiences of those who undergo the procedure, especially when such experiences are now publicly available in large volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where online forums double as health diaries, support networks and informal research registries, we must take them seriously. Medical language matters. Terms like “rare”, “uncommon” or “low risk” carry real emotional and moral weight. They shape expectations and influence decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If even a small percentage of men experience long-term pain after vasectomy, that risk should be communicated clearly, in plain English – ideally with a range of percentages drawn from published studies. &lt;/p&gt;
