A new nationwide study points to a far less familiar culprit that is increasing at break‑neck speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital stays tied to this type of stroke rose 400% between 2005 and 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.brownhealth.org/providers/shadi-yaghi-md"&gt;Shadi Yaghi, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular neurologist at &lt;a href="https://www.brownhealth.org/providers/shadi-yaghi-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;, led the team that reviewed 125,102 records to understand this disturbing trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strokes-from-cervical-artery-dissection"&gt;Strokes from “cervical artery dissection”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cervical artery dissection&lt;/a&gt; happens when the inner lining of a neck artery splits and blood forces its way between the layers, creating a flap that can slow flow or spawn a clot, causing an ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9272308/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in four strokes&lt;/a&gt; in adults younger than fifty trace back to an undetected tear, making the condition a top threat during prime working years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tear often follows a car crash, sports collision, or heavy lift, yet even an awkward reach into the backseat can trigger it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ultrasound and magnetic‑resonance techniques now reveal tiny mural bruises that older scanners missed, so today’s numbers reflect both a true rise and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eyes-serve-as-an-early-warning-system-for-stroke-risk/"&gt;sharper detection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clues-something-is-wrong"&gt;Clues something is wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden one‑sided headache or neck pain, sometimes paired with a droopy eyelid, is the classic red flag that emergency clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dramatic-temperature-changes-linked-to-half-a-million-stroke-deaths/"&gt;learn to spot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients hear a pulsing “whoosh” in one ear, a clue that turbulent blood is racing past the tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When symptoms appear vague, physicians look for Horner’s syndrome, a pinpoint pupil with a partly closed lid, that often accompanies the injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency departments rely on computed tomography angiography, a dye scan that maps blood flow in minutes and is now the preferred first test in young &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stroke-risk-is-elevated-by-air-pollution-and-traffic-noise/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-numbers-keep-climbing"&gt;Why the numbers keep climbing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidence climbed from eleven to forty‑six cases per million people over fifteen years, an average ten‑percent rise every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic and Black Americans saw the steepest gains, nearly doubling the increase noted in white patients, suggesting disparities in both exposure to trauma and access to early vascular care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheaper scanners let smaller hospitals perform &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/peanuts-have-a-beneficial-impact-on-vascular-health/"&gt;vascular&lt;/a&gt; studies on site. Clinicians also scan first and ask questions later, catching tears that once slipped under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strokes that are not fatal can lead to long‑term disability, poor mental health and reduced quality of life,” stated Yaghi, underscoring why &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cell-therapy-improves-brain-activity-after-stroke/"&gt;earlier diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharpest rise occurred in people older than sixty‑five, hinting that age‑related vessel changes and more liberal imaging are uncovering cases once blamed on arthritis pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-cervical-artery-strokes"&gt;Recognizing cervical artery strokes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine papers link dissections to wrestling throws, surfing wipeouts, and yoga headstands that force the neck past its usual range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A case report describes a thirty‑four‑year‑old woman who suffered a fatal stroke just hours after chiropractic neck manipulation, reminding clinicians to weigh benefits against rare but severe risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with connective‑tissue disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ehlers‑Danlos syndrome&lt;/a&gt; face extra risk, and studies tie hypertension and migraine with aura to the condition as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertebral tears demand respect because a nationwide follow‑up study found they almost doubled stroke risk within ninety days even when the first hospital stay ended without brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaps-in-treatment-and-follow-up"&gt;Gaps in treatment and follow‑up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines favor starting an antiplatelet drug such as aspirin for three to six months, reserving anticoagulants for complicated or vertebral artery dissection that extends toward the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occlusive tears may call for stronger medication, and many centers reorder imaging within a week to confirm blood is flowing through a safe channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intravenous clot‑busting medicine remains safe when given within the standard window, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.124.039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endovascular stenting is saved for repeat attacks that break through medication, with observational series reporting technical success in more than ninety‑percent of treated segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tele‑stroke clinics now let rural patients secure follow‑up scans and medication checks without long travel, a shift that could narrow the racial gap seen in the fresh data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lowering-cervical-artery-stroke-risk"&gt;Lowering cervical artery stroke risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear a seat belt, raise the headrest to eye level, and avoid twisting the neck while lifting heavy objects, even on short trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always secure loose cargo so you are not tempted to reach suddenly while driving; it is a small habit that keeps your shoulders, and arteries, out of harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength‑training experts advise easing back into weights with lighter loads and steady breathing after imaging confirms healing, guidance drawn from sports case &lt;a href="https://practicalneurology.com/diseases-diagnoses/stroke/bilateral-vertebral-artery-dissection-and-occlusion-after-a-long-distance-open-water-swim/32070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. A stubborn one‑sided headache or new neck pain after minor trauma is reason enough to seek medical care, especially if an eye looks different or speech sounds slurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing direct oral anticoagulants and ultrasound markers that might spot a weak artery before it fails, while genetic studies hunt for clues in connective‑tissue biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 23:22:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQeW5JUXFQenJSNm5JN3RkWElBWVdiYUFHbGZJTDFKRk4zc1licFR0cHFqZzE3M1lSRWE1NE40Xzl3S2lkbGJrY0lxLWZwdHYwM21DMlEwUmE4SFRvTVNTRWFpMTFjZXZoa2pLWVlBMGZHNFBPWVBlVUtoc2o2dmZMdmNLODJ2ZlBBX3pVYWptR1BwN3ZrOFJjQzFFX2djM29oQU5iUmQ1dVhFd3hG</guid></item><item><title>新药为超罕见遗传性疾病提供了潜在的治愈方法- BBC | New drug offers potential cure for ultra rare inherited condition - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50UUFlX0lJSkVoR0V3RVdsVmFwZHQ4bmtpbXgwckV0SXgzNGE2NUtMLW9BNXo4NzIyUllndWJVMjJwM3FjSTlKVzExemdQUFZ0eXZCZ2w3el9xQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBSaVpUWWJncFlhMzZEa25MR1V4QmlXT1RiUGJNMWhnZFNYN1ppWWpEMVVqSGNEV3gwQzI5WnZucThRWV9idE1mbFJtSm1XWG9xdXJ4eVVmZ2xmRXNta3dV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Drug for rare disease brings 'joy and hope'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Fergus Walsh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Mary Catchpole, smiling with her hair tied back and wearing glasses.

It can cause organs and lymph nodes to swell, and the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue. Patients are also at risk of lymphoma, a cancer which affects a type of white blood cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drug, branded Joenja, is taken twice daily as tablets, and works by blocking the enzyme, allowing the immune system to work normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jimmy told the BBC: "This is something I have dreamt about since Mary was first diagnosed; it is giving her the chance to live a normal life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary suffered regular chest infections as a child and has been repeatedly treated with intravenous antibiotics, nebulisers and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She has been taking the leniolisib tablets for less than a month but has already stopped some other medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Chandra, who is Mary's consultant and has treated several other family members, said the drug was a "potential cure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary is rethinking about how she will live in future: "I want to go on more adventures and take risks because all I've ever known is medication, needles, and hospital appointments, whereas now I can find out who I truly am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The faulty gene is carried on the maternal line so there is a 50:50 chance it will be passed to affected women's children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary said she would like to become a dance teacher, while continuing her work as a teaching assistant. She said she had been cautious around people because of the risk of infection but no longer felt scared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Sergey Nejentsev from the University of Cambridge who led the research that discovered APDS said: "As soon as we understood the cause of APDS, we immediately realised that certain drugs could be used to inhibit the enzyme that is activated in these patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Leniolisib does precisely that. I am delighted that we finally have a treatment which will change the lives of APDS patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Leniolisib has a list price of £352,000 a year, but was approved as cost effective by the health regulator NICE after the NHS negotiated a substantial, confidential discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NICE estimates the drug could benefit up to 50 patients over the age of 12 in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof James Palmer, NHS England's Medical Director for Specialised Commissioning, said: "This treatment could be life-changing for those affected by this debilitating genetic disorder, and this important step forward is another example of the NHS's commitment to offering access to innovative medicines for those living with rare conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 23:01:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50UUFlX0lJSkVoR0V3RVdsVmFwZHQ4bmtpbXgwckV0SXgzNGE2NUtMLW9BNXo4NzIyUllndWJVMjJwM3FjSTlKVzExemdQUFZ0eXZCZ2w3el9xQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBSaVpUWWJncFlhMzZEa25MR1V4QmlXT1RiUGJNMWhnZFNYN1ppWWpEMVVqSGNEV3gwQzI5WnZucThRWV9idE1mbFJtSm1XWG9xdXJ4eVVmZ2xmRXNta3dV</guid></item><item><title>改变一个基因可以恢复小鼠的一些组织再生- Ars Technica | Changing one gene can restore some tissue regeneration to mice - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZWtCa2JUMVlaTGptOGtsX3liNkp5REdQUl9GSGtJejdKVjZBNVRFd3h3di1kZFEwcWZuSGxucFl2WmM5ZlpERkNFbHNZOFd1UFphN0RoUVdtNFdWY1NCUmNmTDRXMW1qTWxHTzNvV3RKSXlkNV9UVXhHOTdReGNWWWZsYkRLN3k5ZkNva3BxY1pvbjFmandiS1BuR0RZRjlkNlpsNXdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Regeneration is a trick many animals, including lizards, starfish, and octopuses, have mastered. Axolotls, a salamander species originating in Mexico, can regrow pretty much everything from severed limbs, through eyes and parts of brain, to the spinal cord. Mammals, though, have mostly lost this ability somewhere along their evolutionary path. Regeneration persisted, in a limited number of tissues, in just a few mammalian species like rabbits or goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were trying to learn how certain animals lost their regeneration capacity during evolution and then put back the responsible gene or pathway to reactivate the regeneration program,” says Wei Wang, a researcher at the National Institute of Biological Sciences in Beijing. Wang’s team has found one of those inactive regeneration genes, activated it, and brough back a limited regeneration ability to mice that did not have it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of mice and bunnies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea Wang and his colleagues had was a comparative study to compare how the wound healing process works in regenerating and non-regenerating mammalian species. They chose rabbits as their regenerating mammals and mice as the non-regenerating species. As the reference organ, the team picked the ear pinna. “We wanted relatively simple structure that was easy to observe and yet composed of many different cell types,” Wang says. The test involved punching holes in the ear pinna of rabbits and mice and tracking the wound-repairing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing process began in the same way in rabbits and mice. Within the first few days after the injury, a blastema—a mass of heterogeneous cells—formed at the wound site. “Both rabbits and mice will heal the wounds after a few days,” Wang explains. “But between the 10th and 15th day, you will see the major difference.” In this timeframe, the earhole in rabbits started to become smaller. There were outgrowths above the blastema—the animals were producing more tissue. In mice, on the other hand, the healing process halted completely, leaving a hole in the ear.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the US saw a higher rate than the Asian country - 1,307 cases per 100,000 people, compared to China's 490 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US has the fifth-highest cancer rate in the world, and cases are climbing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America made up about 13 percent of the 19 million cases recorded &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13197079/cancer-epidemic-young-people-america-uk-india-south-africa.html"&gt;worldwide in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, more than the combined share from all of Africa (six percent), Latin America and the Caribbean (seven percent), and Oceania (less than two percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And global diagnoses are only expected to increase, reaching 35million a year by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung cancer was the most commonly diagnosed among both men and women, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide. In the US, an estimated 236,740 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, and 130,000 people died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer in women made up 12 percent of cases worldwide, colorectal accounted for 10 percent, prostate at seven percent, and stomach at five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer is now the leading cause of death in Americans under 85, according to the American Cancer Society's 2024 report. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains the second-leading cause of death overall in the US, it has surpassed heart disease as the top killer in younger age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anticipated spike in new cancer diagnoses is mainly due to population growth and aging, but experts are increasingly blaming environmental toxins and ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And though cancer rates among people under 50 are on the rise, particularly colorectal cancer, the disease still primarily afflicts seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This rise in projected cancer cases by 2050 is solely due to the aging and growth of the population, assuming current incidence rates remain unchanged,’ Dr Hyuna Sung, senior principal scientist at the American Cancer Society, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/GlobalCancerStatistics2024#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNotably%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of%20major,barring%20any%20large%20scale%20interventions.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Notably, the prevalence of major risk factors such as consumption of unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking are increasing in many parts of the world and will likely exacerbate the future burden of cancer barring any large scale interventions.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the projected rise in cancer cases by 2050 stems from more than just aging populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Population growth explains part of the increase, but preventable risk factors —poor diet, lack of access to screenings, and chemical exposures — are also driving the disproportionate spikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the US diagnoses about one in six global cancer cases, it accounts for just seven percent of deaths worldwide, thanks to advanced treatments and fast drug approvals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that almost half of all cases and about 56 percent of cancer deaths in 2022 occurred in Asia, where over 59 percent of the world’s population lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates in Africa and Asia are much higher than cases, partly because cancers there are often found late and are harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Europe has more cancer cases and deaths than expected for its population, making up about 20 percent of global cases and deaths, though it has less than 10 percent of the world’s people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 20 million cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2022, but that number is projected to balloon to more than 35 million cases by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer in men is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 118 countries, followed by lung cancer among both sexes in 33 countries, and liver, colorectal, and stomach cancer ranking in first place in 11, nine, and eight countries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2050, lung cancer cases will climb from about 2.5 million in 2022 to roughly four million. Deaths will also climb from approximately 1.8 million to about three million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Global breast cancer cases are projected to surge from 2.3 million to 3.5 million by 2050, with deaths rising from 666,000 to 1 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women (excluding skin cancer), diagnosed in 157 countries, while cervical cancer leads in 25 others. The US saw 288,000 new cases in 2022, with over 319,000 projected for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 10 cancer types cause over 60 percent of all cases and deaths globally. Leading the pack is lung cancer (12.4 percent of cases), followed by breast (11.6 percent), colorectal (9.6 percent), prostate (7.3 percent), and stomach cancers (4.9 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer cases will skyrocket from 1.9 million to 3 million globally by 2050, fueled by processed diets and rising early-onset cases. In 2023, 19,550 Americans under 50 were diagnosed with CRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths will climb from 904,000 to 1.4 million, especially in regions with poor screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the US diagnoses about one in six global cancer cases, it accounts for just seven percent of deaths worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North America, pancreatic cancer cases and deaths will both increase sharply, with minimal survival improvements expected. Obesity and diabetes are key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer is set to explode—from 1.5 million cases today to a staggering 2.5 million by 2050—as the world’s population ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths will leap from 397,000 to 600,000, hitting sub-Saharan Africa hardest, where life-saving treatments remain out of reach for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer cases will rise from 865,000 to 1.2 million. Deaths will remain high, nearing one million, due to late detection in poorer parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s on track to become more common, fueled by America's growing struggles with obesity, diabetes, and heavy drinking—even as hepatitis-linked cases fade.

It was really intense, it was a sharp constant pain," she said, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardiner said on GoFundMe that she went “back and forth” with doctors for months and was initially prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/lansoprazole/#:~:text=1.-,About%20lansoprazole,prevent%20and%20treat%20stomach%20ulcers." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lansoprazole;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lansoprazole&lt;/a&gt;, a medication used to treat heartburn, acid reflux and other stomach conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she said she was referred to a non-specific symptoms pathway, which according to the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/faster-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Health Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;, helps patients “who do not fit clearly into a single ‘urgent cancer’ referral pathway, but who are nonetheless at risk of being diagnosed with cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t aware this was a cancer pathway until I went to my appointment,” Gardiner said on her fundraiser, adding that she then underwent an endoscopy through her throat, a procedure in which doctors can look inside patient's digestive system using a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, June 13, she and her fiancé Callum had a meeting at St. James’s University Hospital, where Gardiner learned she had linitus plastica, an aggressive stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In that room, my whole world crumbled,” Gardiner said, adding that doctor found the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and other internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then I heard the word ‘incurable’ and all I thought of was Arlo. How can this be happening when I have a 2-year-old son?” Gardiner recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I even laughed and asked Callum if what they were saying was real,” she added on GoFundMe. “I think I went through every emotion you could think of in the space of 5 minutes. But it is real, and the fact of it is I have stage 4 terminal cancer and I don’t know how long I have left.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes the life expectancy for this form of cancer is about a year.

						&lt;p&gt;A rabid fox that bit a man on Tuesday in Wake County tested positive for rabies on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to a release from the county, Animal Control responded to an animal attack in a neighborhood near the corner of Pulley Town Road and Thornburg Drive in Wake Forest. Animal Control officers later captured the fox and tested it for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county said that the fox didn’t bite anyone else. The county added that Animal Control would canvas the neighborhood and see if any neighbors need their pets vaccinated, and asked anyone who may have encountered the fox to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth rabies bite incident in Wake County this month. &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/rabid-fox-bites-person-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;Three different animals, including two foxes, had previously attacked people in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025/"&gt;Fayetteville, a fox attacked a home inspector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County health leaders provide the following general tips to help minimize rabies risk:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						Newton, Massachusetts, school leaders have mandated that all students must have their vaccinations up to date before classes resume this fall. A recent review of student vaccination records by Newton Schools' new Superintendent Anna Nolin revealed that 182 students do not have all the state-required vaccinations, including 42 students not fully vaccinated against measles. During the pandemic, some families received waivers for vaccines, but these will no longer be accepted, and students without full vaccinations will not be allowed back in the fall."I'm fine with it. And to be honest with you, I didn't even realize it wasn't there. So we always stuck with our vaccination programs with the doctor and nothing lapsed on our end," one Newton father said.Not everyone is on board. "If I had my choice, I would not vaccinate them at all," one Newton mother said. "I think the vaccines are poison."The unvaccinated students represent about 1.5 percent of Newton's student population. A health expert warned that if these students are grouped together in the same school or neighborhood, it could pose a risk of an outbreak."If you have multiple children in the same grade, for example, and (there's an) introduction of measles because one of those children travels to an area with measles transmission and brings it back, you could get an outbreak and you could get serious illness," said Dr. Shira Doron of Tufts Medical Center.Massachusetts allows families to request an exemption from school vaccination requirements for medical or religious reasons. State lawmakers are considering a bill to eliminate the religious exemption."Several states have gotten rid of them in recent years, including California, Connecticut, Maine and New York, all around here.  So we're hoping to be the next one," said Katie Blair, of Massachusetts Families for Vaccines.

Kennedy Jr. voted Thursday to effectively remove an ingredient from flu shots, achieving a longtime, controversial goal of anti-vaccine activists and illustrating how their priorities are becoming official government guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TPN48APTT06X23Z856QGVMHG0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vote to no longer recommend influenza vaccines that contain the preservative thimerosal, based on the presentation of a single vaccine critic, is likely to have limited impact because the vast majority of flu shots are thimerosal-free. But it would probably make the shots more expensive and harder to receive in parts of the country, public health experts said, and showed the panel’s willingness to disregard scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZCUMVYMIVGQLODTZWUHEB5KCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those experts were surprised that Kennedy’s newly reformulated Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) abruptly added thimerosal to the agenda of its first meeting because they considered the issue resolved decades ago. Staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a report, later taken offline, showing that the preservative is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GVVOJMDS2NEDZHYVWAGQM6DZUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Kennedy, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/?itid=ap_laurenweber_1" target="_blank"&gt;founder of the anti-vaccine advocacy&lt;/a&gt; group Children’s Health Defense, has long criticized the use of thimerosal because it metabolizes into a form of mercury in the body that he says is dangerous.

&lt;p&gt;The extent of the national outbreak has rocketed measles from a back-of-mind issue — one rarely, if ever, encountered by a whole generation of Americans — to a pressing public health concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is completely preventable,” Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is spreading almost universally among people who either haven’t been vaccinated or whose vaccination status is not known, authorities note. But the MMR shots, so named because they also afford protection against mumps and rubella, has long been in the crosshairs of anti-vaccine activists and skeptics — some of whom are now in charge of shaping U.S. policy regarding childhood immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 17 cases of measles reported so far this year among California residents, up from the 15 reported all of last year, according to the state Department of Public Health. Doctors have been increasingly on alert for measles, which for decades has been so rare that many physicians haven’t encountered a single case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that recent rarity, many may be unfamiliar with how readily measles can spread — or the serious symptoms it can cause.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is not just a mild childhood disease,” Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health and state public health officer, said in a recent briefing to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has a death rate of 1 for every 500 to 1,000 cases, Pan said. Nationwide, more than 145 people have been hospitalized with measles so far this year, federal data show, and many of those hospitalized have needed intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This can cause very severe disease — often causes a viral pneumonia that is severe enough to need intensive care,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to science. It is so infectious you can catch it just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after they left, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uptick in confirmed measles cases in California, while still somewhat concerning for local public health officials, pales compared with the significant outbreak that began in Texas earlier this year and has since spread to surrounding states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas has reported at least 750 measles cases; New Mexico, 81; Kansas, 80; North Dakota, 28; and Montana, 23, according to the respective states’ health departments. Michigan has reported 15 cases; Ohio and Illinois, 10, and Arkansas and Indiana, eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of the measles cases are associated with outbreaks tied to close-knit communities with low rates of vaccination, according to the CDC. Recent outbreaks have occurred in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities, starting last fall in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to a large gathering in New Brunswick; then in Texas and New Mexico in late January; and more recently in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, according to the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AP reported that officials in Mexico and the U.S. say the outbreaks in their countries match the strain found in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that 95% of this year’s measles cases in the U.S. occurred among people who were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. About 29% of cases occurred in children younger than 5, with an additional 37% in those age 5 to 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the U.S. has reported 1,227 confirmed measles cases so far this year. That’s already rivaling the highest single-year total seen this century — 1,274 were reported in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would have to look back a generation to find a higher total than that: 2,126 cases were reported nationwide in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And those are probably an underreporting,” Pan said of this year’s case count. Doctors, she said, have learned that most people affected by the measles outbreaks are reluctant to get themselves or their children tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three measles deaths have been reported so far this year, according to the CDC. Two were Texas school-aged children — both of whom were unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, according to state health officials. The other was an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico who didn’t seek medical care before dying, according to health authorities there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One death has been reported in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. That person was also unvaccinated. More than 3,300 confirmed and suspected measles cases have also been reported in Canada so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One infant, who was infected with measles before being born premature, died in Canada earlier this month, according to Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer for the province of Ontario. The infant’s mother was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus, but measles “may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death,” Moore said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year marks the first time a child has died from measles in the United States since 2003 — and the child in that case had a rare genetic condition that impaired the immune system. It’s also the first time since the 1990s that more than two people have died from measles in the U.S. in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most associated with its telltale rash, health officials warn that measles can cause symptoms that cross the boundary from discomfort to danger. Measles can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. And years after contracting measles, people can later develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, a rare but fatal complication resulting from a weakened form of the virus remaining in the body, and later infecting the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a really, really unusual time to see this many deaths — and seeing previously healthy children with a vaccine-preventable death in the United States,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can also cause something called “ immune amnesia.” “It can actually suppress people’s immune systems for a few years after having that measles infection,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreaks in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico are so severe that state health officials are recommending early vaccination in babies as young as 6 months in the hardest-hit counties. Those officials are also recommending a second dose for many children earlier than the typical schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard CDC recommendation is that children receive the first of two measles vaccine shots when they turn 1, unless they are traveling internationally, in which case they can get vaccinated at 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, there is no active measles outbreak, so there’s no recommendation for additional or accelerated vaccine doses, Pan said. Most of California’s measles cases this year have involved people who traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping matters is California’s relatively high vaccination rate among kindergartners. For the 2023-24 school year, 96.2% of California’s kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, according to the CDC — one of the higher rates of any state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest figure is down slightly from the 96.5% seen the year earlier, but it remains above the levels seen prior to 2014-15, when a severe measles outbreak linked to Disneyland prompted state legislators to strengthen vaccination requirements for children who attend school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts aim for a 95% vaccination rate for measles to guard against outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, California’s measles case rate remains much lower than the national rate. But that doesn’t mean the state is invulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are settings in which unvaccinated people can cluster together, such as group outings of children who are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerable setting can be doctor’s offices. In 2008, an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy returned home to San Diego from a trip to Switzerland, became sick, then went to school and was taken to the pediatrician. Investigators found that measles then spread to 11 other children who were either unvaccinated or too young to be vaccinated — five in his school, four who were in the pediatrician’s office at the same time he was, and both of his siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those infected were three infants younger than 1, one of whom was hospitalized for two days, according to a report published by the CDC. Another infant traveled by plane to Hawaii while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some California counties also have measles vaccination rates for kindergartners that are below the 95% goal. For the 2023-24 school year, San Diego County’s rate is 94.8%; San Bernardino County’s is 93.5%; Santa Cruz County’s is 91.8%; and Kern County’s is 90.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a measles outbreak in Los Angeles County was centered in an Orthodox Jewish community, with a number of patients living in Westside L.A., the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. In early 2019, California’s biggest measles outbreak was in Butte County, and started after a man visited the Philippines, a country that was then in the midst of a massive outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time measles caused scores of deaths nationwide was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1989 to 1991, there were about 55,000 cases and more than 130 suspected measles-associated deaths, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, that epidemic was the worst between 1988 and 1991 — with 18,000 cases, 3,500 hospital admissions and 70 deaths reported, according to state health officials. A big problem officials identified at that time was that poor parents could not afford vaccinations for their children. One of the nation’s largest outbreaks in 1989 involved mostly preschool-aged children in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the outbreak, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended a second dose of the measles vaccine be given between the ages of 4 and 6. And in the early 1990s, the federal government created the Vaccines for Children program, which funds a number of vaccinations for children with low-income parents. In 2000, officials declared that measles was no longer being continuously transmitted locally in the U.S., and new cases were only found when someone was infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. County has recorded four cases of measles so far this year among residents, up from one all of last year. Most of the cases this year were associated with someone who either traveled internationally or to domestic areas suffering community transmission of measles, according to the local Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also two reported cases among non-county residents this year, including an infant traveling through Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from South Korea who was returning home to Orange County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were six non-L.A. County residents who had measles while traveling through L.A. County; four had traveled through Los Angeles International Airport while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With measles cases rising across the country and globally, it’s important for unprotected individuals to consider preventive measures. Immunization provides the best protection. Additionally, anyone who was exposed should monitor for symptoms,” the Orange County Health Care Agency said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes. People can be contagious from about four days before the rash begins through four days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those suspecting they have measles should call their medical provider before they go to the doctor’s office to avoid potentially exposing other patients, the Health Care Agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash traditionally starts at the hairline and moves its way down the body, according to Pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser has seen one case of measles this past month, which was in the Santa Clarita area, Hudson said. Health officials said people were possibly exposed to the contagious individual at a Costco, Trader Joe’s and Walmart on the afternoon of May 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, has an excellent safety record. Hundreds of millions of children have safely received the vaccine worldwide,” she said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrz1ko005f3b7535jml3jv@published"&gt;My girlfriend lost a lot of weight during a very rough patch, and while things are better now, every time the clothes come off, I see her ribs and hip bones and feel so guilty I can barely get hard.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdsgil0005z3b75yo7qnvxi@published"&gt;I have a chronic illness. Last year, a new doctor switched me to a completely new drug combination. It had severe mental health side effects that neither he nor I caught on to. I became paranoid and left my girlfriend out of the blue. I burned professional bridges and hurt people I loved in different, bizarre ways. I was lucky—it only lasted two months. I had a terrifying inpatient hold, got off the medication, and started to rebuild my life. It honestly feels like a movie supervillain took the wheel for two months and tried to destroy everything I care about. It’s painful, and I’m on a waitlist for therapists who take my insurance now that I’m no longer eligible for acute care.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvhr000183b75tuxagam9@published"&gt;I apologized, and my girlfriend took me back. We’ve mostly gotten on the same page. She knows what happened, and I take responsibility for it, but she doesn’t blame me for the things beyond my control. But while I was sick and right after, she lost a lot of weight from the stress. She used to be curvy with big hips and big breasts, overweight on paper. Now she’s what her doctor says is healthy, but her face looks hollow, and she has visible bones where she never used to. She bruises more easily, and I can’t stop thinking about how I hurt her emotionally, and now it’s visible physically. It’s messing with my head when we do have sex, and she has messy feelings about her very slow weight re-gain, so I don’t want to bring it up.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvlwo001e3b75fk0kk0cf@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich Juzwiak: &lt;/strong&gt;Sometimes I think grief or guilt can be a little bit selfish and tainting. Obviously, our writer affected their girlfriend’s life a lot. But she is also an independent person who responded to this the way that she did.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvp6k001o3b75cidjq18w@published"&gt;And so, even though the letter writer’s behavior seemed to lead to her weight loss, it was the girlfriend responding as well. So it’s a little bit egocentric to say, “This is all my fault. I did this and now I’m looking at what I did,” even if it was kind of triggered by this event. The girlfriend is an adult as well, who made her decisions and who responded accordingly. I don’t know that the weight loss was entirely in her control, but objectively speaking, I don’t think that this is completely the letter writer’s fault, and thus, they should not have to carry all this guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvnub001j3b75apm70aij@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Stoya: &lt;/strong&gt;It very much seems like the movie supervillain narrative is the dominant one here. And while it could, for a different person, lead them to think, “It’s like some other person took control, and now my life is ruined, and I have no responsibility here,” our writer seems to have gone in the complete opposite direction, which is that they, through a complicated choice—which we can dig into in a minute—allowed a supervillain to control of their brain and body and have caused all this harm.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvrox001t3b75egazxnls@published"&gt;It’s also possible that the girlfriend has another health issue going on that has nothing to do with the writer, and everything just coincidentally occurred at once. Or that the stress that the girlfriend went through, because of what was happening with the writer, caused a first flare-up of something that was an underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvtq1001y3b75lnbsbkr3@published"&gt;So even though it’s the girlfriend’s responsibility to take care of her own health, I would, in case the girlfriend is also reading this, encourage her to get a medical opinion about what’s happening. Don’t let this narrative lock in a set of beliefs that then prevent important medical follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvvjd00233b75achn5s5y@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvxdh00283b75wije7p3x@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not an expert on bodies, but the bruising more easily feels like a big flag.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrvyk9002d3b75w82rnl6u@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. The letter writer mentions the girlfriend has messy feelings about her very slow weight regain. And the writer mentions, “I don’t want to bring that up.” But what’s that about? What is the actual goal here? How does the girlfriend feel about this stuff? Is she actively trying to gain the weight back? And why? And is it the letter writer’s influence?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrw1cp002i3b75u9a0fw37@published"&gt;Because what happened in the past is in the past, and there has been forgiveness. Please don’t pressure her to gain that weight back now, if you feel some responsibility for her weight loss. In particular, what complicates things here, too, is that she’s been told that this is now a healthy weight by a doctor, which could have its own kind of prejudices. Doctors can be very tough on their patients about weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrw3en002n3b75iib29jc3@published"&gt;So I don’t want to automatically side with the doctor. But there is a possibility that the writer is so wrapped up in this narrative and their guilt that they’re, again, not seeing the bigger picture. This might be what the girlfriend wants. Maybe this is healthier for her, for whatever reason, because, obviously, people can be healthy at lots of different weights. But weight can have a lot of complicated repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrw5bp002s3b75zkvb3dik@published"&gt;So I would just, as much as possible, try to take a step back and let her be. Maybe having a conversation to get some clarity on where she is at exactly and what her goals are could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrw779002x3b7548n85fsl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;For sure. So let’s talk about guilt and blame in the situation that led up to why our writer wrote in. It is perfectly reasonable when you have any kind of health condition, including a chronic illness, to put a lot of weight on the medical advice of the doctor in question. That’s a totally normal thing humans do, even when we’re talking about chronic reproductive system difficulties in people with ovaries, and uteruses, and all these parts that medical science has not studied as well as we would like.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrw99i00323b75tccdrv3e@published"&gt;Still, you go to a doctor, and unless the doctor seems completely unhinged, or is telling you something that is at odds with, for instance, basic anatomy, you’re probably going to say, “OK, we’re going to do this the doctor’s way.” So listening to your doctor at the time is not something to beat yourself up over. And the doctor bears some responsibility for knowing that severe mental health side effects are possible, and for communicating to the patient. Whether we’re talking about RFK Jr. or women who are fed up with super heavy periods being brushed off, there’s only so much doing your own research that a patient, without having a medical degree themselves, can really be expected to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwb9n00373b75wtoqdiih@published"&gt;So while we, or the writer, might feel that perhaps it would’ve been more ideal for the writer to have noticed, “These thoughts are strange for me. I’m going to check in with my doctor or get into a mental health professional’s office ASAP,” I don’t know that it’s a reasonable expectation for anyone to notice that they’re going off the rails in a way that they aren’t familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwdv2003c3b75ecrxtzf2@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. And the greater point there is that the writer can ease up on themselves about that because that was also beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwfun003h3b7569ug6zep@published"&gt;In the meantime, the writer wants to know about reconnecting through sex. But they have so much going on that getting to the sex part feels a little bit less of a priority here. They need to focus on rebuilding the relationship and working through it, because I’m not convinced that part is done. The writer acknowledges that to a certain degree by saying, “I’m waiting for the therapist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwhpe003m3b75czyalhmv@published"&gt;We’re not sidestepping the sexual question. You just have to get this stuff straight before you can actually approach that element of your relationship. Sure, some people can go through a crisis and remain sexually connected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwkx3003r3b75fe7i15r9@published"&gt;But in a lot of cases, that doesn’t happen. This is a case, too, where you have to renovate the house before you can sleep in the bedroom. You can’t just beeline there. So I think, number one, this is a matter of time. This is something that needs to be worked through, and you just have to allow yourself to re-acclimate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwomr003w3b75v6mdymdw@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;I completely agree. And to belabor the renovation metaphor: Let’s say that before the demolition, the writer always slept on the left side of the bed, and the girlfriend always slept on the right side of the bed. That doesn’t have to be how you arrange yourselves in the bed right now or moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwquo00413b75gzx28t4q@published"&gt;So under all of the guilt, and medical/psychological layers of this question is a really simple one: “I can’t get an erection because X, how do I have sex?” The simple response is, ask yourself what you and your partner get out of physical intimacy. Even though I know it’s difficult, try to set aside the usual scripts for a penis needing to be hard and used for penetration. Come at it from a fresh perspective. Ask yourself: How can I, with my body, give and receive what is important about intimacy as my body is now?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwsnm00463b75ojl3noi1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t be afraid to rely on external help, like a cock ring or a PDE5 inhibitor. Even if you are situationally experiencing erectile dysfunction, there’s a lot of anxiety that comes with that. These pills can help alleviate that anxiety, which can help you get an erection. So rely on the help that’s out there in this period, when you do sort out where you’re at sexually.&lt;br&gt;It seems to me like couples therapy could help, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwuad004b3b751nek1zxa@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; If infinite resources are possible, I would say, go for the individual therapy, couples therapy on top of that, and maybe also see someone who specializes in sexuality. However, given that the writer is waiting for a therapist who is covered by insurance, that indicates to me that the resources might be scarce. In which case, my instincts say that the writer, working through all of the guilt that they have in this situation, and the harm they experienced going through all of the events that led to now, is going to be the keystone of working through all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrww6l004g3b75oln9mbm0@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;So again, just to underscore, be forgiving to yourself. Even if you did things that you regret, you are not those things. Understand that this is a process, and work through it. That’s what you have to do now. You can’t change the past, but you can modify what you do now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcdrwxym004l3b75ewyuf9us@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;It’ll be really useful for the writer and the relationship to understand for themselves and the girlfriend what the point of having sex at this time is. What is the aim, the &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;motivation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About a third of those 20 and older consumed fast food on a given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Long Island health professionals said they are skeptical of the results as obesity &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/obesity-survey-fuetuow4" target="_blank"&gt;remains an epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not seeing it," said Dr. Lori Berman, a pediatrician at Allied Pediatrics in Valley Stream. "What I’m finding as a trend in my patients is that children mimic [their] parents’ eating habits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caloric intake from fast food&lt;/strong&gt; among American adults has decreased from 14.1% to 11.7% between 2013-14 and 2021-23, with variations by age group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While some Long Island food nutrition experts &lt;/strong&gt;said they're not seeing less fast food consumption, others credited social media with making healthy eating more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some families have moved from fast food&lt;/strong&gt; to ultra-processed or convenience foods, but these alternatives offer little to no advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, she said, are "basically pleasing their children" with fast food. She also said that limited budgets and busy lifestyles make fast food even more alluring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report, from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, didn't draw any conclusions about the decrease. But researchers noted fast food consumption "has been associated with an increased intake of calories, fat, sodium, and sugar, and with a lower intake of fiber, calcium, iron, fruits, dairy, whole grains, nuts, and seeds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not address the impacts of a wave of injectable diet drugs like Ozempic sweeping the country, causing a growing number of adults to dramatically reduce calorie consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some Long Island food nutrition experts said they're not seeing less fast food consumption, others credited social media with making healthy eating more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alyssa Morando, a registered dietitian at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson Station, said she believes that young adults view healthy eating as "trendy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids, young adults, teens, they love trends. They go on social media, they see they have these healthier sodas," Morando said. &lt;a href="https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/what-is-prebiotic-soda-and-is-it-good-for-you/" target="_blank"&gt;Prebiotic soda brands&lt;/a&gt; such as Olipop and Poppi together have over 1.2 million followers on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morando encourages discussing the benefits of eating a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables and lean proteins, and watching portion sizes of fast food, as opposed to eliminating it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study mirror a decline in sales reported by fast food giants like McDonald's. The company's sales dropped in the beginning of the year, marking the second consecutive quarter of declines, according to its latest earnings report. Same-store sales dropped 3.6%, the biggest drop since the COVID pandemic lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their part, McDonald's leaders are blaming the decline on economic conditions, not consumers seeking alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty," McDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement, adding that he has "confidence in our ability to navigate even the toughest of market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domino's Pizza and Burger King have reported similar earnings slumps, as has the fast-casual chain Chipotle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleopatra Tsanis-Tsirnikas, a dietitian at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream hospital, said she found that while individuals may be moving away from fast food, they may not be consuming significantly healthier alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There’s some people that will shift to more homemade things, which tend to be a good thing because they’re less processed," she said. "But people who are struggling economically will turn to more convenience foods that are more ultra-processed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsanis-Tsirnikas said, however, that options for food-insecure individuals are becoming more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody’s financially unable to get meals or fresh produce, there are programs out there," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Food pantries are becoming a more welcoming place without stigma, where it’s set up more like a supermarket so people can come in and feel comfortable as if they’re shopping for food instead of getting it for free, because there’s a stigma with that," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC survey also found older age groups took in a lower percentage of calories from fast food. Adults 20-39 consumed 15.2% of calories from fast food on a given day, while the figures were 11.9% for those 40-59 and 7.6% for people 60 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate CDC study found that the average percentage of calories consumed from fast food decreased significantly among 2- to 11-year-olds between 2013-14 and August 2021-August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside a Commack Whole Foods store on Wednesday, shoppers expressed discontent with fast food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try not to [eat fast food], as much as possible," said Joann Lawrence, 52, from Valley Stream. "I think it’s less healthy now. Cheap prices equals cheap food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Shapiro, 44 of Commack, doesn’t eat fast food.

Participants who achieved N2 sleep were far more likely to discover a hidden shortcut in a task after napping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG data showed that a steeper spectral slope during sleep—indicative of deeper rest—was associated with these moments of insight. The findings offer the first neural clues into why brief sleep might help the brain make unseen connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N2 Sleep Boosts Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; 85.7% of participants who reached N2 sleep had a breakthrough post-nap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainwave Clue:&lt;/strong&gt; A steeper EEG spectral slope during sleep was tied to improved problem-solving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nap vs. Wakefulness:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who stayed awake were significantly less likely to gain insight (55.5%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sleeping on it,” especially dropping deeper than a doze, might help people gain insight into certain kinds of tasks, according to a study published June 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Anika Löwe, Marit Petzka, Maria Tzegka and Nicolas Schuck from the Universität Hamburg, Germany, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans sometimes find that they have a sudden “eureka” moment on a problem they’ve been working on, producing sudden insight or breakthroughs. Scientists have yet to have their own “aha” moment of insight on how it might work, though sleep appears to play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how sleep might lead to insight while problem-solving, the authors of this pre-registered study asked 90 people to track a series of dots across a screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were given instructions about a seemingly simple task that merely involved responding to the dots on a keyboard, but the instructions left out a trick that could make the task easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four sets of trials, the subjects were put down for a 20-minute nap, hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG) to track their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their nap, the subjects were tested again, and 70.6 percent of participants had their “aha” moment, figuring out the unmentioned trick that made the task easier. All groups improved after their rest period, but 85.7 percent of those who achieved the first deeper sleep phase—called N2 sleep—had their breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, 55.5 percent of those who stayed awake and 63.6 of those who dropped into light, N1 sleep experienced a moment of insight. Studies of the EEG patterns showed that a steeper spectral slope, associated with deeper sleep, was also associated with an “aha” moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study did not compare people who rested or napped to those who didn’t get a break, a previous study by the authors that used the same task (but did not give participants a chance to nap) found 49.6% experienced “aha” moments. Thus, the authors suggest that a nap with deeper, N2 sleep might help someone who needs a moment of insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coauthor Nicolas Schuck notes, “It’s really intriguing that a short period of sleep can help humans make connections they didn’t see before. The next big question is why this happens. We hope that our discovery that it may be linked to the EEG spectral slope is a good first lead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anika Löwe says, “The EEG spectral slope has only recently been considered as a factor in cognitive processes during sleep. I find the link between the spectral slope steepness during sleep, aha-moments after sleep and the down regulation of weights – which we identified as crucial for aha-moments in our previous computational work – very exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Löwe adds, “I think a lot of us have made the subjective experience of having important realizations after a short nap. It’s really nice to not only have data on that, but also a first direction of what processes are behind this phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Löwe concludes, “What really struck me when telling people in my environment – particularly creatives – about these findings was how much they resonated with people. Many of them could relate to our results with a personal experience of having a (creative) breakthrough after a nap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;ATL is supported by the International Max Planck Research School on Computational Methods in Psychiatry and Ageing Research (IMPRS COMP2PSYCH, www.mps.ucl-centre.mpg.de).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NWS was funded by the Federal Government of Germany and the State of Hamburg as part of the Excellence Initiative, a Starting Grant from the European Union (ERC-StG-REPLAY-852669), and an Independent Max Planck Research Group grant awarded by the Max Planck Society (M.TN.A.BILD0004).

Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 19:53:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBoWkg0MzVVZXdRVmIwbFRWWURSXzhKSkZLZHNzZjBfd3JmZGZ0SUpsRjB3RFk3bFJhcHdsaVBsZ1BBX0ktLUUwc3dKMVdSQXhZb1R3djlWMEs1b0x3ZDYtdm96al94UFE2azNxVmY0U3ZaQ1BCeHc</guid></item><item><title>与数百种疾病和死亡有关的Ozempic型药物-未来主义 | Ozempic-Style Drugs Linked To Hundreds of Illnesses and Deaths - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFB2cGVHbkhPaVluOVEza1lXdjhkR25LaUZtVmJ6ell4S0dkQXJpUDlVZ0dqVTYtWHc1QmxsYmtrQTNOTW1vOGNlS0FZR2hIT1l1NHhJdjZQQWJWTmdoS2VlUTZabDdWdkVWSjVmSw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom's health regulator is investigating weight loss jabs like Ozempic and Mounjaro after linking it to hundreds of severe illnesses and even a handful of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/weight-loss-jabs-mounjaro-ozempic-wegovy-pancreatitis-b2776708.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; reports,&lt;/a&gt; the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is asking residents to submit their own experiences with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor/agonist drugs after the release of new data linking them to nearly 300 cases of pancreatitis and at least 10 pancreatitis-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the month, the pharmacy news site &lt;a href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/clinical/exclusive-over-100-uk-deaths-now-linked-to-glp-1-ras-N23DYU55NBEFNIRBJLO4YEEYLA/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chemists and Druggists&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a whopping 111 people in the UK had died after taking GLP-1 drugs, though as the government noted, those figures do "not necessarily mean that [a death] was caused by the medicine" and that the fatalities could have been caused by underlying conditions. Instead, it appears that the authorities who reported those deaths to the health regulator suspected that the drug played a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those 111 deaths, at least 10 were related to pancreatitis. UK outlets are now reporting on them thanks to the government's new push for residents to flag any pancreas issues after taking GLP-1s to the MHRA's "&lt;a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Yellow Card&lt;/a&gt;" campaign, which urges residents to report adverse drug events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official warnings about this potential link between GLP-1s and pancreatitis also comes just days after the country's National Health Service began allowing doctors offices to &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/prevention/obesity/medicines-for-obesity/weight-management-injections/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;prescribe Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, the Eli Lilly weight loss jab that uses the drug tirzepatide, a compound similar to the one underlying Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the NHS notes, general practitioners in the UK will only be able to prescribe Mounjaro based on a very selective list of eligibility criteria that includes being diagnosed with at least four obesity-related illnesses and, strangely, having a body mass index (BMI) rating that's adjustable based on race or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors maintain that GLP-1s are safe for most people to take, some have begun to voice caution based on real-world data like those recently released by the MHRA — especially because an &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/britons-weight-loss-jabs-pharmacies-step-up-3672432?srsltid=AfmBOorc6wGqgEScFNbU-ZOpoe8ojyy9cQeyyj84fcnNQ2Op47iQWnyn" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;estimated 1.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the UK are now taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The percentages for pancreatitis seen in clinical trials was small, but we know that many people are now purchasing these medications privately," explained Simon Cork, a physiology teacher at Anglia Ruskin University, in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Indy&lt;/em&gt;. "Small percentages in large numbers means an increasing number of people developing these conditions, although they still remain rare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MHRA's new guidance is meant more to help doctors and patients decide what is best rather than to sow panic, Cork insisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the vast majority of people, these drugs will help with weight loss and are overwhelmingly safe," he continued. "For a small number of people, significant side effects will occur, and it’s important to ensure that people are being monitored by their healthcare professionals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on Ozempic:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/doctors-concerned-teens-ozempic" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctors Concerned By Massive Uptick In Teens Taking Ozempic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 19:19:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFB2cGVHbkhPaVluOVEza1lXdjhkR25LaUZtVmJ6ell4S0dkQXJpUDlVZ0dqVTYtWHc1QmxsYmtrQTNOTW1vOGNlS0FZR2hIT1l1NHhJdjZQQWJWTmdoS2VlUTZabDdWdkVWSjVmSw</guid></item><item><title>由营养师创建的7天无糖高纤维膳食计划- EatingWell | 7-Day No-Sugar High-Fiber Meal Plan for Insulin Resistance, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOMHhjQkZJQXREbEF1NTB5NlFzTWF6N0dpOFNON3pTc2g5YWZSNlJGZ0QtZnczTTJxMkpMdExTaGk4T01xQldXSFN6LW1TckN4VkkxOW8tamlMVE5qX3diRlU2b0RmcUJRaVRyaTFTWjRtS0xaMXlDUVRRazZQaC1iZzdrcXF3WDZydWU1LXgwQU9OWmJEc2NoX2R3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 295 to 390 calories, while the lunches span 357 to 413 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it's unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What causes insulin resistance?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin is a hormone released by the pancreas when blood sugar levels rise, a natural response that occurs when food is broken down into the simplest form of sugar called glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things are working smoothly, insulin helps move blood sugars into the cells for energy, which returns circulating blood sugar to normal baseline levels. Over time, the body can develop a tolerance to insulin, meaning the blood sugars don't respond as well despite the body pumping out high insulin levels, which results in elevated blood sugar levels&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there isn't a singular cause of insulin resistance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites factors that can increase risk, including a family history of type 2 diabetes, lack of physical activity and obesity&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; are so prevalent in food and many people consume more than they realize, we opted to exclude them from this plan. Instead, we focus on nutrients that are shown to improve blood sugars—like fiber and protein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_157-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-improve-insulin-resistance"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_158-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Improve Insulin Resistance &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_159-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, including protecting the heart and promoting a healthy gut. Additionally, it helps stabilize blood sugar levels and keeps you full for longer by slowing down digestion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Frequently: &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend physical activity as one of the most important and beneficial steps for improving insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Regular Meals:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating regular meals and snacks, ideally with a good source of fiber and protein, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076471/habit-to-start-for-better-blood-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;helps promote stable blood sugars&lt;/a&gt; and eating too much. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boost Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to helping you build muscle and other body functions, protein also slows down digestion and improves satiety. Pairing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001055/best-proteins-to-eat-for-diabetes-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; with those higher in carbohydrates helps temper the blood sugar response and stabilize levels. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Added Sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Though added sugar can be included in moderation, stick to the American Heart Association's recommended daily max of 9 teaspoons of added sugar for men and 6 for women. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Jeremy Didier had taken her son to a psychologist for a possible ADHD evaluation when she spotted an article about women with the condition. As she read it in the waiting room, she thought to herself: They’re describing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lots of risk-taking, lots of very impulsive behavior growing up,” Didier said. As the magazine described, she’d excelled in school but gotten in trouble for talking too much. She’d amassed too many speeding tickets as an adult. She turned to her husband and said, “I think I might have ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didier is now the board president of Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a nonprofit advocacy and support organization. Her realization mirrors the experiences of other adults who wonder if they have ADHD after a child’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity or a combination of the two. Common symptoms such as trouble concentrating or sitting still can create challenges at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with ADHD are often passed over for promotions, said Andrew Sylvester, a psychiatrist at UCHealth, a hospital in Longmont, Colorado. Difficulties with attention may lead the mind to drift during meetings, and cause someone to miss important discussion nuances. The disorder may interfere with organization, planning and remembering details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet some adults think of having ADHD as a source of personality strengths and ways of thinking that benefit employers. Diagnostic manuals may call it a disorder, but it also can be a superpower, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our brains work differently and so we’re more likely to be able to think outside the box and come up with different things, and sometimes that’s because we’ve had to do that in order to to survive,” Didier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to cope with and channel ADHD in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding community&lt;br&gt;
Getting diagnosed with ADHD doesn’t always lead to a quick fix. While doctors often recommend medication and therapy, not everyone can take medication, and those routes don’t necessarily eliminate all symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didier floundered with a messy house and lots of yelling as she and four of her five children were diagnosed with ADHD. She experimented with medicine, diets and reward charts, and discovered what helped her the most: a community of parents who had children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing like talking to other people who are going through what you’re going through to help you feel … that you’re not alone,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didier eventually became a social worker and now runs support groups for adults with ADHD, teaching skills they can use at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organizations have employee resource groups organized around neurodiversity to provide camaraderie and support to adults with ADHD, autism, dyslexia and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS of the brain&lt;br&gt;
People with ADHD often struggle with executive function, which Didier describes as “your brain’s GPS” for navigating your day. Executive function is a set of mental skills that includes making plans, managing time and flexible thinking. It also includes working memory, which helps us keep track of what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep from getting derailed, experts recommend breaking large tasks into chunks, writing detailed to-do lists and taking breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal chef Bill Collins, 66, who was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, writes structured lists when he’s making a meal for a client. He creates categories for kitchen areas — counter, stove and oven — and then lists tasks such as “chop carrots, boil water for pasta” underneath each category. Then he numbers each task so he knows exactly what to do, where and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s how I got around my unknown ADHD early on, just making lists,” Collins said. “If it’s something I don’t want to do, I put it at the top of the list so I can be done with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another technique is called “body doubling,” which involves a pair of work colleagues meeting over Zoom or in-person to focus on completing projects. The two may choose to perform separate tasks — one might build a presentation deck while the other files tax reports — but help each other stay accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re just sitting there during that dedicated time, getting things done,” Didier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance company Liberty Mutual provides an AI tool that helps break down large projects into manageable tasks and provides reminders about deadlines, to help employees with ADHD stay focused and organized, said Head of Benefits Verlinda DiMarino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting through meetings&lt;br&gt;
Meetings can be difficult for people with ADHD if their minds drift or they feel an urge to get up out of a chair. They also may struggle with impulse control and find it hard to wait their turn to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Clark, CEO of the Adult and Pediatric Institute, a mental health practice in Stuart, Florida, suggests asking for meeting topics in advance and writing up talking points. If you think of questions during the meeting, write them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employers use a voice-to-text service, projecting what a speaker is saying on a screen, which helps people with attention difficulties stay focused, Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvester, the psychiatrist, recommends practicing active listening by repeating in your head what someone just said, or taking a brief time-out from a meeting to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell them, “’I need five minutes. I’ll be right back.’ Get up and walk out. Do what you need to do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariel Paralitici-Morales, chief medical officer of the Adult and Pediatric Institute, who has ADHD, sits close to whoever will be speaking to help sustain attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having something in my hand helps,” said Paralitici-Morales, who sometimes holds a fidget spinner. “If we have to talk, I found it’s easier for me to be the first one and break the ice” to keep herself from second-guessing what she planned to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek accommodations&lt;br&gt;
People with an ADHD diagnosis can request accommodations at work through the Americans with Disabilities Act. Noise-canceling headphones may help. Consider asking for the ability to take a break every 20 minutes, Sylvester said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Set a timer for five to 10 minutes. Get up and walk around. Make some coffee. Go play with the dog,” he said. “When that timer goes off, go back to a 15 to 20 minute hard productivity cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees can also request a flexible schedule or ability to work from home, which can enable time for therapy or self-care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoinette Damico, 23, who coordinates events at an executive search firm in San Francisco, said she practices meditation, writes daily goals in a journal and stays off short-form media to improve her concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrate your strengths&lt;br&gt;
Having ADHD can be an asset in the workplace, and many CEOs and entrepreneurs are neurodiverse, Didier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We bring all kinds of unique talents to our workplaces. Hyper-focus, lots of energy, resilience, the ability to multitask,” she added. “There’s something about people with ADHD that seems to unmask or give us a greater capacity for creativity and innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damico also thinks her ADHD provides some advantages. When she’s interested in a topic, she can be extremely focused, reading extensively and talking about the topic nonstop, a trait others with ADHD report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can generate a real passion in you that is a bit unique,” she said. “It really creates this grit in me in terms of when I really want to accomplish something, there’s this boost of energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

Of the two new patients, one lives in Utah County and the other lives in the southwest area of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;None of the five people with confirmed infections so far has been vaccinated, according to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two of the patients so far have been pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“Women who become infected with measles during their pregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems,” the department said Thursday. “A pregnant woman is also much more likely to be hospitalized because of severe measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen, the department expected the two new infections because it knew the individuals were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;She said it’s “quite concerning” that two of the individuals infected have needed hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We expect we will see additional cases,” she said, based on the department’s knowledge of who has been exposed, and added the department believes there are unidentified infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Though she said 90% of Utahns are vaccinated and protected, even those who have received a vaccine can become infected, though she said the case is typically more mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those who remain unvaccinated should consider the risks and speak to their doctors, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In southern Utah, she said there are areas where disproportionately high amounts of people are unvaccinated compared with the rest of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;On Thursday, the department&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommended that people planning to become pregnant get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and their baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles if a person receives two doses, the state agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, two of the people diagnosed with measles were hospitalized because of complications. Both have since been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear one to two weeks after someone is exposed to the virus, according to DHHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;They can include a fever over 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, a cough, a runny nose and red eyes. After four feverish days, people generally develop a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said the rash typically starts at the hairline before spreading across their face and to their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;State health officials urge people who have been exposed and people who develop symptoms to stay away from others and call health care providers before visiting a clinic or hospital.

We are the doctors you trust with your health and the health of your family across every stage of life, from the first checkups in infancy and childhood, to health care during pregnancy and adulthood, through management of chronic illness and aging. We are family physicians, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, OB-GYNs, and infectious disease experts. Our commitment is not to politics, but to the absolute well-being of our patients and populations, and to providing them with best evidence-based health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have an urgent, united message: Immunizations work, they are very effective and safe, and they save lives. Vaccines are among the most rigorously studied and effective tools in public health. Through widespread immunization, we have eradicated debilitating and fatal diseases that once caused serious illness, hospitalization, and death for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But today, that legacy is at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misinformation, politicization of commonsense public health efforts, and sudden changes to federal vaccine guidance is creating mass confusion and diminishing trust in public health. As we head into another fall season sure to be marked by cases of flu, Covid-19, and RSV as well as the alarming reappearance of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/24/us-measles-elimination-status-vaccine-rates-cdc-mmr-rate/"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and pertussis, the stakes could not be higher. These respiratory illnesses are not abstract threats. They are &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/10/what-it-is-like-to-have-measles-rubella-polio-pertussis-first-person-patient-stories/"&gt;real and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, particularly to infants, seniors, pregnant patients and those with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are the trusted physicians in the room when a parent hears that their child has pneumonia from RSV or pertussis. When a pregnant patient is hospitalized with preventable Covid-19 and influenza complications. When an older adult arrives in the ER with flu or RSV that could have been avoided. These are your parents, grandparents, infants, children, neighbors, and loved ones. They are you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are the people we care for every single day.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In moments of uncertainty, the role of trusted physicians becomes even more vital. Patients look to us for facts, based on our medical training and a review of the best available scientific evidence. They rely on our expertise to navigate conflicting messages, social media, and politicized headlines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So let us be clear: Our organizations will strongly continue recommending vaccines. We will keep having conversations with patients and families across exam rooms, schools, and communities about what’s safe and what’s necessary to stay healthy and create populations of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also call on our health system partners, including insurers, hospitals, pharmacies, and public health agencies, to do their part. Vaccines must remain available, accessible, and affordable to persons of all ages. Any barrier to immunization is a significant threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen what happens when that access is compromised. When immunization rates drop, significant outbreaks return. History has shown us that when trust in science falters, preventable disease rapidly spreads and people suffer needlessly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why we will not stay silent. We will continue to speak the truth to policymakers. We will continue to have compassionate, honest conversations with families making health care decisions, and provide accurate, scientifically sound information to populations navigating swirling eddies of mis- and disinformation. Our role is not just to provide care, but to lead. Many of our organizations are working together to ensure our patients and our members have trusted guidance in the absence of reliable information.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;We need strong, scientific, evidence-based public health leadership to guide this country forward. Because immunizations do more than protect individuals. When everyone in a community can be vaccinated, we can keep kids in school, workers on the job, hospital beds available, and terrible diseases from taking lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We cannot and will not gamble with our patients’ health or the health of our communities. We must lean into what we, as medical physicians and experts, know works, based on decades of evidence. It’s a time for clarity, consistency, and courage. And it’s a time for every health care leader to stand firmly in support of the science and vaccines that save lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re not going anywhere. And we won’t stop fighting for what’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newly discovered species of sea worm, aptly named &lt;em&gt;Pectinereis strickrotti&lt;/em&gt;, has left scientists in awe due to its unique movement, which has been described as resembling a “&lt;strong&gt;living magic carpet&lt;/strong&gt;.” This mysterious creature was first spotted in 2009, but it wasn’t until a decade later that a dedicated research team returned to the deep waters off the coast of Costa Rica to further explore the animal’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Unique Creature Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located 30 miles off the coast of Costa Rica, &lt;a href="https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;amp;id=1741700&amp;amp;from=rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pectinereis strickrotti&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;was found inhabiting the methane seeps of the Pacific Ocean, a region teeming with unusual and poorly understood life forms. The worms liv&lt;strong&gt;e approximately 1,000 meters below the ocean surface,&lt;/strong&gt; a place where methane seeps create an extraordinary ecosystem. These seeps, which emit methane gas from deep within the Earth, support a wide variety of species that feed on bacteria that consume the methane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worms themselves are a type of ragworm and &lt;strong&gt;measure around 10 centimeters in length&lt;/strong&gt;. Their most distinguishing feature is their parapodia, which resemble feathers and add to their graceful, almost ethereal movement through the water. The way the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/they-found-worms-in-40-year-old-canned-salmon-but-its-great-news/" data-type="post" data-id="82865"&gt;worms&lt;/a&gt; glide across the ocean floor has fascinated researchers, with lead pilot Bruce Strickrott, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, describing it as “a living magic carpet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Exploring Methane Seeps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been exploring methane seeps in the region since 2009, and this latest discovery of &lt;em&gt;Pectinereis strickrotti&lt;/em&gt; is part of a broader effort to understand the biodiversity of deep-sea ecosystems. These&lt;strong&gt; methane seeps&lt;/strong&gt; are home to numerous species that thrive in the absence of sunlight, relying instead on chemosynthesis—a process by which &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/nasa-accidentally-created-bacteria/" data-type="post" data-id="90641"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; convert methane and other chemicals into food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of &lt;em&gt;Pectinereis strickrotti&lt;/em&gt; adds to a growing list of new species found in these deep-sea habitats. Since 2009, scientists&lt;strong&gt; have identified 48 new species&lt;/strong&gt; in the methane seeps off the coast of Costa Rica, highlighting the rich, yet largely unexplored biodiversity of the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/first-ever-predator-found-8000-meters-deep-ocean/" data-type="post" data-id="88317"&gt;deep ocean&lt;/a&gt;. As marine biologist Greg Rouse from the University of California notes, “We’ve spent years trying to name and describe the biodiversity of the deep sea,” further emphasizing the importance of continued exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Graceful Movement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the 2019 expedition to the methane seeps, six of these &lt;strong&gt;new sea worms were observed&lt;/strong&gt;. Their motion, described by Strickrott as “graceful,” stood out to the researchers, who marveled at the effect they created while swimming. “The way this thing moved was so graceful, I thought it looked like a living magic carpet,” Strickrott said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/new-deep-sea-worm-discovered-methane-seep-costa-rica" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; study &lt;/a&gt;of these unique animals and their behavior provides vital insight into the ways life can adapt to extreme environments. The methane seeps, which are inhospitable to most forms of life due to their harsh conditions, provide an unlikely refuge for these resilient creatures. In the broader context of marine research, the discovery of &lt;em&gt;Pectinereis strickrotti&lt;/em&gt; underscores just how much of the ocean remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

When symptoms do occur, they often resemble those of the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-8c145050-529d-11f0-a483-01bc7c3d9340" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, and fatigue, as well as confusion, poor coordination and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because it typically mimics more benign conditions, the infection is often overlooked, but can be diagnosed via blood tests that look for antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The milder symptoms usually subside within a few weeks with the help of anti-parasitic medicines or antibiotics, but in individuals with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and infants, toxoplasmosis can cause more severe complications such as seizures and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, based on their research, the scientists &lt;span&gt;believe they have potentially found a way to detect T. gondii and treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alarming findings show that more than 100 million Americans have been infected with a parasite that silently eats away at the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered infected neurons in the brain release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs) — particles that play a role in communication between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Emma Wilson, professor of biomedical sciences, said: 'Our research opens the door to using EVs as biomarkers, which can be isolated from blood.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current diagnostic tools can only confirm if someone has been exposed to T. gondii by identifying antibodies, proteins produced by the body's immune system to fight foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, tests cannot detect if the parasite is still active in the brain or how it might be impacting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wilson and her team are now conducting further research to better understand how the parasite operates in a bid to develop new therapies to clear the parasite or even vaccines in the future to protect against it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, T. gondii can lead to toxoplasmosis, which causes flu-like symptoms that can go largely unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who ingest the parasite in early pregnancy can suffer a miscarriage or stillbirth, according to studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most infections go away without treatment but medication is available for those who are more at risk of serious complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers behind the most recent study say that there is 'no need to avoid someone who is infected [and] most people live their entire lives without symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are signs it could be linked to brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest patients infected with T. gondii were almost 50 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with schizophrenia than those without, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The parasite, which can lie dormant in the brain for decades, is typically contracted through undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Offering advice in terms of avoiding infection, researchers behind the new paper added: 'The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Heart attacks are no longer the leading cause of death from heart disease. (Carlos_Pascual/Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heart attack deaths have dropped by 89% since 1970, thanks to major medical advances, public health efforts, and better emergency care.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other heart conditions like heart failure, arrhythmias, and high blood pressure-related disease have sharply increased, now accounting for nearly half of all heart disease deaths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;As Americans live longer, surviving heart attacks often leads to chronic heart problems, highlighting the growing need to manage long-term cardiovascular health, not just prevent heart attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STANFORD, Calif. — &lt;/strong&gt;Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by an astounding 89% since 1970, even after accounting for the aging population. However, Americans are now dying from completely different heart problems at alarming rates. A new study from Stanford University reveals that the nature of heart disease mortality has transformed over the past five decades, with conditions like heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and high blood pressure-related heart disease now killing far more people than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 1970, when your grandparents were young adults, 91% of all heart disease deaths came from what doctors call “ischemic” heart disease. This includes heart attacks and related conditions caused by blocked arteries. Fast-forward to 2022, and that number has dropped to just 53%. Meanwhile, deaths from other heart conditions have skyrocketed by 81% overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed over 37 million heart disease deaths spanning more than half a century. Researchers discovered that acute &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/social-isolation-increases-risk-of-heart-attack-stroke-death-from-all-causes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attack deaths&lt;/a&gt; fell from 354 per 100,000 people in 1970 to just 40 per 100,000 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-heart-attack-deaths-plummeted"&gt;Why Heart Attack Deaths Plummeted&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1960s, a cascade of medical breakthroughs began saving &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/heart-attack-panic-attack-why-young-men-calling-ambulances-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attack victims&lt;/a&gt;. Emergency responders learned CPR, hospitals created specialized cardiac care units, and doctors developed techniques to open blocked arteries. The 1970s brought coronary angiography (mapping the heart’s blood vessels), followed by balloon angioplasty in 1977, which could physically open blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1980s and 1990s saw the introduction of clot-busting drugs, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/aspirin-heart-attack-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aspirin therapy&lt;/a&gt;, coronary stents, and powerful cholesterol-lowering medications called statins. Each advancement chipped away at heart attack mortality rates. By the 2000s, doctors had established the critical “door-to-balloon” protocols that ensure heart attack patients get life-saving treatment within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, public health campaigns were transforming American behavior. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Smoking rates&lt;/a&gt; plummeted from about 40% in 1970 to 14% in 2019, thanks to everything from the landmark 1964 Surgeon General’s report linking cigarettes to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; to smoke-free policies and tobacco taxes. Doctors also got more aggressive about treating high &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, with treatment guidelines becoming increasingly strict over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unintended-consequences-of-success"&gt;The Unintended Consequences of Success&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deaths from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; increased by 146%, deaths from high blood pressure-related heart disease jumped 106%, and deaths from dangerous heart rhythm problems exploded by a staggering 450%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; increased from 70.9 years in 1970 to 77.5 years in 2022. As more Americans survived their initial cardiac events and lived longer overall, they accumulated more time for other &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; to develop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1970, if you had a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/heatwaves-pollution-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;massive heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, you probably died. Today, thanks to many advances in medicine, you’ll likely survive that heart attack. But you might spend the next 20 years dealing with a weakened heart that eventually develops heart failure or dangerous rhythm problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-health-challenges-add-fuel-to-the-fire"&gt;Modern Health Challenges Add Fuel to the Fire&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rising rates of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; haven’t helped. Obesity rates have nearly tripled since the 1970s, jumping from 15% to 40% of the adult population. Diabetes now affects an estimated 50% of American adults, when you include pre-diabetes. These conditions are also major drivers of heart failure and other &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also point to improved &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ai-test-diagnoses-arthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnostic capabilities&lt;/a&gt; as a factor. Doctors today are much better at identifying conditions like heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (where the heart squeezes normally but doesn’t fill properly) and pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every life saved from a heart attack is a victory, but many of those survivors will eventually face years of living with weakened hearts, requiring ongoing medical care, and ultimately dying from complications like heart failure or dangerous heart rhythms. Today, the keys to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/gums-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maintaining heart health&lt;/a&gt; throughout a longer lifespan include managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure that contribute to various forms of heart disease, and recognizing that surviving a cardiac event is just the beginning of a longer journey with heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System covering all U.S. adults aged 25 and older from 1970 through 2022. They examined over 37 million heart disease deaths, representing 31% of all deaths during this period. The team used International Classification of Diseases codes to categorize different types of heart disease across multiple coding system revisions. They calculated both absolute numbers of deaths and age-adjusted mortality rates (standardized to account for population aging) and used statistical software to identify trends and percentage changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall heart disease mortality decreased by 66% from 1970 to 2022. Acute heart attack deaths plummeted 89%, while all ischemic heart disease deaths fell 81%. However, deaths from other heart conditions increased 81% overall, with heart failure up 146%, hypertensive heart disease up 106%, and arrhythmias up 450%. The proportion of heart disease deaths caused by ischemic conditions dropped from 91% in 1970 to 53% in 2022. Within ischemic heart disease, acute heart attacks declined from 54% of deaths in 1970 to 29% in 2022, while chronic ischemic heart disease increased from 46% to 71%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on death certificates, which can contain coding errors and inconsistencies, particularly when disease classification systems changed over the decades. Some conditions like heart failure and arrhythmias may have underlying ischemic causes that current coding systems cannot precisely identify, potentially underestimating the true burden of ischemic heart disease. The researchers used “underlying cause of death” rather than “multiple cause of death,” which may underestimate how much each condition contributes to mortality. The study also didn’t analyze differences by age, sex, race, ethnicity, or geographic region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several authors reported funding from the National Institutes of Health, including the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and the Doris Duke Foundation. Some authors disclosed consulting relationships with various pharmaceutical companies, though no conflicts of interest were noted that would affect the study’s conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

Many people are craving that calming sensation, given the constant barrage of stressful news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIG2AVGTQJHRRKG7EQGZBFQHCY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Often called the “love hormone” or the “cuddle hormone,” oxytocin is produced in the brain’s hypothalamus and acts as a chemical messenger. It promotes feelings of love, bonding and well-being. It also impacts the peripheral nervous system, which carries information from the brain to the rest of the body, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/alicia-che/" target="_blank"&gt;Alicia Che&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine who conducts research on oxytocin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YRVBBLDD6NCVPHDPD5CVJUD7SM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a result, the hormone can influence sensory processing, pain perception, regulation of body temperature, social interactions and more. “Oxytocin works in the brain &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; body,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OUFWAWODDJFKDFTORWFGUO2J5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet, it’s sometimes misunderstood. Due to its roles in childbirth and breastfeeding (it’s responsible for milk letdown and the emotional bonding between mom and newborn), “oxytocin had a reputation as a female hormone,” said &lt;a href="https://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/sue-carter" target="_blank"&gt;Sue Carter&lt;/a&gt;, a neurobiologist and distinguished research scientist at Indiana University and the University of Virginia. “It’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YGNZUUS2ZVGGXMDMYX6Z5RUX2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both men and women have oxytocin, as well as receptors for the hormone throughout their brains and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DGPBPASTCJCVDAAWGI6YZPPTQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Oxytocin is nature’s medicine because it affects every known process, even the microbiome,” Carter said. “It’s everywhere, doing everything.

Even&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5718605/" target="_blank"&gt; listening to relaxing, slow-tempo music&lt;/a&gt; is associated with increased salivary oxytocin levels, research has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5UUOAEBMIFC6RMXTSIHS2VNKH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engage in a meditative practice:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32227624/" target="_blank"&gt; Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that a single session of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/23/mindfulness-meditation-anxiety-medication/" target="_blank"&gt;mindfulness meditation&lt;/a&gt; is associated with increased salivary levels of oxytocin. Other research has found that compassion-based and loving-kindness meditation can promote the release of oxytocin, most likely by promoting a sense of well-being and social connection, Che said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTLULPESTNHYFLBMHIR2XEHDPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do something kind for someone else:&lt;/b&gt; Whether you volunteer at a charitable organization, a school or senior center, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/28/altruism-volunteering-donating-wellbeing/" target="_blank"&gt;being of service to other people&lt;/a&gt; — called prosocial behavior — is associated with an increased production of oxytocin, according to a 2022 study. Oxytocin has strong connections with reward pathways in the brain, and altruistic acts can stimulate them “and give you a warm and fuzzy feeling,” Che said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBC3EBEEYNDS5NKSYXTP3QRABQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get the right touch: &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34559691/" target="_blank"&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23251939/" target="_blank"&gt;moderate-pressure&lt;/a&gt; massage, on your back, head or feet, can lead to higher levels of &lt;a href="https://id.elsevier.com/as/authorization.oauth2?platSite=SD%2Fscience&amp;amp;additionalPlatSites=GH%2Fgeneralhospital%2CMDY%2Fmendeley%2CSC%2Fscopus%2CRX%2Freaxys&amp;amp;scope=openid%20email%20profile%20els_auth_info%20els_idp_info%20els_idp_analytics_attrs%20urn%3Acom%3Aelsevier%3Aidp%3Apolicy%3Aproduct%3Ainst_assoc&amp;amp;response_type=code&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fuser%2Fidentity%2Flanding&amp;amp;authType=SINGLE_SIGN_IN&amp;amp;prompt=none&amp;amp;client_id=SDFE-v4&amp;amp;state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3D8b248df7-3ca4-4eb9-8553-e65ac0eabab2%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fabs%252Fpii%252FS0306453018308370%26prompt%3Dnone%26cid%3Darp-6ecf3c15-fc7f-447c-8aba-1b5f7fb11ca8" target="_blank"&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; in your blood or saliva, studies have shown.

Petting your dog can stimulate the release of oxytocin, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z7DQ5BOXMZA6RBQZ3R4ZPX7WUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use good scents:&lt;/b&gt; Exposing yourself to certain aromas can up your oxytocin levels. Women’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32013535/" target="_blank"&gt;oxytocin levels increased&lt;/a&gt; after exposure to lavender, neroli, jasmine absolute, roman chamomile, clary sage and Indian sandalwood oils, one study showed. Interestingly, a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11196605/" target="_blank"&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that while women’s salivary oxytocin levels increased after exposure to lavender essential oil, men’s didn’t, leading researchers to speculate that this may be because the sense of smell is more sensitive in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NMCROUYJDRGRHLBCQLNIYAWUGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get moving: &lt;/b&gt;Whether you go for a jog or do&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6736948/" target="_blank"&gt; martial arts training&lt;/a&gt; or yoga, movement may stimulate production of oxytocin. When it comes to running, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053161/" target="_blank"&gt;the duration may matter&lt;/a&gt;: While 10 minutes of running leads to an increase in salivary oxytocin levels, the effects are even greater after a 30-minute run, according to one study&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;“You need some physiological arousal to induce the release of oxytocin,” Zak said.

There will always be a new study highlighting the benefits or risks of eating just about anything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Howard Tucker and his wife of 68 years Sara Siegel on their wedding day in 1957. The couple are very happy together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America's waistline has been ballooning for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, some 43 percent of Americans were considered obese, compared to just 13 percent in the 1960s, when Dr Tucker first graduated med school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also suggests that in the late 1970s, Americans got about six percent of their calories from fast food. Today, that has nearly doubled to 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research shows not only are Americans eating more, but the size and calorie content of store bought and fast food has surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 1986 and 2016, studies suggest that the average burger has gained 39 grams in weight and contains 90 more calories. It also now has 41.6 percent of the daily salt allowance, compared to 27.8 percent initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For fast food desserts, the average one now weighs an extra 71 grams and contains 186 more calories than it did four decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker, who is from Ohio, suggested in his interview that one of the ways to counteract this is to eat meals you cooked yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The grandfather-of-10, does allow himself the occasional treat — saying he is partial to ice cream and donuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But his treat drawer also includes, perhaps uniquely, pickles that he likes to make himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker indulges in the occasional martini too, having &lt;span&gt;not being scared off by the recent studies suggesting alcohol may raise someone's risk of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the neurologist is eager to stress that, like so much in life, 'moderation' is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To me, moderation seems to be correct,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People often suggest that eating X or strictly following Y routine will help you live longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't believe in extremes or fads. In fact, I think going to extremes can be more harmful than helpful. Certainly, genetics and luck play an enormous role. Beyond that, I believe the key is everything in moderation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker is pictured above with one of his snacks, pickles, which he likes to make himself by mixing brine with cucumbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker is also no stranger to exercise, even a month before his 103rd birthday, saying he still uses a treadmill in his home gym — although at a much slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also tries to jog when he can and walks a lot, saying this 'strengthens your heart and stimulates your brain'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It hasn't all been plain sailing with his health, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He injured his neck in a skiing accident at the age of 80 years, he said, which led his family to ban him from the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker also encourages people to continually seek knowledge and connection, saying this provides vital stimulation that keeps the brain active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When people ask me about longevity, as a real punkster, I would say: wine, women and song,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like his father, Dr Tucker has made sure to try and have friends at least a few decades younger than himself, saying this helps to stimulate him to think better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not all about pleasure and socializing, he believes in strengthening the brain through learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker completed a law degree at age 67 years in 1989, and still regularly reads neurology journals to stimulate his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He is still chasing new skills even now, having signed up for a computer course most recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker is pictured above at the 29th Annual Webby Awards in New York in May this year. He was named winner for the award 'Best of the Internet'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker has also won an award from the Guinness World Records book as the oldest practicing doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker also warns that people should never retire, blasting this as the 'enemy of longevity' because it reduces someone's decision-making and social interaction — which may hasten decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker stopped working in 2022 after the hospital where he worked closed, but said he would still be there if it was open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has applied for new jobs, but keeps getting rejected — which he says is likely because of his age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:53:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPUGRuY1lOdFo1dHhxOTJvZVBia0hoTHR5VGo2enE3eF8yMmVIb0hkNDFMR2xwV01uekJvQ1VYR1psaEQzVFdCMDhJU2hlazc5aHY2cjhvTy0xcVF1NHo5a291MkJHSDJ4X2llbnI3M3ZYaFZmc25yaWN5VHc0OUM3RUNqVUlRVnhvLTZaYzVWUld0bFMwaXZ4SWFmeDFyQ1lyVWxBdXZqTGFLR0hEM1VPMEs1Ty04Z2pv0gG-AUFVX3lxTE03R3k1Z0RmLVpNako4TE15TXVqVTNyMVNtcWF4MDhCbzkxS0dLVGZIaFQxTEZBdDkyN2ZuR1lkMm0wTWNsX0RVMGx5RDd5Q0JVM1JIOEpTOVRZNEwyUzhCdzh5NWY5RWwtR0hvR294eVcyMV9qSWNUUkgxejdKZEdRQnhuN19CbHlRV0dsSXVtbU84LTJEOTZCTDFVZUVVYmp3RkRJQy1YZXNURVJKSGI2V0ItSlh5cGlPZ1JXX0E</guid></item><item><title>根据研究，不能忍受听到别人咀嚼的人经常分享这5个特征- YourTango | People Who Can’t Stand Hearing Others Chew Often Share These 5 Traits, According To Research - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQSDVVUEhtQnhmNHR6eldfSXdFc0MtNzgtNWR6NW9wNU5QWWpNSDNNX3FnTUtQVFlBYlp4UEkxc3dodUYyeXhaR1NNd3NGaTRtWlQwa3EzY3FpZHNkVXdOamI3NllFanpsSFNfZzZjeTh5aEYyNEl6NDR2TkYxb3dmY2NGS200WHE3M2J1NG0wTi0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, it's nails on a chalkboard — either the literal kind or the figurative kind. For others, it's people humming. And for scores of us, it's that one most hated sound of all: the sound of someone else chewing. It's always annoying to have to listen to someone chomping on popcorn at the movies like it's their last meal, but misophonia, an actual disorder in which people have extreme reactions to unpleasant sounds, goes deeper than annoyance. It turns out there's a reason why, and it's related to our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with misophonia, those annoying sounds we all encounter now and then — slurping, snoring, tapping, even someone's breathing — can feel like they are slowly but surely driving us insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I cannot and will not abide a ticking clock. If I'm ever a guest in your home, just know that the batteries are coming out the minute I can get away with it because the sound drives me slowly insane. I have my great-grandmother's broken heirloom clock from Finland, and when my aunt demanded to know why I haven't fixed it, I gave her a simple answer: I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO IT. It can stay broken! Forever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the deal? Am I just a crank? Are people's disgusting lip-smacking and tongue noises when they chew just bad manners getting your goat? I mean, yes, they are (your parents should be jailed for not teaching you to chew with your mouth closed), but it turns out there's more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that those who self-report having misophonia were more likely to have genetic expressions associated with certain psychiatric disorders and certain neurological conditions. If you're ready to backhand anyone who eats an apple in your presence, you just might have one or more of the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. PTSD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.971752/full" rel="nofollow"&gt;2023 Dutch study&lt;/a&gt;, genetic analysis found a substantial correlation between those with genes that increase &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health/is-she-rude-or-ptsd"&gt;one's likelihood for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and misophonia. And intriguingly, this means that misophonia might actually be a treatable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/people-with-misophonia-hate-hearing-people-chew-share-five-traits-ptsd.png" alt="people cant stand hearing others chew traits ptsd" title="people cant stand hearing others chew traits ptsd" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Africa Images | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the authors of the study, University of Amsterdam psychiatrist Dr. Dirk Smit, &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/misophonia-shares-genetic-links-with-depression-anxiety-and-ptsd/" rel="nofollow"&gt;told PsyPost that&lt;/a&gt; "this means that genes that give a sensitivity to PTSD also increase the likelihood for misophonia, and that could point to a shared neurobiological system that affects both. And that could suggest that treatment techniques used for PTSD could also be used for misophonia." There is hope, chewing-sound haters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-with-these-traits-rarely-turned-down-life"&gt;People With These 3 Traits Rarely Get Turned Down In Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Depression and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD is, of course, a more extreme condition usually stemming from extreme trauma, but studies have found that you don't need to have survived something truly harrowing to be predisposed to misophonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr213.pdf"&gt;1 in 5 Americans&lt;/a&gt; experiencing depression and anxiety, it's easy to understand why so many of us seem to cringe at certain sounds as well. When your brain is already overtaxed, silence is sometimes the only thing that can bring a sense of relief. Your cubicle mate clicking their dang pen disrupts this entirely!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Worry, loneliness, or neuroticism from bottling up emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/people-cant-stand-hearing-others-chew-share-traits-worry.png" alt="people cant stand hearing others chew traits worrying" title="people cant stand hearing others chew traits worrying" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;KATRIN BOLOVTSOVA | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies on misophonia have found that those reporting the condition are also much more likely to internalize negative feelings instead of talking them through, dealing with them head-on, or seeking help. This is a natural inclination for many of us, but mental health professionals say it can be a key cause of conditions like anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No surprise, then, that it is also linked to misophonia. &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(20)30697-1/abstract" rel="nofollow"&gt;A 2020 study&lt;/a&gt;, also co-authored by Dr. Smit, found that people who bottle up their emotions tend toward feelings of worry, loneliness, and neuroticism, as well as misophonia, which makes sense. Having to listen to that guy chomp on his gum like a cow can pretty easily drive you over the edge when you're already full of repressed emotions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-who-put-off-sleep-even-though-tired-share-these-traits"&gt;People Who Put Off Going To Sleep At Night Even Though They’re Tired Usually Share These 6 Specific Traits, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Guilt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with worry, loneliness, and neuroticism, another feeling that often results from pushing down your emotions is guilt. Perhaps most fascinating of all, it just may be one of the true linchpins for misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Smit and his colleagues explained in their 2023 study, much of the research on misophonia argues that the condition "is based on &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/happy-people-resist-wallow-low-vibration-emotion"&gt;the feelings of guilt&lt;/a&gt; about the evoked irritation and anger rather than behavioral expressions of anger itself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, it's not so much the lady breathing heavily in the bus seat next to you that's driving you mad, so much as the guilt you feel for wanting to deck her into next week. (Which you should release yourself from, by the way. It's not your fault she breathes like a dang fog horn!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Tinnitus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the most fascinating correlation of all: &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350156" rel="nofollow"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;, the neurological condition in which people hear a frequent or sometimes constant ringing, buzzing, hissing, or clicking in their ears. The condition is more of a symptom of other issues than it is a condition in and of itself, and it turns out it's the symptom that ties all these things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are all &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/3/1169" rel="nofollow"&gt;highly correlated with tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;, and tinnitus, in turn, is highly correlated with misophonia. And as someone with all five of these conditions, I am &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/should-i-say-sorry-if-i-dont-mean-it-when-to-apologize"&gt;never apologizing&lt;/a&gt; for telling someone if they don't take the batteries out of that clock, I will burn their entire house down ever again.

One person is a Utah County resident and the other is from the southwest health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, two of the five Utahns who have been diagnosed with measles had to be hospitalized due to complications but have since been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among the five positive cases that have been reported, two of the people diagnosed with measles in Utah are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns," said the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's additions to the measles count in the state follow closely on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51334912" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;two other measles diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, also from Utah County and the southwest health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials on Tuesday said during the first person's "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large majority of Utahns (more than 90%) have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection," the health department said. "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzkyn001b3b77t8ije5p5@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We emailed our management company and the guy was like, ‘Oh, fine. You can have it.’” Selena says. “But when we moved in, the apartment was a mess. There were so many issues. I think they were trying to get rid of us.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzl13001c3b775dca3kf6@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The property-management representative agreed to meet to discuss how to get the unit move-in ready. “We thought he would be this old angry man who hated his job and was taking it out on us,” says Selena. “Instead, it was this cute boy who went to high school with my college roommate.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzl2g001d3b7789l7th0r@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She and Max exchanged numbers — first as tenant and landlord. “But I very quickly had the feeling, ‘Oh, wow. I met my husband.’” says Selena. Within months, they were dating, and three years later, Max proposed to Selena during a Thailand vacation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzl42001e3b77ylryvw1k@published" data-word-count="41"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon after, in the midst of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/04/5-wedding-experts-share-their-insider-tips.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wedding planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, she realized her period was late — and she was pregnant. “I’d had my &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-fda-approves-miudella-a-new-copper-iud.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IUD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; removed to give my body a break,” she says. “We were being careful, but we had an uncareful evening.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzl90001f3b77qkiii4g3@published" data-word-count="28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;While a surprise, the news left them both overjoyed. Starting a family “definitely was in the cards,” says Selena. “Just probably not in the order that it happened.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzlb4001g3b77t7kkmap1@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside from morning sickness, Selena’s pregnancy was “easy-peasy.” Then one morning in her third trimester, while she was examining her changing body, she felt a lump in her breast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgzptf001p3b77zowf84kc@published" data-word-count="4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what happened next.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgvutb001s0iidwe5uz5b9@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;During my pregnancy, I felt great. I looked great. I also started &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/pregnancy-changing-body.html"&gt;becoming more aware of my body&lt;/a&gt;. I never had big boobs, and all of a sudden I did. Right after my 30th birthday, when I was 30 weeks, I was admiring them in the shower when I felt a lump shaped like a barbell. I immediately got a sinking feeling but tried not to worry. I figured it could be clogged milk ducts or my milk coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh0992001y3b77v7kjeoyc@published" data-word-count="18"&gt;Obviously, it’s easy to go doomsday. But my mind was going, &lt;em&gt;Yeah, there’s just no way it’s cancer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgvutb001u0iidthy0hjvf@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;I scheduled a one-off appointment with my OB/GYN’s office, and the first available appointment was with a provider I’d never seen before. They claimed it likely was nothing but ordered an ultrasound to be safe. When the results came back, they immediately sent me for a biopsy. A few days later, they also wanted a biopsy of a lymph node.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh0lfu00263b77x58dvbb5@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;My parents took me to that appointment. The radiologist could tell right away that there was no cancer in my lymph node, which was great news. Then the nurse practitioner afterward sat me down and said, “Because you have breast cancer …” She was so sweet, and I felt so bad for her. She had assumed that my OB already told me that the tumor in my breast was malignant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh0lfu00273b77jwkmtxon@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;I felt bewildered and almost in disbelief. Immediately, I was like, “Please go get my mom.” She had lymphoma a few years prior and had just dealt with her own mom’s passing, and we’re very close, so she came in, shaking. Then they brought my dad back. He’s not a crier, but when I told him I had stage-two breast cancer, he collapsed onto the floor and cried. It was awful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh0lfv00283b772e8tzhvk@published" data-word-count="27"&gt;Max was in Westchester for work at the time. It typically took him 40 minutes to drive home. He got to the doctor in under 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdgvutb001w0iid68572f7u@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;I learned I had breast cancer at 9 a.m. and had my first oncologist appointment at 5 p.m. She squeezed me in after hearing about my situation. I’ve always had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-treatment-natural-remedy-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;a fear of chemo&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s what the doctor told me I would need: targeted therapy paired with chemotherapy. Then she said, “We want to deliver you early, in two weeks, so we can start treatment.” Max and I were like, &lt;em&gt;“Excuse me?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh12rn002f3b77da4pctuq@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;I had an aggressive form of cancer that was going to quickly grow and spread. The alternative was they could start treating me immediately with a different chemotherapy drug that was cleared for use during pregnancy. I couldn’t have coffee, a turkey sandwich, or sushi while I was pregnant, but they could pump something into me that was gonna knock me on my ass for a week at a time. It sounded so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh1ekq002s3b77kq4zpgna@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;By the time we got home that night, my parents and Max had started telling people the baby was coming sooner than expected. My younger brother was out at a bar with his friends. He called me, a little tipsy, and gave me the biggest pump-up talk. I didn’t even know he was capable of that. He focused on how Max and I were going to be great parents and cancer didn’t know what was coming. He totally got my mind-set right. I’ll remember that forever.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh1vhg00363b77dmxe2nhe@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;We got a second opinion, but it wasn’t hard to decide to deliver six weeks early, at 34 weeks. Still, the situation was overwhelming. We hadn’t even set up our crib. I don’t even know if we &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a crib. We had been counting on that extra six weeks. Suddenly, I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, shit. This is real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh22re003d3b7730b7pt4x@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;My son’s original due date was November 23. Max and I were both born on the 23rd, so the number felt incredibly important to us. Our doctor agreed to deliver him on October 23, a few days after they initially wanted to, so that we could have our date.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh22re003e3b77cb3l15um@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;Wyatt was four pounds, seven ounces when he was born by C-section. They let me kiss and rub cheeks with him before whisking him away to the NICU. Max went with him. I have a few videos, but I can’t watch them because Wyatt was so little. He had the feeding tube, the nose tube, all the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh22re003f3b77p34ezdtv@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;Because I’d had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/09/i-didnt-want-an-epidural-until-i-very-much-did.html"&gt;an epidural&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn’t walk, and they couldn’t bring Wyatt to me. It was a good 12 hours before I could visit him. My parents, in-laws, aunt, grandma, best friend, and sister all saw Wyatt in the NICU before I did. I remember joking about it at the time and only retrospectively realizing how sad it was.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh2d4p003s3b77xobc2dlb@published" data-word-count="38"&gt;Wyatt spent 17 days in the hospital. It was the best-case scenario — he just needed extra support to learn how to feed. I had been given a steroid shot before delivery to help his lungs develop faster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh2jd7003z3b771hdxe6zx@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;In between going back and forth to the NICU, I had to get my mammogram, MRI, and other scans. I got fitted for a cold cap to try to save my hair. I went to the dentist, because you’re not supposed to get a dental cleaning during chemo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh2jd700403b77m5yuotr3@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;I could pump breast milk from my healthy breast, but Wyatt couldn’t drink. Sucking isn’t an instinct that babies have at 34 weeks. So I was pumping off one boob and he was getting my milk, but he wasn’t able to latch. I was holding him and doing skin-to-skin, but it made me so sad that we didn’t have the breastfeeding bond.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh2toi004d3b77kpliwlru@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;There was no time for me to freeze my eggs or create embryos. Instead, the doctor planned to give me a shot called Zoladex once a month throughout my treatment that would put my ovaries to sleep so they were less likely to get affected by the chemo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh2yq9004k3b77s7cdc5zb@published" data-word-count="34"&gt;I’ve always wanted at least two kids, so I did have anxiety about whether it would work. But at that point, I’d just had a baby. It was like, one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh39uz004x3b77b8i0rwtr@published" data-word-count="17"&gt;Once Wyatt came home from the NICU, we had a few days together before I started chemo.&lt;/p&gt;

But three weeks postpartum, still bleeding and leaking, I was leaving my newborn to start chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

And then every third Tuesday, I had two targeted therapies, which would continue for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

I spent a lot of time either in the bathroom or asleep, especially in the days after my infusion. But, while I was recovering, I was also able to cuddle and watch Bravo with Wyatt, sing songs and read on the couch, and bond with him in our own way. He was my true cuddle buddy and my reason for leaving him each week for nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;

Wyatt was held and cared for in the newborn stage by more people than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

He was always distracting me or reminding me of the good or just being positive. He was also an insanely wonderful father and took on a lot with a newborn at home. He did everything he could for us — aside from putting his dishes in the dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

Wedding planning was also a good distraction. I approved our wedding invitation from the chemo chair. Being young and having friends who weren’t yet parents meant there were still a lot of social gatherings and things to get dressed for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh3wyk005s3b7763ryoayf@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;To keep some normalcy, Max and I tried to go out on weekends. We went out to dinner. We went to parties, although I wasn’t drinking. We visited family. I wanted to keep things “me” and not just lie in bed all day, which isn’t my nature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh3wyk005t3b77hys4tap6@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;Scalp cooling likely saved 70 percent of my hair. The loss was mostly underneath, where no one could notice. That also played a role in me still feeling normal. Wyatt and I would go to a weekly moms group and no one knew I was in cancer treatment. I just looked like a tired new mom.&lt;/p&gt;

A few weeks later, in February 2020, Max and I got married at a restaurant in the East Village. Aside from not having eyebrows at the time, I felt like myself. I had a few glasses of Champagne and a very cool outfit, and stayed out till 4 a.m. My husband’s oldest friend married us, and our grandparents were present. It was very special. Wyatt was passed around the whole ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

It showed a complete response. I continued targeted therapy every three weeks, but the side effects were manageable — stomachaches and some weird rashes. Then, I had 15 rounds of radiation. I thought that would be easy, but it sucked. My skin was burnt and crusty.&lt;/p&gt;

I had needed to ditch Wyatt once a week for treatment, and then slept all the next day. I was in and out of appointments the whole first year of his life. It took me a little to realize, &lt;em&gt;Oh my God, I didn’t have what they had&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh4tav006y3b77cbwyffbb@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;As Wyatt got older, I started noticing that he ran to Max instead of me often if he fell or got hurt. At first, I thought it was somehow my fault. I had to remind myself that there are so many people Wyatt bonded with while I was sick. He is so special to a lot of people who love me.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh55n9007b3b776xk0jbzc@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;My doctor said I would need a mammogram every three to four months and an ultrasound every six months for the next three years. If the cancer didn’t return within three years of my diagnosis, they said I could think about having another baby. But then they switched that to three years after finishing &lt;em&gt;treatment.&lt;/em&gt; I lost it when I heard that. At that point, Wyatt was almost 3 and a half. I wanted to plan our future! Having another baby was supposed to be my choice now. Max and I were super ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt a little guilty about how easily it happened, in spite of everything.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh5m65007v3b77vra07ivh@published" data-word-count="30"&gt;I scheduled my daughter’s C-section with the same OB who delivered Wyatt. When she walked into the OR that morning, we both started crying. She was like, “It’s different now.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh5r4s00823b77qt885i58@published" data-word-count="34"&gt;And it was. My daughter was a cookie-cutter 8:30 a.m. C-section. We were in a tiny room versus a huge one. And Quinn came out seven and a half pounds, just this chunky lady.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcdh5r4s00833b77839w1egt@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;She was also my responsibility within minutes. I was like, “Oh! This is what it’s supposed to be like.” Just to have her sleep in the room with me? That didn’t happen before. I was able to be a mom sooner. Not that I wasn’t a mom with Wyatt, because I was trying to make him milk and all that stuff. But other people were doing the work. With Quinn, we didn’t get any child care.&lt;/p&gt;

It was just like, “Oh, Selena had her second baby!” As I’ve grown closer with other moms in town, it’s been nice to share a little bit about how special it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

I was asking myself, &lt;em&gt;Could the cancer still be in me, waiting to rear its head? Would going through treatment be harder now? &lt;/em&gt;When I was diagnosed, I just wanted to be alive, so I did what I had to do. Now, I feel the darkness and dreads more.&lt;/p&gt;

The first is that I got diagnosed when I was pregnant and now have a healthy 5-year-old son. The second is that I was able to conceive after chemotherapy, and now I have a daughter who just turned 2. They’re both miracles. But sometimes I forget, in the minutia of the day, how lucky I am.&lt;/p&gt;

The bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhi&lt;/em&gt; now shows resistance to almost every antibiotic that doctors throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The speed at which highly‑resistant strains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666524722000933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S. typhi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern,” said Jason Andrews of &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/175241/cdc_175241_DS1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-typhoid-resistance-happens"&gt;How typhoid resistance happens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-associated-infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; depends on antibiotics killing the typhoid bacterium faster than it mutates. That race is tilting toward the microbe because antimicrobial resistance grows every time a course of drugs is cut short or the wrong medicine is prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic work on 3,489 isolates from India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh shows resistant typhoid strains replacing susceptible ones in only a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those isolates carry three mutations in the DNA‑gyrase genes that raise the ciprofloxacin dose needed a thousand‑fold, and remove a key outpatient option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third‑generation cephalosporins followed ciprofloxacin onto the front line in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, a 2025 survey in Ahmedabad, India, has uncovered a cluster showing resistance to ceftriaxone, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole&lt;/a&gt;. This marks “the largest hotspot of ceftriaxone‑resistant typhoid identified to date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only azithromycin still works reliably by mouth. Laboratory monitoring in Pakistan found minimum inhibitory concentrations creeping upward, and a U.S. bulletin this year recorded the first two homegrown azithromycin‑resistant cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typhoid resistance there comes from a single change in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AcrB efflux pump&lt;/a&gt;, which ejects the drug before it can act. That mutation has appeared at least seven separate times since 2013 according to whole‑genome timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When azithromycin finally fails, intravenous carbapenems will be the fallback. Those drugs are expensive and scarce in many endemic regions, making hospitalization the only path to survival for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-typhoid-vaccines-on-deck"&gt;Typhoid vaccines on deck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three typhoid vaccines are licensed worldwide, and the conjugate vaccine works in babies as young as six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; “recommends introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccine in countries with a high burden of the disease,” a policy that is meant to cut cases before resistance spreads any wider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan added the shot to its routine schedule in 2019 as the first nation to do so. Early surveillance suggests fewer childhood cases in vaccinated districts, which will buy time for antibiotic pipelines to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic models from India project that urban vaccination could prevent more than one‑third of typhoid deaths over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That payoff grows if resistant strains keep rising, because every averted infection also avoids an expensive hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fueling-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;Fueling antibiotic resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same flights that move people, move &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-disinfectants-kill-99-9-of-germs-not-100/"&gt;pathogens&lt;/a&gt;. Genomic “family trees” trace at least 59 intercontinental jumps of resistant &lt;em&gt;S. typhi&lt;/em&gt; since 1990, with most departures being from South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a strain lands, local water and sanitation gaps let it settle in. East Africa and Southeast Asia now report lineages that match South Asian ancestors, base pair for base pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even countries with safe water see spillover. The CDC recorded about 450 culture‑confirmed typhoid cases in the United States in 2019, nearly all linked to recent travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors there face a puzzle because routine empiric therapy may not cover the imported H58 lineage, which often resists five or more drugs. Rapid susceptibility testing, still unavailable in many clinics, is becoming a must‑have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-typhoid-resistance-surveillance"&gt;Typhoid resistance surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continuous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traveler-genomic-surveillance/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genomic surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, new resistant strains can spread silently across borders before health systems react. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study tracked nearly 8,000 &lt;em&gt;S. typhi&lt;/em&gt; genomes to map origins and movements, but this kind of data is still rare in low‑resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-study-shows-that-dairy-milk-cheese-consumption-improves-gut-biodiversity-health/"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; policy must keep pace with these shifts. Countries with rising resistance should not wait for full outbreaks before introducing vaccines or adjusting treatment protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid response depends on accurate, real‑time data and public health systems empowered to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-clinicians-can-do"&gt;What clinicians can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full 10 to 14 day &lt;a href="https://jptcp.com/index.php/jptcp/article/download/9663/9003/20004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;azithromycin courses&lt;/a&gt; remain effective in most places, but follow‑up cultures are critical. Skipping the post‑treatment check risks silent carriers reseeding communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where laboratories can measure ceftriaxone MICs, a rising trend should trigger public health alerts. Combination therapy, for example azithromycin plus meropenem in severe disease, can slow further resistance but raises costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also need to report every instance of typhoid resistance and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/secrets-of-cancer-cell-death-may-transform-treatment/"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; failure. Aggregated data guide updates to national formularies faster than peer‑reviewed studies can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-big-gains-from-basic-safety-measures"&gt;Big gains from basic safety measures &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are trialing new &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557592/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oral β‑lactamase inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; that restore activity to cheap penicillins, but results are years away. Phage therapy and resistant‑bacteria “decoys” are on bench tops, and are promising but unproven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the biggest gains come from the basics. Safe water, sewer infrastructure, and reliable refrigeration cut typhoid risk more than any pill ever will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each dollar spent there pays back across multiple diseases, not just typhoid.

They are also involved in immune functions such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-022-00760-x"&gt;controlling inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-024-01429-4"&gt;regulating cell death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006"&gt;responding to infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from my colleagues and I revealed that mitochondria play another &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003"&gt;key role in your immune response&lt;/a&gt;: sensing bacterial activity and helping neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, trap and kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past 16 years, &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lWs4Kd0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;my research has focused&lt;/a&gt; on understanding the decisions immune cells make during infection and how the breakdown of these decision-making processes cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggestshttps://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggests?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lab's recent findings shed light on why people with autoimmune diseases such as lupus may struggle to fight infections, revealing a potential link between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003"&gt;dysfunctional mitochondria and weakened immune defenses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The immune system's secret weapons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-02049-y"&gt;most abundant type of immune cell&lt;/a&gt; and serve as the immune system's first responders. One of their key defense mechanisms is releasing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2017.105"&gt;neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs&lt;/a&gt; – weblike structures composed of DNA and antimicrobial proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sticky NETs trap and neutralize invading microbes, preventing their spread in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165910" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-642x482.jpg" alt="Bright mitochondria on black background" class="size-medium wp-image-165910" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Neutrophil_Extracellular_Trap.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165910" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neutrophils (yellow) eject a NET (green) to ensnare bacteria (purple). Other cells, such as red blood cells (orange), may also get trapped.

However, our study found that mitochondria can detect a specific bacterial byproduct – lactate – and use that signal to initiate NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lactate is commonly associated with &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/sports-medicine/resources/lactate"&gt;muscle fatigue in people&lt;/a&gt;. But in the context of bacterial infections, it plays a different role. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15657"&gt;Many bacteria release lactate&lt;/a&gt; as part of their own energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My team found that once bacteria are engulfed by a compartment of the cell &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/17-4-pathogen-recognition-and-phagocytosis"&gt;called the phagosome&lt;/a&gt;, neutrophils can sense the presence of this lactate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Side-by-side comparison of labeled illustration of cross-section of mitochondria and its micrograph" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=266&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=266&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=266&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=335&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=335&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/615894/original/file-20240827-16-7e8rrs.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=335&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mitochondria do so much more than just produce energy.

Once the bacteria are released outside the cell, other immune cells can kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we blocked the mitochondria's ability to sense lactate, neutrophils &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003"&gt;failed to produce NETs effectively&lt;/a&gt;. This meant bacteria were more likely to escape capture and proliferate, showing how crucial this mechanism is to immune defense. This process highlights an intricate dialogue between the bacteria's metabolism and the host cell's energy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Here, a neutrophil engulfs MRSA bacteria (green).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this finding surprising is that the mitochondria within cells are able to detect bacteria trapped in phagosomes, even though the microbes are enclosed in a separate space. Somehow, mitochondrial sensors can pick up cues from within these compartments – an impressive feat of cellular coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Targeting mitochondria to fight infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is part of a growing field &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00840-x"&gt;called immunometabolism&lt;/a&gt;, which explores how &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-metabolism-a-biochemist-explains-how-different-people-convert-energy-differently-and-why-that-matters-for-your-health-211816"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and immune function are deeply intertwined. Rather than viewing cellular metabolism as strictly a means to generate energy, researchers are now recognizing it as a central driver of immune decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria sit at the heart of this interaction. Their ability to sense, respond to and even shape the metabolic environment of a cell gives them a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006"&gt;critical role&lt;/a&gt; in determining how and when immune responses are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, our findings provide a key reason why patients with a chronic autoimmune disease called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535405/"&gt;systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/a&gt; often suffer from recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria in the neutrophils of lupus patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003"&gt;fail to sense bacterial lactate&lt;/a&gt; properly. As a result, NET production was significantly reduced. This mitochondrial dysfunction could explain why lupus patients are more vulnerable to bacterial infections – even though their immune systems are constantly activated due to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation points to mitochondria's central role in balancing immune responses. It connects two seemingly unrelated issues: immune overactivity, as seen in lupus, and immune weakness like increased susceptibility to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mitochondria work correctly, they help neutrophils mount an effective, targeted attack on bacteria. But when mitochondria are impaired, this system breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Microscopy image of long threads extending from round blobs" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/674564/original/file-20250616-56-rtquu3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Neutrophils unable to effectively produce NETs may contribute to the development of lupus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For instance, drugs that enhance mitochondrial sensing could boost NET production in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, for conditions where NETs contribute to tissue damage – such as in severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="165908" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; or autoimmune diseases – it might be beneficial to limit this response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our study raises the question of whether other immune cells use similar mechanisms to sense microbial metabolites, and whether other bacterial byproducts might serve as immune signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these pathways in more detail could lead to new treatments that modulate immune responses more precisely, reducing collateral damage while preserving antimicrobial defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are not just the powerhouses of the cell – they are the immune system's watchtowers, alert to even the faintest metabolic signals of bacterial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers' understanding of their roles expands, so too does our &lt;em&gt;appreciation for the complexity – and adaptability – of our cellular defenses.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255939/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/andrew-monteith-2367958"&gt;Andrew Monteith&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Microbiology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-tennessee-688"&gt;University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

All you need is 20 minutes each day. Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK recently identified 5 easy ways to boost your brain, and none of them require more than 20 minutes a day! Here's taking a look at them...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pick an activity that you enjoy (and not just for the heck of it)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Schott makes it clear that for your brain to boost, you need to do things that simulate it, and not just engage it. For this, it is important to find something that you actually like doing. It could be cooking, reading a book, playing some music, or even gardening. However, Dr Schott advises against doing anything "just for the heck of it". He says that this can have an adverse effect on your brain. Do things that you have a genuine interest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do something active every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be something drastic like an intense workout session at the gym, rather it can be a brisk walking session, some yoga, dancing or even some cycling. Basically, anything that makes your body work harder is good for you. Not only does exercise keep your weight under check, it is also great for your heart, and naturally brings down BP, and cholesterol. Not only that, exercise betters your mood too, and brings down anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Go on walks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing about walking is that it can easily fit into your routine without going out of the way. If you are otherwise exercising as well, walking is a great way to tone those muscles, and keeps your heart healthy. You do not have to be a marathon runner, but just small tweaks to your routine can make you healthier. Examples include taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking up to the market, or walking while taking calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cultivate social connections&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings are not wired to spend their days in isolation. If you are unmarried, (or even married) you need to have a close social circle of friends and family whom you meet often, and enjoy being together with. There is enough research to show that isolation can increase the risk of dementia, so it is imperative to get out and make some new friends, if needed! Sharing a laugh (or tears) with a friend or family is not only priceless, but also has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep your BP under check&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, or hypertension, is often called the “silent killer” because it usually has no symptoms but can cause serious damage to your heart and brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Schott says that it is imperative that one keeps their BP under check and take all the efforts to bring it down. For this, the neurologist explains that regular moderate exercise relaxes your blood vessels and improves circulation. This natural effect helps lower your blood pressure, sometimes as effectively as medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/neurologist-says-you-can-cut-31922767--" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/neurologist-says-you-can-cut-31922767&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgJBVV95cUxQSHpMWEJQUG1VMHlmdERBS3E0V01razFxbmhGUENfLUtoZUZheWNWTk1zeVNXWUxqdWtlTzhQeTFZdkpCNDl2V3dlSFV5WENfWW9sUW1wbXhfY2poT2IwbHlwalZvQy1OVlFxcC1zWkFLZ1F1RExRcTdoODJMTVNxMy1SN21UckhfeEREWENCQ1RtSWdxTHhOZHNlMG44OHJ2eTd3djM2MUlIdFZvUUFYd2FGQjh4Qk16bHRKazNRUW56TmZ6dnRocm1HRllpSm00c0syd0QtNHBwNGs5Z0doVHA2VmJqTWhvSjhyb2xZS0VaUEFodDFQaE1jQS11cHVvTGlTSmNsVTFFTThtaVdfMF9Dd2ctd1V5SEdtbnowblowYTZ1WnY5aFN3</guid></item><item><title>在北弗吉尼亚州调查的另一种可能的麻疹暴露- WTOP | Another possible measles exposure investigated in Northern Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNLWRkZ21UQVNfZmgxY0hneFo0LUJyTHpVUE9aYkUyTVJOY3NRVW9IZ3RzVi00bVZidEEtQ2hPOGNyN1FFVTVlcE5iSFR3aE9VRGozY28zS01sN2pCcy1iRldBWVJVeVQtRzFuY01mWGpvOVQteThzU2JmelJ5dnpiRkVWaDJwM09CVVFWSk1JZTRHSjkxQ05Qcy1xazVlalYzSlZ3Wg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;The person was an international traveler visiting North Carolina.

                &lt;p&gt;Another potential measles exposure is being investigated in Northern Virginia after someone with a confirmed case of the virus traveled through Dulles International Airport last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Virginia Department of Health, the person went through Dulles’ Concourse A and the baggage area between 7:45 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on June 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That person then headed through the departures area of the main terminal, east security checkpoint, on transportation to Concourse C and inside Concourse C between 8 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VDH said the person was an international traveler visiting North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are working to figure out who might have been exposed and contacting passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, VDH said there have been three reported cases of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, a &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/05/2nd-case-of-measles-has-been-confirmed-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;case of measles&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed in May after the state’s first measles case of 2025 was &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And D.C. health officials &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/06/dc-health-officials-confirm-case-of-measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed a case in the District earlier this month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is defined as “a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes,” DC Health said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest measles information from VDH is available &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/#2025-exposures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, there have been close to 1,200 confirmed measles cases this year, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/measles-outbreaks-in-michigan-and-pennsylvania-end-while-texas-logs-just-4-new-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. With the rise in measles cases, the CDC is urging all people traveling internationally to be &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/all-international-travelers-should-get-measles-vaccinations-cdc-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fully vaccinated against the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As temperatures rise, so does the risk of heat-related illness – especially for people taking certain prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body uses several mechanisms to regulate temperature: sweating, blood flow to the skin and fluid balance. But some commonly prescribed drugs interfere with these processes, making it harder to stay cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few you should know about this summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two specific types of antidepressants – &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/medicines-and-psychiatry/ssri-antidepressants/overview/"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) and &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/depression/prescribing-information/tricyclic-antidepressants/"&gt;tricyclics&lt;/a&gt; (TCAs) – may make summer harder to cope with. They could even cause &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-62496985"&gt;heat intolerance&lt;/a&gt; due to how they affect the body’s ability to sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these antidepressants are believed to partly work by affecting neurotransmitter levels in the brain – primarily serotonin and noradrenaline. However, they may also affect other neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, TCAs can &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/364738"&gt;block acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt;, a neurotransmitter important for sweating. This may cause some patients to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18217788/#:%7E:text=Drugs%20that%20induce%20hyperhidrosis%2C%20or%20sweating%20in,agents%2C%20carbonic%20anhydrase%20inhibitors%20and%20tricyclic%20antidepressants."&gt;sweat less&lt;/a&gt;. On a hot day, this could make it hard to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TCAs also increase noradrenaline levels, a neurotransmitter that stimulates sweat glands. This can increase sweating. In fact, both SSRIs and TCAs can increase sweating in users. Data shows &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-200831020-00002"&gt;up to 14%&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant users experience this side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSRIs may also &lt;a href="https://inpharmd.com/inquiries/64a766649747a03e8bc259f52bf4b1d3bc10af53c994d252534aa6a6ef3b47e0"&gt;interfere with the hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt; – the brain region that controls body temperature and tells the sweat glands to start producing sweat. But this signal may be affected by the increased serotonin levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since sweating is a key cooling mechanism, any disruptions to this process can lead to heat-related illness. Excess sweating may also &lt;a href="https://www.sweathelp.org/home/preventing-dehydration.html"&gt;cause dehydration&lt;/a&gt; if fluids aren’t replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Antipsychotics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics are used to treat psychosis, which can occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They do this by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109"&gt;blocking the neurotransmitter dopamine&lt;/a&gt; – which in turn affects levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This can disrupt the hypothalamus’s ability to sense and respond to body temperature changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, someone taking an antipsychotic might not feel overheated or thirsty when it’s hot out. This can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109/"&gt;low blood pressure and reduced heart function&lt;/a&gt;. The body then tries to compensate by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109/"&gt;narrowing the blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and holding in heat. This in turn reduces sweating and makes it harder to cool down properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, antipsychotics have &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00228-019-02763-5"&gt;anticholinergic properties&lt;/a&gt;. This means they block the action of acetylcholine, making it harder to sweat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Heart medications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta-blockers are used to manage heart failure and arrhythmias. They do this by lowering heart rate and reducing how forcefully the heart pumps. But this can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpt.12294?saml_referrer"&gt;limit blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the skin – making it harder for the body to release heat on hot days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diuretics are also commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure or heart failure. But as these drugs &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557838/"&gt;increase urine output&lt;/a&gt;, this may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during hot weather. With less fluid available, the body may struggle to sweat properly. If you become &lt;a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/water-balance/dehydration#Symptoms_v770569"&gt;severely dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;, you might actually stop feeling thirsty.  Blood pressure can also drop, which may cause dizziness or fainting – especially when standing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Various heart medications can increase risk of dehydration in hot weather.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/active-senior-man-exhausted-tired-resting-2399009235"&gt;pics five/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramipril and losartan, also used to manage blood pressure, can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1527-5299.2001.00274.x"&gt;increase the risk of dehydration&lt;/a&gt; as well. These drugs block a system in the body that helps control blood pressure, fluid balance and thirst. This may reduce your natural urge to drink, increasing dehydration risk when it’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Stimulants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stimulants – such as the amphetamines used for ADHD – affect many brain chemicals, including dopamine and noradrenaline. This can increase body temperature, boost metabolism and change how the body sweats – all of which can &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1509385/full"&gt;make it harder to cool down&lt;/a&gt;, especially when exercising or in hot weather. This can also potentially lead to dehydration, overheating or even heatstroke. Stimulants may also reduce the feeling of tiredness, which can cause people to overexert themselves without realising the danger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1509385/full"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows people with ADHD who take stimulants may actually have a lower chance of heat-related illnesses – but larger trials are needed to investigate further. The researchers hypothesise that this protective effect may be due to factors such as lower body weight and users staying hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Insulin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm temperatures cause the body’s blood vessels to dilate (widen) in order to help us cool off. But this action means insulin is &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-and-hot-weather.html"&gt;absorbed into the bloodstream faster&lt;/a&gt; as there’s enhanced blood flow to the area where insulin is injected – making blood sugar drop more quickly. This can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt; (low blood glucose level), which may lead to dizziness, shaking, sweating, irritability and even potentially loss of consciousness or seizures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faster insulin absorption can also make it harder for people with diabetes to notice signs of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia/"&gt;low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; in the heat, since common symptoms may be mistaken for being hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat can also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1079525/"&gt;degrade insulin&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its effectiveness and making it unsafe. This is why insulin should be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37930742"&gt;stored in the fridge&lt;/a&gt; until use – especially in summer. Damaged insulin will &lt;a href="https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pdi.1960020414"&gt;change appearance&lt;/a&gt; – turning cloudy or changing colour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding heatstroke&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/"&gt;Older adults&lt;/a&gt;, people with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4131963/"&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; (especially those with heart or lung disease) and those taking &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4131963/"&gt;multiple prescription drugs&lt;/a&gt; are especially vulnerable to heat-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are &lt;a href="https://www.acutemedicine.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/SAM-Hot-Weather-Health-Plan-2025.pdf"&gt;steps you can take&lt;/a&gt; to stay safe during summer if you’re taking one of these common prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, check labels for storage instructions. Avoid leaving medications in hot places, such as in cars or on windowsills. Insulin isn’t the only drug affected by heat – &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681050.html#:%7E:text=Tell%20your%20doctor%20if%20your,doing%20it%20the%20right%20way."&gt;inhalers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997362/"&gt;EpiPens&lt;/a&gt; can also malfunction or become less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, stay hydrated when it’s hot – unless your doctor has advised otherwise. Dehydration can actually worsen the effects of many medicines. For example, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11932-002-0011-0"&gt;anti-inflammatory painkillers&lt;/a&gt; (such as ibuprofen) are more likely to cause kidney problems and bipolar medicines (including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/"&gt;lithium&lt;/a&gt;) can become toxic if you’re dehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/hottest-part-of-the-day-what-time-temperature-highest-uk-why-peak-1748237?srsltid=AfmBOorOUvbFO1QXy0iBR_4ex9GLQq1xUFHc83fmQZVDHp2uCDQvxS0_"&gt;peak heat hours&lt;/a&gt; and stay in cool environments when possible. Watch for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/supporting-vulnerable-people-before-and-during-hot-weather-healthcare-professionals#who-is-at-risk"&gt;warning signs&lt;/a&gt; of heat-related illness – such as dizziness, confusion, nausea or excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, don’t stop taking your prescriptions medication without medical advice. If it’s affecting your ability to cope with the heat, speak with your doctor or pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is notoriously &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;bad for health&lt;/a&gt;, and a recent study might add "long-term effects on brain health" to the growing list of ways drinking can cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by scientists at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, investigated the impact of regular drinking by examining brain autopsy data from 1,781 individuals, correlating findings with their reported drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables, like smoking and physical activity, the team found that the heaviest drinkers had a 133 percent higher risk of developing vascular brain lesions compared to non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelics-could-rewire-the-brain-to-reduce-alcohol-consumption"&gt;had been heavy drinkers&lt;/a&gt; but since given it up had an 89 percent higher risk, while moderate drinkers had a 60 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-has-a-hidden-rhythm-and-it-may-reveal-how-smart-you-are?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain Has a Hidden Rhythm, And It May Reveal How Smart You Are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy and former heavy drinkers also seemed to have higher odds of other neurological damage than non-drinkers. Heavy drinkers were found to have a 41 percent higher risk of tau protein tangles – a biomarker of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165776" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease – while former heavy drinkers still had a 31 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy drinkers also seemed to die 13 years earlier, on average, than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that the study only shows an association – it doesn't confirm that heavy drinking directly causes the kind of brain damage seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165792" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165792" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-25-at-4.56.07-pm-642x213.png" alt="Heavy Drinkers Have 133% Higher Risk of Brain Lesions, Says New Study" class="wp-image-165792 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-25-at-4.56.07-pm-642x213.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-25-at-4.56.07-pm-768x254.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-25-at-4.56.07-pm-600x199.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-25-at-4.56.07-pm.png 827w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165792" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Signs of hyaline arteriolosclerosis lesions in brain tissue samples, in increasing severity.

In this case, the researchers searched for signs of brain tissue injury, including lesions from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriolosclerosis"&gt;hyaline arteriolosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt; from Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the participants' drinking habits, their next of kin filled out a detailed questionnaire about what their alcohol consumption was like three months before their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers divided the cohort into four groups based on how many drinks they consumed per week, with one drink equaling 14 grams of alcohol. They &lt;span&gt;classified&lt;/span&gt; 965 people as never-drinkers, 319 as moderate drinkers (seven or fewer drinks per week), 129 as heavy drinkers (eight or more per week), and 368 as former heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found heavy drinking is directly linked to signs of injury in the brain, and this can cause long-term effects on brain health, which may impact memory and thinking abilities," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5251"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pathophysiologist Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo from the University of São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding these effects is crucial for public health awareness and continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the increased risks of brain lesions and tau tangles, the team found that former heavy drinkers were more likely to have a lower brain mass-to-body height ratio, and impaired cognitive abilities as judged by their next of kin during an interview. Strangely though, these links weren't found for moderate or heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge the limitations of the study: being a cross-sectional analysis, it can't establish direct causality. They also weren't able to follow patients before death to get more details on their alcohol consumption and other lifestyle factors over time – the duration and changes in their drinking habits couldn't be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the association adds another concern to the long list of potential health troubles that alcohol consumption could trigger, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/moderate-drinking-is-not-good-for-you-after-all-study-finds"&gt;even in moderation&lt;/a&gt;. The stuff is already linked to higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;heart troubles&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-links-alcohol-to-six-major-cancer-types"&gt;types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-5-important-reasons-to-avoid-alcohol-when-injured"&gt;slower healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213555"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some studies show a modest benefit, while others show no benefit at all compared to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FQWI7Z3NNZEHNMXEE5TBUF24NA"&gt;The data are stronger for melatonin, and we know that it is very modestly effective compared to a placebo. Both supplements are generally safe. The major side effects of magnesium are gastrointestinal, especially diarrhea, and the major side effect of melatonin is unwanted sleepiness (such as during the day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HI765SEX4VBZ7ES6V3Z46K22SI"&gt;The best treatment for insomnia remains good sleep hygiene, regular exercise, avoiding troublesome medications and -- in people who need more help -- cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKYP4PVUXBBRJPZTBNS632PUN4"&gt;What I mean by good sleep hygiene includes maintaining a consistent sleep pattern (waking up and falling asleep at the same time on weekends as the weekdays); avoiding bright light (televisions, phones and tablets) in the hours before sleep; avoiding substances that can keep people awake (especially caffeine but also alcohol and nicotine) before bed; and getting out of bed if you know you can’t sleep since you don’t want to associate being in bed with lying awake. A cooler and darker bedroom tends to me more amenable to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z24HFDZDS5FEHCLWSONIUFVH2Y"&gt;I greatly prefer behavioral techniques for insomnia since prescription medications have the potential for side effects as well, including falls and motor vehicle accidents for those who drive the day after taking sleep medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: You recently wrote that “nearly everybody born before 1957 had measles and mumps (but not rubella).” I was born in the early 1950s, so I fall into this category. A few years ago, at my request, my primary care physician did a test to check for immunity for the MMR diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MD4SMAOPOFDSHBPYAWNSGOXVYI"&gt;While the mumps and measles tests came back indicating the positive presence of antibodies, the rubella antibodies test showed no immunity. My physician indicated that because I was not a woman of childbearing years, I did not need to be concerned about getting a rubella vaccine. I have no recollection of having rubella, nor of being (or not being) vaccinated for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WO6TWHBNRVELPKH5CQTHB75LAI"&gt;Do you agree with my doctor’s advice? And if you do recommend being vaccinated, should I try to find a vaccination just for rubella? Or should I get the MMR vaccine, even though I don’t need the measles or mumps vaccines? -- A.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6N4UHNOYNRAVTB46XJWKHW34A4"&gt;ANSWER: While the United States is not experiencing a rubella outbreak now, low rates of childhood immunization in certain communities mean that future outbreaks are possible. Fortunately, rubella is not as contagious as measles, and the risk of complications is much smaller. For this reason, vaccination or testing for immunity is not needed outside of an outbreak except in health care workers and women who are of childbearing age. I agree with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FSFRB3IMEBHBZMBOC5AADN5VK4"&gt;If you choose to get immunized, or if there were an outbreak, I recommend immunization, and you would need the MMR vaccine since no manufacturer makes an individual measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine that is licensed in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHRJ5FZJUBFB3LB2A2QZ33UVLY"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

A 16-year study of over 13,000 adults found that sustained physical activity significantly slowed cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even modest increases in weekly activity, from light chores to vigorous exercise, were associated with measurable brain benefits. The findings underscore the value of building long-term exercise habits to delay dementia and maintain quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Consistent physical activity over many years slows cognitive decline in older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any Movement Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Even mild or moderate activities like vacuuming or gardening make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay Dementia:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular activity could delay the onset of dementia by several years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity is widely recognized as an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle, but a new study from the University of Georgia has found an additional benefit — staving off cognitive decline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the UGA College of Public Health analyzed data from more than 13,000 survey respondents and found that sustained physical activity can reduce the rate of cognitive decline for older adults. This data shows the importance of maintaining consistent physical activity throughout life, said lead author Suhang Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that longer and more frequent engagement in physical activity, was associated with delayed cognitive decline,” said Song, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These protective benefits grew over the length of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Even exercising just once a week makes a difference&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study that followed adults 50 years and over for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents reported how frequently they were physically active as well as their level of activity according to intensity. Vigorous activities included things like running and jogging. Gardening, dancing or stretching were classified as moderate activities while vacuuming, doing laundry and making home repairs were considered mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this slower decline continues, it could potentially delay the onset of dementia by many years.” Said Suhang Song, College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not look at specific exercise time, but rather overall activity habits, and found that individuals who sustained regular physical activity throughout their lives experienced a significantly slower rate of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, increasing vigorous physical activity from one to three times per month to once per week was linked to a measurable slowing of cognitive decline. Even increasing moderate physical activity from once per week to multiple times per week led to a slower rate of cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The improvement of the decline rate may seem modest, but it builds up over time. If this slower decline continues, it could potentially delay the onset of dementia by many years, giving people more time to live independently and maintain quality of life,” Song said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Regular activity should be encouraged in practice and policy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on existing research that links physical activity with cognitive health, but what sets this study apart is its focus on the duration and consistency of activity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting consistent physical activity may be a key component of any program aimed at reducing dementia risk in older adults, Song said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting building and maintaining long-term physical activity habits, through guidance from physicians and care providers, could help individuals adopt more sustainable routines by setting realistic, achievable goals, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Song’s message is simple: Move more and keep up activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings offer support in informing targeted interventions that support timely, consistent and long-term physical activity among older adults,” Song said. “From clinical practice and from the intervention side, continuous physical activity is an important proactive measure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and cognitive decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88fbe9fee9e6e6e9e0a6f8ede9fcc8fdefe9a6edecfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Savannah Peat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uga.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Savannah Peat – University of Georgia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tjpad.2025.100194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Long-term cumulative physical activity associated with less cognitive decline: Evidence from a 16-year cohort study&lt;/a&gt;” by Suhang Song et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term cumulative physical activity associated with less cognitive decline: Evidence from a 16-year cohort study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0003"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity (PA) has been reported to delay cognitive decline. However, the role of long-term, cumulative PA (cPA) in cognitive decline remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0004"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal study obtained data from Health and Retirement Study, 2004-2020. Global cognition was operationalized as the sum of memory and executive function scores on a battery of cognitive tests. cPA was operationalized as the area under the curve of the metabolic equivalent of tasks (MET) adjusted PA. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted to examine the associations between cPA and cognitive change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0005"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 13,450 cognitively healthy participants, with a mean follow-up duration of 11.06 (SD=4.91) years. Higher cPA was associated with delayed declines in global cognition (p&amp;lt;.001), memory (p&amp;lt;.001) and executive function (p&amp;lt;.001), and such protective benefits grew over the 16-year study period. Longer PA engagement was associated with progressively delayed cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0006"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PA engagement over long timeframes may better maintain cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:52:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE81ZTF4ejF0RExIWXhMQzNZbFpNcFh0ZTJGZXFCY1ZTVzJual8zWXk5QU42cS1NcjM3WUJOQ3g3eExEUGI1NVRIWkR3dnJkMGNqaVl2OEdLNkxlRllfeVhlcVVHRHV4UTlOU0xQYw</guid></item><item><title>骨盆底理疗师的“拒绝大便”和其他好建议-美国国家公共广播电台 | 'Say no to power peeing' and other good tips from a pelvic floor physical therapist - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5MdG9OWDRPcWZDRTRPam5HQUZYZWtLSEhXU0NubHhDeFZoR21VdjdsbGZocWo1WmRxQWFiUHZVNnNsMHhZeGpybTBGNjE5a2pDUVphMlRHNTF1bXh4NHZZcC0ycm1CdkZneWdZbWlJd0RpOHM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Painful sex. Urinary leakage. Constipation. Weak orgasms. What do these unpleasant experiences have in common?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They can all be symptoms of a pelvic floor dysfunction in women, says &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Sara Reardon&lt;/a&gt;, a pelvic floor physical therapist who has been in the field for nearly two decades. She is the author of &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/floored/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Floored: A Woman's Guide to Pelvic Floor Health at Every Age and Stage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in June.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22729-pelvic-floor-muscles" target="_blank"&gt;pelvic floor&lt;/a&gt; is a basket of muscles that sits at the bottom of your pelvis and has an important role, Reardon says&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It supports organs like your bladder, bowels and reproductive system. It also works with your abdominal muscles to support your spine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But for as much as we use our pelvic floor, "many of us don't know these muscles exist," she says. "Therefore, if a problem arises, [we don't know] how to evaluate it and get treatment for it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One in three women will experience a pelvic floor disorder in her lifetime, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/17474108.4.2.165" target="_blank"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;including young women and postmenopausal women who have never given birth, Reardon says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pelvic floor physical therapy, such as certain exercises and stretches, can be an effective way to address some of these issues, she says. Studies have shown it can &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7d4fB8KNrh-5VaoeHBcpeOLdc6OoSXy/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve bowel and bladder control, make sex more enjoyable, decrease lower back pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRuCAtw8_G2srV5SaTVkyuxxZVvqxcur/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve postpartum recovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reardon talked to Life Kit about what people with vaginas should know about their pelvic floor and what to do if you have pelvic floor pain. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some facts from the book that I think people might find surprising: Orgasms are pelvic floor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258326/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;muscle contractions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, those muscles are the ones that contract and relax during an orgasm, and so if you have a pelvic floor muscle issue, it could cause the &lt;a href="https://share.upmc.com/2022/01/sexual-dysfunction/" target="_blank"&gt;inability to orgasm&lt;/a&gt;, pain with orgasms and weak orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing out your pee is not great for you.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yeah. Just say no to &lt;a href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/why-you-shouldnt-push-when-you-pee/" target="_blank"&gt;power peeing&lt;/a&gt;. You want to sit, relax and let it flow. Relaxing your pelvic floor allows your bladder, which is a muscle, to push the urine out, and that's really how you're supposed to pee. Sit instead of hovering, breathe and chill, and then your bladder muscle contracts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tense pelvic floor muscles can cause constipation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's talk about some of the symptoms that can indicate pelvic floor dysfunction. What are common signs you might have pelvic floor tension or tightness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your muscles have to relax fully to empty your bowels. If they're not relaxing because they're overly tight or tense, you can have straining with bowel movements, hemorrhoids, fissures, incomplete emptying and even feeling like your stools are really thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tightness can also lead to having a hard time starting your urine stream. You may feel like your bladder isn't emptying completely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another common symptom is painful intercourse. It can feel like something can't enter the vagina. You may also feel that with inserting tampons or during pelvic examinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to prevent or address pelvic floor tension?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watch your posture. A lot of us sit too much throughout the day. Vary your movements. If you are sitting, keep your feet flat or cross at the ankles. Also, unclench your butt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take some big, deep breaths throughout the day to soften your pelvic floor muscles; then work on stretching with a deep squat or yoga poses like child's pose or happy baby pose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also devices you can use at home for internal massage to the muscles, such as a &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/postpartum-health-and-care/pelvic-wand#definition" target="_blank"&gt;therapy wand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/how-use-vaginal-dilator" target="_blank"&gt;vaginal dilators&lt;/a&gt; to help relax the muscles internally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other sign of pelvic floor dysfunction is weakness. What does that look like in the body?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the things we commonly see are urinary leakage when coughing, sneezing, running and jumping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another is pelvic organ prolapse, where the pelvic organs aren't as supported by that hammock of muscles as we'd like them to be, so they start to drop or push into the vaginal canal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you feel less sensation with intercourse or urinate during intercourse or orgasms, those can be other signs of weak pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we strengthen our pelvic floor muscles? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Work on pelvic floor strengthening exercises. Do quick Kegel contractions and longer-hold five- or 10-second Kegel contractions in different positions and during exercises like lunges and squats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tighten those muscles before activities that cause leakage. I always say, "Kegel before you cough," or "Squeeze before you sneeze."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing is to stop straining [when you go to the bathroom], because that can weaken your pelvic floor over time. For bowel movements, I recommend using a stool under your feet to put you in the squatting position [and make it easier to go].&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are having these symptoms, what should you do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In every state in the United States, you can access a pelvic floor therapist for an evaluation without a referral from a physician.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your insurance may require [a referral], but you can at least have an evaluation, and they can tell you whether you have a pelvic floor muscle issue and connect you with a medical provider who can see you and/or write a prescription to continue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have common signs of infection of the urinary tract or the vagina, your first stop should be checking with a medical provider and getting things [like a urinary tract infection or a yeast infection] ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you look for in a pelvic floor physical therapist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They should be trained and qualified to do a pelvic floor muscle internal assessment to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles. They should not just hook you up to devices like Kegel or electric stimulation machines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The treatment should be a combination of exercise, manual therapy and education. They should also give you things at home to work on so you can do some self-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You want to look for somebody with training and compassion who is a really good listener. We're talking about vulnerable and intimate issues, and if you don't feel comfortable having these conversations and talking about your symptoms with your therapist, I would find a new therapist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

but it is not clear whether other factors also played a part.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is impossible to know exactly how many people in the UK are on weight loss drugs as many users obtain them online through unregulated sources, rather than through their doctors.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials have suggested the jabs could help turn the tide on obesity. However, they have also warned the drugs are not a silver bullet and often come with side effects, commonly including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And the MHRA has also warned that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Mounjaro could make the oral contraceptive pill less effective for some patients.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer said information from the study "will help us to better predict those most at risk of adverse reactions, enabling patients across the UK to receive the safest medicine for them, based on their genetic make-up". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said evidence showed almost a third of side effects to medicines could be prevented with genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is predicted that adverse drug reactions could cost the NHS more than £2.2bn a year in hospital stays alone," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Brown, chief scientific officer at Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said the next step would be to "generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription, supporting a shift towards an increasingly prevention-focused healthcare system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:11:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5TRDJSS3NDNXF5eWs5WldJMWdaT2JGeXk5dF82MFhPNC0zc1J6Rlg1Skg4X2xmSUw5ZTVES2JjbF92WVlWYmFxQm93OUJtYU05ajdRMjk0TlpMQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBhd1FFZmFBdnA1cF91R2R4TWlXWlh4ODV6aEVhbl9YLXBnVEJBb2QzaVd3RGJxbS1sNHBPV2JnbDdfaXJqdEFMTWlsYjlxSFE3dDRYRkxidlVsZXZ2ODFJ</guid></item><item><title>新设备可节省面临5-器官故障的儿童-新闻 | New Device Saves Child Facing 5-Organ Failure - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVGQzRzVBOV9DOUFVNUMzNmhoNW54U1BSTDVMMzF2Sm1PM3VIb05tdV9CeXZDYlRSZnNiR3ZmQ2pzdlBhU1RRZ1hPMWhaY05TVU0yMUlZMi1PVkd6bHZySFAxNTk4d05UM19NUzJmSTB6aEgtdU9saTRvZ3RqQ2VUdWZMbV9YWVBtMmg2TjltOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/first-its-kind-therapeutic-device-saves-child-septic-shock-multiorgan-failure"&gt;Michigan Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have reported a medical first: saving a young child in septic shock and experiencing failure of five organ systems using a new device called the &lt;a href="https://seastarmedical.com/our-solution/"&gt;Selective Cytopheretic Device&lt;/a&gt; (SCD), made by SeaStar Medical. The case, published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00467-025-06798-y?sharing_token=WnP7-NrIdDOCNleHt5EDLPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4KveRkO_RYeE3zwjJAap1foVBxYOb3zsIK2Tu88UMy-e3941qjfjCJgZqPUQXEyeZdZcgNbkh9O_5VDRR98zQ_K0au4Q6Nrphe-0ksMTaXAPtse7jSUIHr5ntJ9Laa1_E%3D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pediatric Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, involved a child with a prior kidney transplant who'd recently started chemotherapy for B-cell leukemia. When the child ended up in the hospital with a severe infection, doctors estimated a 5% chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Conventional treatments didn't seem to be the way forward, so the team opted to try the SCD, a device developed at the University of Michigan over two decades. The SCD, which is now FDA-approved for certain uses, works by filtering the patient's blood outside the body. It temporarily modifies white blood cells to reduce the excessive inflammatory response that can damage organs during severe infections like sepsis.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        There was concern about using the device, as the child's white blood cell count was unusually low due to chemotherapy, raising the risk of worsening the infection. However, after emergency approval, the device was used. The intervention improved blood cell counts and restored kidney and liver function, all without significant side effects. The child was eventually taken off mechanical ventilation and, after 38 days in intensive care, transferred to a general hospital ward. The patient has since returned home, is off dialysis, and is reportedly cancer-free.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;center&gt;
                                        &lt;p id="divStoryContinues"&gt;story continues below&lt;/p&gt;
                                        
                                    &lt;/center&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The SCD therapy won't just stop the storm but could potentially reverse the damage," notes the &lt;a href="https://seastarmedical.com/our-solution/"&gt;SeaStar website&lt;/a&gt;. The success in this case has led to wider adoption at other pediatric centers. One caveat: The research came from the National Institutes of Health and private philanthropy, with some researchers holding financial interests in companies associated with the technology.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

He was shocked to discover he was 8 pounds heavier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b5da4" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was a mess. I was so upset. That’s when it forced me to get the 8 pounds off,” Eisenberg, who is also an associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologist-heart-healthy-habits-rcna138372" target="_blank"&gt;previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acd8d2" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/weight-loss-after-40-rcna117617" target="_blank"&gt;Weight creep&lt;/a&gt; — or gradual weight gain year after year — is common as people age. But even modest weight gain between early adulthood and middle age &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/gaining-just-5-22-pounds-age-55-can-hurt-your-t114042" target="_blank"&gt;can hurt health&lt;/a&gt;, raising the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity-related cancer and dying early, studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45b215" class="body-graf"&gt;So Eisenberg devised a sustainable weight-loss plan that’s helped him keep calories in check and avoid feeling deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-512784" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiologist Tip of the Day: Try the 'Work Diet'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-442c8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Eisenberg keeps his weight stable by following what he calls “the work diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4663d2" class="body-graf"&gt;The rules are simple: He eats as nutritiously as possible during his work hours Monday through Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6cfa02" class="body-graf"&gt;For him, that means combining breakfast and lunch, a type of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-lose-weight-intermittent-fasting-16-8-diet-t132608" target="_blank"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, and waiting until 11 a.m. to have a protein-rich snack, such as a Greek yogurt, a scoop of tuna fish or a hard-boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e268f1" class="body-graf"&gt;If someone in the office brings donuts, pizza or Chinese food, he skips it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-568137" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-501562" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people spend at least half of their waking hours at work. If you can prioritize a healthy diet for such a big chunk of the day, you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-07f243" class="body-graf"&gt;And if you’re going to treat yourself to decadent or sweet foods, keep in mind you won’t enjoy them very much in a busy work setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-458bf3" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’ll make me happy for like four minutes and I’m back to work stress,” Eisenberg says. “Only eat food when you could enjoy it, like later at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7e17cf" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46dc83" class="body-graf"&gt;When at work, eat the healthiest diet possible, including &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/heart-healthy-foods-rcna122367" target="_blank"&gt;heart-healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; such as nuts, seeds, yogurt, berries, dark leafy greens, and cold-water fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring and sardines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-855b36" class="body-graf"&gt;Eisenberg then eats whatever he wants for dinner and whatever he wants on the weekends — though that still means following the heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d60a0f" class="body-graf"&gt;The eating plan focuses on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-covid-symptoms-sore-throat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the symptoms of the new Nimbus COVID-19 variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong confirmed that no surprising wild card symptoms have yet been reported for NB.1.8.1 — they’re the same COVID-19 symptoms you’re used to hearing about from previous variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the one symptom that doctors are hearing about from patients is the very painful throat that’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;earned the unfortunate nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/1ldvned/new_razor_blade_throat_covid_subvariant_quickly/"&gt;as Reddit commenters have described it&lt;/a&gt;, “like being burned by acid whenever I ate or drank something” and “like my throat was coated in broken glass.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Nimbus, a descendent of the omicron variant that first emerged in 2021, causing such sore throats? “I think omicron in general prioritizes the upper respiratory tract instead of the getting into the lungs as much,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989396/"&gt;One 2022 study from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; found that a higher proportion of patients — up to 70% of those studied — reported sore throats when infected with the the omicron variant compared with earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous variants to reach the Bay Area, Chin-Hong noted that more people also now appear to experience non-respiratory symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting when they get COVID-19 — gastrointestinal symptoms that folks can often initially dismiss as being unrelated to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/"&gt;this is the full list of the possible symptoms of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New loss of taste or smell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congestion or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you might have a combination of these symptoms or just one. They might be mild or feel more severe. But if you’re experiencing any of these, take a COVID-19 test (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-razor-blade-throat-medicine-remedy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so how can I soothe my ‘razor blade throat’ if I’m infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of severe sore throat, it might be tempting to focus on topical medicine for your throat itself. But in general, systemic therapies — treatments which enter through your bloodstream, like Advil, and affect your whole body — “are better than topical ones,” said Chin-Hong. His recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen (like Advil) is better than acetaminophen (like Tylenol) in this case, he said, although you should check with your health provider if you have other medical conditions which might make taking ibuprofen. If your throat hurts too much to swallow a pill, you can consider liquid versions of these drugs, but make sure you use the right dose depending on age, said Chin-Hong.  And if you’re using a combination cold remedy like Nyquil, be aware it might already  contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen — and be careful not to accidentally double-dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could try warm remedies like chicken soup, broth, lemon tea, honey or cold ones like popsicles, ice cream or ice chips. The upside of these treatments is the immediate relief they can bring, but they might also not last as long. You could also try gargling salt water,  “which may loosen mucus” said Chin-Hong, or sucking lozenges with menthol or a mild anesthetic like benzocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental treatments to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong also recommends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke or expose yourself to smoke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider a humidifier, as dryness may make your symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you should consider seeking medical attention if your symptoms last longer than a week, if your sore throat is very severe, and if you begin drooling or become unable to eat or drink, said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="covidcasesbayarea"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the current COVID-19 cases in the Bay Area right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual “COVID cases” — that is, positive test results — are not tracked in the way they once were by local and state public health bodies. In the absence of widespread up-to-date data on positive test results, watching for the presence of the coronavirus in human sewage has become increasingly important for gauging the levels of COVID-19 spread in a particular area. This is because if you have COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1963120/one-way-to-monitor-a-communitys-coronavirus-infections-raw-sewage"&gt;the virus will show up in your feces &lt;/a&gt;soon after you’re infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While COVID-19 levels in the Bay Area’s wastewater have been slowly increasing since late spring, there’s “no statistically significant trend upwards at the moment,” said Bidwell from WastewaterSCAN. The Bay Area’s wastewater sites that Stanford monitors are currently in the “medium” category, she said, and “concentrations are on average lower where they were this time last year,” when &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11987343/covid-bay-area-wastewater-variant-symptoms-isolation-guidance"&gt;the Bay Area experienced a summer surge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-variants-vaccines-work"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Is the latest COVID-19 vaccine still effective against the new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine that rolled out in August 2024 &lt;/a&gt;is effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant, said Chin-Hong. “It’s a descendant of JN.1, which all the last year’s vaccines were based on, which we still have around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;get your COVID-19 shot in the fall, Chin-Hong has a message&lt;/a&gt;: Go get one now, particularly if you plan to traveling abroad this summer. Not only will your protection last roughly a year, he said, “getting it now if it’s being paid for would help that person navigate through what we might see in the summer, but also later on in the year if rules change” — referring to the widespread uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;how President Donald Trump’s administration might further change the U.S.’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;Currently, the CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for most adults 18 and older&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most health insurance companies should cover the costs for people will insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="covid-incubationperiod-2025"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think I was exposed, or have symptoms. When should I take a COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Know about updated incubation times for NB.1.8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard that incubation times for the virus are getting shorter — that is, the amount of time between getting exposed to COVID-19 and testing positive — it’s true. People are testing positive more quickly than they were in 2020, when the average incubation period was five to seven days, because it has changed with each new variant, said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days is a common period of time between exposure and getting sick, said Chin-Hong, and given this trend it makes sense to take a COVID-19 test as early as two days after exposure if you’re already having symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="covid-incubation-period"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Don’t trust a negative early COVID-19 test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your first test is negative, you should absolutely test again the next day if symptoms persist — and again after that if you’re still negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why you can’t necessarily trust a negative at-home COVID-19 test in 2025: While incubation times have gotten shorter, doctors are seeing people take longer to get a positive test, Chin-Hong said, and that’s probably more to do with how much quicker someone with COVID-19 might develop &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; in 2025 than they would have done in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, those symptoms are the sign that your body’s immune system is mounting a response to an invading virus. Back at the start of the pandemic, by the time you developed COVID-19 symptoms and took a test, it would probably already be positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at this stage of the pandemic, “we likely have more immune cells circulating that can recognize the enemy, so it ‘sounds the alarm’ quicker [and] people might feel something faster than in the old days,” said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, also put it this way for NPR in 2024: “With our immune systems primed, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/07/1222847727/coronavirus-faq-my-partner-roommate-kid-got-covid-and-i-didnt-how-come"&gt;the body’s response [now] comes much more quickly than it would have back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; when SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because many of us take a COVID-19 test when we &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to feel sick, we might actually be testing way too early for an at-home antigen kit to successfully detect enough virus inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: If you’re testing because you’ve started feeling unwell, don’t assume a negative result means you don’t actually have COVID-19. Play it safe, stay home as much as you can and wear a well-fitted mask if you can’t. Take another antigen test 48 hours later, Chin-Hong said. You can also seek out a PCR test, which are more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Make sure your COVID-19 test hasn’t expired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those COVID-19 tests you might have in a drawer may be approaching their expiration date if they haven’t already passed it. And an expired test could give you an unreliable result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;You can check the FDA’s list of antigen test types &lt;/a&gt;to see &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;whether the box you’re holding has had its shelf life extended&lt;/a&gt; by the manufacturer. The FDA said that if a test’s shelf life has been extended, it’s because the manufacturer has given the agency enough “data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.” (In other words, it’s still OK to use that test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip from Chin-Hong: “A quick and dirty way” to know if you’re using a functional COVID-19 test is to make sure the control line turns positive. If that doesn’t happen, “that means the test is probably not working,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="freecovidtests"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where can I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find a free COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a quick, free COVID-19 test — whether an at-home antigen test or a PCR test — has gotten progressively harder at this stage of the pandemic as more sites and services have been shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And visiting &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;the White House site that once offered you free at-home COVID-tests&lt;/a&gt; through USPS will now greet you with an image of Trump superimposed over the headline “LAB LEAK: The True Origins of COVID-19,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/18/g-s1-61324/lab-leak-white-house-covid-origins"&gt;a page dedicated to the theory disputed by many scientists&lt;/a&gt; that the pandemic was caused by the coronavirus leaking from a government laboratory in Wuhan, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do now if you don’t already have a supply of antigen tests for COVID-19 at home right now? Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purchase a COVID-19 at-home antigen test at a pharmacy near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest option will also be one of the most expensive up-front: Purchasing an at-home antigen test at a nearby pharmacy. (Ideally, ask someone to purchase one for you so you don’t potentially expose other people at the pharmacy, and if you really have to go yourself, wear a well-fitted N95 mask to help lower the risk you pose to others.) These at-home test kits are usually around $20 for a pack of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11969300/how-to-get-reimbursed-for-at-home-covid-tests-in-2023"&gt;request reimbursement from your health insurer for the cost of up to eight at-home tests per month&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t throw away your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Find a COVID-19 PCR testing site near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR testing is more accurate than an antigen test. It’s more sensitive at picking up traces of the coronavirus in your body, but it may take longer to get your results than with an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are still some sites offering free COVID-19 testing around the state. Try visiting &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/testing.html"&gt;MyTurn.ca.gov/testing&lt;/a&gt; and applying the “Free Sites” filter from the drop-down menu. You can also find&lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt; a health center near you &lt;/a&gt;and ask if they offer COVID-19 testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/Search"&gt;The CDC’s COVID-19 test locator&lt;/a&gt; is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you may be able to get a PCR test ordered by your health care provider with the costs covered. Having a test ordered by a provider is — usually — the only way to get your testing costs covered if you have Medicare, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you have health insurance, contact your provider&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re insured through major Bay Area providers like Kaiser Permanente or Sutter Health, the easiest way to get a COVID-19 test may be to make an appointment through your provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most providers offer sign-ups online through a member login and appointments can also be made by phone.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d started to feel discomfort right before I knew he was going to finish, and I knew immediately what that meant — a couple of days of pain, exacerbated by a neurological condition I suffer from — but I’d long been conditioned to ignore pain if it benefits men. I wanted this new guy to feel good, too. He left shortly after we finished. I didn’t want to be alone, but the “rules of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/tiktok-videos-single-women-crying.html"&gt;modern dating&lt;/a&gt;” often interfere with what I need as a &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/06/choosing-celibacy-as-survival.html"&gt;trauma survivor&lt;/a&gt;. That happens a lot; all of the “shoulds” around relationships and sex we’re supposed to care about, like being likable or focusing our lives on finding a partner, go out the window when compared to the impact of trauma. Since most people I’ve dated or slept with aren’t following the trauma survivor rules, though, I often try to appear normal, chill, like somebody who would be easier to be with than maybe I actually am.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7xz7001l3b774j3v0j2c@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;The guy I was sleeping with knew about my trauma history, and I had asked him to check in with me if we slept together, telling him it made me feel safer. Whether or not a partner is understanding of how trauma affects me can mean the difference between &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/sex-sabbatical-husband-marriage.html"&gt;a positive sex life&lt;/a&gt; and total incompatibility. Sometimes it’s harder for me to explain the link between pain that wasn’t caused by violence and a trauma response. If something was an accident, why should it bother me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y14001m3b77q6gcrbax@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;Sitting on the cold kitchen floor, I kept glancing over at my phone, hoping he would text me to ask how I was doing. I had been in an abusive relationship during which I was punished for being in discomfort and “inconveniencing” that partner, and I was still afraid to bring up pain. I felt more comfortable sharing that I was in pain if explicitly asked. My phone vibrated on the ground next to me, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. I picked up my phone, opened his text, and froze. He wasn’t checking in on me; he was ending things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y3r001n3b77tq3vffie@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;In the days that followed, I was upset about the end of a potential relationship, the loss of somebody I had enjoyed being around. But I wasn’t able to articulate the part that felt the worst, the most tender wound: how vulnerable I felt, in pain from sex with a person who failed to recognize my needs despite how clearly I communicated them. I was on the floor with nobody to help me up — literally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y5h001o3b77iucmlt1f@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Experiencing pain related to sex may feel familiar to sexual-assault survivors. However pain manifests, and regardless of whether it was caused directly by sexual activity, it can be a trigger, cause isolation, and fracture otherwise positive relationships if communication breaks down. Sometimes, our bodies register pain from consensual sex as threatening, and we become afraid of our own bodies. Physical pain can cause a second wave of emotional pain that may become even more difficult to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y7h001p3b779v71t13t@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;One survivor I spoke with described that when she felt pain, no matter how slight, during sex, it became intolerable. I’ve heard from many survivors with similar stories: Newly aware of pain during sex, they began experiencing more pain than before their assaults. Another survivor explained that experiencing intense physical pain during her assault meant pain during sex was a deal-breaker. Diagnosable disorders like vaginismus affect trauma survivors, but even accidental, one-off painful experiences can be triggering.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y98001q3b77wi60g8z3@published" data-word-count="157"&gt;For me, pain &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; to sex but not necessarily during it can be just as much of a trigger. I experienced medical complications after getting my first IUD, and I spent a night in the emergency room, thinking to myself the whole time: &lt;em&gt;I’m in this much pain because I’d decided to get birth control&lt;/em&gt;. The recovery from that medical experience affected my decisions about sex in the months that followed. I held back. I stopped exercising for months because I was afraid of triggering pain. Any touch from my partner felt threatening because I didn’t know where it would lead — not because he wasn’t trustworthy, but because I didn’t trust my own body. Today, going to the gynecologist or discussing health-care choices related to my sexual health proves triggering without exception. I am sensitive to where doctors’ hands are during exams, even if I have consented to the exam in general. Stray touch is intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yc8001r3b7785pkgzbz@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;A lot of outside beliefs are tied to what we feel we “should” or “shouldn’t” feel when having sex, physically or emotionally. After sexual assault, more than one therapist recommended I explore my sexuality through masturbation — as a test, before trying on my sexuality around a partner. The few mainstream books that referenced sexual healing post-assault similarly underscored the idea that masturbation is a key step toward sexual recovery and confidence if I ever wanted to seek out sex with another person. Basically, I was inundated with the idea that before I could sleep with somebody else, I had to sleep with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yee001s3b77zu49f123@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;I have early childhood memories of exploring my body, but at the time I was raped at 18, I did not regularly masturbate. Looking back, I think I was avoiding it because I associated the physical act with an aspect of sexual abuse I experienced as a young kid. My body didn’t feel safe to me in general, and I didn’t respond to sexual stimuli when I was alone as positively as when I got turned on when I was with somebody else. When my therapist suggested I read a book that highlighted masturbation as a key to sexual healing, I nodded along. But I didn’t start masturbating regularly until years later, after I’d broken up with a longtime boyfriend. I got the first vibrator that actually worked for me and spent some time exploring on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7ygd001t3b778tct3yo1@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;At that point, thrust back into the world of being single, dating, and figuring out how to trust new people, masturbation felt like a safe escape from potential trauma symptoms that would come up with new people. When I was alone, I was in control, and I felt less pressure to go out and date or sleep with anybody else if I could satisfy myself sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yi0001u3b77puwvaw11@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Even when I started having casual sex regularly, or later got into relationships, I have continued masturbating. It helps me feel in control of my sex drive, makes me relax and refocus when I’m stressed, and is a reliable source of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yms001v3b77mx00i2kc@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;Over the years, I’ve noticed a pattern: My relationship with masturbation has developed independently from my relationship with sex with partners. The two are separate, not sequential. I hope other trauma survivors can avoid the pressure I felt to explore masturbation as a prerequisite to sex with somebody else. Pleasure alone for its own sake is worth pursuing and doesn’t have to be tied to whether we’re ready for sex with a partner. And if you do have a partner, that doesn’t mean you have to abandon pursuing sex solo, whether that’s through masturbating, watching porn, or whatever feels safe and satisfying to you. By honoring your relationship with your own body, you’re actually setting yourself up to have a better relationship with a partner — who hopefully has a strong relationship with their body too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yom001w3b77oj11m318@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;By exploring alone, some survivors have restructured their approach to sexual pleasure. They focus on sustaining and increasing pleasure rather than reaching orgasm. It’s not that people &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t &lt;/em&gt;orgasm during sex, it’s just that it doesn’t have to be the end goal. (And sometimes, making sex about a goal at all can feel upsetting.) Survivors often carry this philosophy forward into sexual relationships with other people. On the other hand, some survivors told me that centering a sexual experience around orgasm is empowering for them and communicates a clear message: &lt;em&gt;My satisfaction comes first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yqa001x3b77bpyqmy2r@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;But sometimes satisfying is out of reach, like if our fight-or-flight is too high or we’re sleeping with a new person. Many survivors search for a sense of safety beyond anything else — if sex feels safe, it is good, regardless of whether it is satisfying. We get to set our own goals, and if our main or sole goal is safety, that is just as worthwhile as having an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers identified three broad strategies and 45 distinct ways that people try to break up with their partners. They found that most people try to do so gently, explaining their reasons and hoping for an amicable separation, while only a few disappear abruptly or end the relationship through indirect means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many studies have examined why people break up, few have looked closely at how breakups happen, especially within the context of a specific culture. The researchers aimed to fill this gap by focusing on people in Greece. They also wanted to understand if certain personality traits influenced the strategies people used to end relationships, with a special focus on traits like agreeableness and a set of less well-regarded characteristics known as the Dark Triad: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will experience the end of an intimate relationship (usually several times), with either themselves or their partners initiating it. Because this phenomenon is relatively common and painful, I was motivated to ask how people actually do so, which the current research aimed to address,” said study author &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/menelaosapostolou/Menelaos-Apostolou" target="_blank"&gt;Menelaos Apostolou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Nicosia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two studies. In the first, 228 Greek-speaking adults (122 women and 105 men) were asked to imagine themselves in an unhappy relationship and write down how they would end it. The participants came from a range of ages, averaging about 30 years old for women and 31 years old for men. The researchers then reviewed the participants’ responses, grouped similar answers together, and ended up with 45 distinct ways people might break up with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study involved 392 participants (185 women, 201 men, two identifying as ‘other’, and four choosing not to specify) with an average age of roughly 34 for women and 38 for men. These participants were asked how likely they were to use each of the 45 breakup methods. To measure their personalities, participants also completed questionnaires assessing traits associated with the Big Five theory — openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism — as well as Dark Triad traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers grouped the 45 breakup methods into nine strategies. These included approaches like “cold and distant” (gradually pulling away), “explain the reasons” (offering a direct and honest conversation), “ghosting” (disappearing with no notice), “take the blame” (ending the relationship while accepting responsibility), “have been unfaithful” (citing infidelity or interest in someone else), “take some time off” (requesting a break), “see you as a friend” (offering friendship), “we’d be better off apart” (explaining that separation is best), and “avoid ending it face to face” (using a phone call or text).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then discovered that these nine approaches fit into three broader strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most popular approach was “soften the blow,” used by roughly 86 percent of people surveyed. This method combined acts like explaining the reasons for the breakup, accepting some or all of the blame, and trying to convince the partner that separating would benefit both people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second approach was “take a break,” used by about 24 percent of people. Here, the person ending the relationship suggests a temporary separation, allowing both parties to assess their feelings and decide if the relationship should continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The least common approach was “avoid confrontation,” used by roughly 16 percent of people, in which someone disappears or becomes distant until the relationship quietly ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People employ three main strategies to end an intimate relationship,” Apostolou told PsyPost. “The most preferred one is ‘Soften the blow,’ involving explaining the breakup reasons, taking responsibility, and convincing the partner that separation is beneficial for both. The second most preferred one is ‘Take a break,’ where individuals express a desire for a temporary separation to reassess feelings. ‘Avoid confrontation,’ involving gradually fading away or disappearing without explanation, is the least preferred strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how these strategies connected to the participants’ personality traits. They found only a few significant connections. Individuals higher in agreeableness, a trait associated with kindness and consideration for others, were less likely to use the “cold and distant” approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those with higher levels of Machiavellianism, associated with manipulativeness, were more inclined to use this approach. Meanwhile, participants with higher levels of psychopathy, a trait linked with impulsivity and a lack of empathy, were more prone to blame their partner for the breakup. In general, personality characteristics had little bearing on which strategies people used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that, regardless of sex, age, or most personality traits, people tend to adopt fairly predictable ways of ending relationships. “I was expecting to find more pronounced sex, age, and personality differences in people’s willingness to use each of the identified strategies, but these differences were very small or inexistent,” Apostolou said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also hint at the role of social norms and evolved behavior. Humans have long depended on intimate connections for survival and reproduction, making breakups potentially dangerous in the ancestral environment. By employing strategies that reduce conflict, individuals might have improved their long-term prospects for finding a new partner and maintaining their social reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides a thorough examination of how people end relationships, it has some limitations. All the participants were Greek-speaking, making it unclear if these findings apply to other cultures. The data also came from self-reports, which can be influenced by memory or a desire to present oneself in a certain way. The sample was recruited online, making it challenging to generalize the results to the wider population. Additionally, the study only focused on how people say they would end relationships, not what they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The phenomenon is complex,” Apostolou noted. “A single piece of research gives only a general idea about how people end an intimate relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could investigate how these strategies work in practice and whether certain approaches lead to better outcomes for both partners. It might also be worth exploring how other factors, such as attachment styles or cultural background, shape the ways people end relationships. Understanding these dynamics could help counselors and therapists guide clients through breakups in ways that minimize harm, especially when children are involved or when future interaction is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My ultimate objective is to understand how intimate relationships work,” Apostolou explained. “An important step in this direction is to understand the interactions between intimate partners, and the present research falls within this objective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113273" target="_blank"&gt;Soften the blow, avoid confrontation, take a break: Three strategies that people use to terminate an intimate relationship&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Menelaos Apostolou and Antonios Kagialis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQT1pYVzcxTHg0c1p0NXdTek9QNXltaXBQeXJZQmRncWthTTZ2VHAtTzFKNzl6R0pIVUdKTjFkZGtYaFgyWm5yVTZyQTFiazdTUl9oWUt2REVGRVphNHhDcks4bkpwQTFKQVM3MV9qUHJQWjBkZDlZOHhpR2pESXE5ajlyVldCT1R5WUttb2ZVa0VsbnV6N1B4bjgzai1zdEU3cjR4SFBnNi03RjB2NGNjMHRWZ1paQQ</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州麻疹发病率上升：今年迄今为止的病例数超过2024年全年-《洛杉矶时报》 | Measles on the rise in California: More cases so far this year than all of 2024 - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxQdHc0Um9panlwVEVzV2ZMVWY5Vzl6NHdlQkhPTEEtel9iaU1uTE5PTTV3TWQxXzFqZmI5V093TXJVdXNBRG55NnhaMF9wSG10Y0R0TUQxUkRpSFc4VzIyVW5wRm5ZOVk4eElzYzBHVmt5c1JkYkJNeU9ZdXQtV05tNm4wVHItU1pqWGl3dUF6NVBKdmtUdnZzcEIzajdNWFJVSk14cmdjQzhhemptMVhMR0lGY0d5dDAzWWFYeEhQV2NWMjBoYi1nSU4wZThyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California has already reported more measles cases this year than in all of 2024, a worrisome development that comes as the nation is suffering its largest outbreak of the super-infectious disease in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the national outbreak has rocketed measles from a back-of-mind issue — one rarely, if ever, encountered by a whole generation of Americans — to a pressing public health concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is completely preventable,” Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uptick in confirmed measles cases in California, while still somewhat concerning for local public health officials, pales compared  with the significant outbreak that began in Texas earlier this year and has since spread to surrounding states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has reported at least 750 measles cases; New Mexico, 81; Kansas, 80; North Dakota, 28; and Montana, 23, according to the respective states’ health departments. Michigan has reported 15 cases; Ohio and Illinois, 10, and Arkansas and Indiana, eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spreading almost universally among people who either haven’t been vaccinated, or whose vaccination status is not known, authorities note. But the MMR shots, so named because they also afford protection against mumps and rubella, has long &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-24/anti-vaccination-forces-fight-california-vaccine-legislation"&gt;been in the crosshairs&lt;/a&gt; of anti-vaccine activists and skeptics — some of whom &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;are now in charge&lt;/a&gt; of shaping U.S. policy regarding childhood immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 17 cases of measles reported so far this year among California residents, up from the 15 reported all of last year, according to the state Department of Public Health. Doctors have been increasingly on alert for measles, which for decades has been so rare that many physicians haven’t encountered a single case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of that recent rarity, many may be unfamiliar with how readily measles can spread — or the serious symptoms it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not just a mild childhood disease,” Dr. Erica Pan,  director of the California Department of Public Health and state public health officer, said in a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/ftMPCRkOqAQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1226" target="_blank"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; to doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has a death rate of  1 for every 500 to 1,000 cases, Pan said. Nationwide, more than 145 people have been hospitalized with measles so far this year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;federal data show&lt;/a&gt;, and many of those hospitalized have needed intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can cause very severe disease — often causes a viral pneumonia that is severe enough to need intensive care,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;   &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Rong-Gong Lin II, Mark E.

It is so infectious you can catch it just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after they left, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of the measles cases are associated with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; tied to close-knit communities with low rates of vaccination, according to the CDC. Recent outbreaks have occurred in areas with a notable population of &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c" target="_blank"&gt;certain Mennonite Christian communities&lt;/a&gt;, starting last fall in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to a large gathering in New Brunswick; then in &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and New Mexico in late January; and more recently in the Mexican state of &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-measles-vaccines-misinformation-mmr-mennonites-misinformation-ea6158b9a4d513b20f33cbc09034e5c2" target="_blank"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AP reported that officials in Mexico and the U.S. say the outbreaks in their countries &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-new-mexico-kansas-vaccine-e904ec9781f1d164c73afe4ab71774fe" target="_blank"&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the strain found in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that 95% of this year’s measles cases in the U.S. occurred among people who were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. About 29% of cases occurred in children younger than 5, with an additional 37% in those age 5 to 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the U.S. has reported 1,227 confirmed measles cases so far this year. That’s already rivaling the highest single-year total seen this century — 1,274 were reported in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would have to look back a generation to find a higher total than that: 2,126 cases were reported nationwide in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And those are probably an underreporting,” Pan said of this year’s case count. Doctors, she said, have learned that most people affected by the measles outbreaks are reluctant to get themselves or their children tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three measles deaths have been reported so far this year, according to the CDC. Two were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; school-aged children — both of whom were unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, according to state health officials. The other was an unvaccinated adult in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; who didn’t seek medical care before dying, according to health authorities there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One death has been reported in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. That person was also unvaccinated. More than 3,300 confirmed and suspected measles cases have also been reported in &lt;a class="link" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One infant, who was infected with measles before being born premature, died in Canada earlier this month, according to Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer for the province of Ontario. The infant’s mother was not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus, but measles “may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death,” Moore said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year marks the first time a child has died from measles in the United States since 2003 — and the child in that case had a rare genetic condition that impaired the immune system. It’s also the first time since the 1990s that more than two people have died from measles in the U.S. in a single year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most associated with its telltale rash, health officials warn measles can cause symptoms that cross the boundary from discomfort to danger. Measles can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. And years after contracting measles, people can later develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-measles-sspe-20150624-story.html"&gt;SSPE&lt;/a&gt;, a rare but fatal complication resulting from a weakened form of the virus remaining in the body, and later infecting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really, really unusual time to see this many deaths — and seeing previously healthy children with a vaccine-preventable death in the United States,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can also cause something called “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” “It can actually suppress people’s immune systems for a few years after having that measles infection,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreaks in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-vaccination-pep-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1536#:~:text=Infants%206%20through%2011%20months%20receive%20an%20early%20dose%20of,through%206%20years%20of%20age." target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/publication/view/guide/9193/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; are so severe that state health officials are recommending early vaccination in babies as young as 6 months in the hardest-hit counties. Those officials are also recommending a second dose for many children earlier than the typical schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard CDC recommendation is that children receive the first of two measles vaccine shots when they turn 1, unless they are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;traveling internationally&lt;/a&gt;, in which case they can get vaccinated at 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, there is no active measles outbreak, so there’s no recommendation for additional or accelerated vaccine doses, Pan said. Most of California’s measles cases this year have involved people who traveled internationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping matters is California’s relatively high vaccination rate among kindergartners. For the 2023-24 school year, 96.2% of California’s kindergartners were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-25/measles-confirmed-in-l-a-county-resident-who-recently-returned-from-texas"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against measles, according to the CDC — one of the higher rates of any state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest figure is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity"&gt;down slightly&lt;/a&gt; from the 96.5% seen the year earlier, but it remains above the levels seen prior to 2014-15, when a severe measles outbreak linked to Disneyland prompted state legislators to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ln-governor-signs-tough-new-vaccination-law-20150630-story.html"&gt;strengthen&lt;/a&gt; vaccination requirements for children who attend school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aim for a 95% vaccination rate for measles to guard against outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, California’s measles case rate remains much lower than the national rate. But that doesn’t mean the state is invulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are settings in which unvaccinated people can cluster together, such as group outings of children who are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-23/independent-study-charter-schools-are-a-soft-spot-in-californias-vaccine-laws-data-show"&gt;homeschooled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerable setting can be doctor’s offices. In 2008, an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-vaccine2-2008may02-story.html"&gt;returned home to&lt;/a&gt; San Diego from a trip to Switzerland, became sick, then went to school and was taken to the pediatrician. Investigators found that measles then spread to 11 other children who were either unvaccinated or too young to be vaccinated — five in his school, four who were in the pediatrician’s office at the same time he was, and both of his siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those infected were three infants younger than 1, one of whom was hospitalized for two days, according to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5708a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC. Another infant traveled by plane to Hawaii while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some California counties also have measles vaccination rates for kindergartners that are below the 95% goal. For the 2023-24 school year, San Diego County’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity"&gt;rate&lt;/a&gt; is 94.8%; San Bernardino County’s is 93.5%; Santa Cruz County’s is 91.8%; and Kern County’s is 90.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a measles outbreak in Los Angeles County was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-measles-20170120-story.html"&gt;centered&lt;/a&gt; in an Orthodox Jewish community, with a number of patients living in Westside L.A., the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. In early 2019, California’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-measles-outbreak-la-20190429-story.html"&gt;biggest measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; was in Butte County, and started after a man visited the Philippines, a country that was then in the midst of a massive outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time measles caused scores of deaths nationwide was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1989 to 1991, there were about 55,000 cases and more than 130 suspected measles-associated deaths, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, that epidemic was the worst between 1988 and 1991 — with 18,000 cases, 3,500 hospital admissions and 70 deaths reported, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1307555/?page=1" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials&lt;/a&gt;. A big problem officials identified at that time was that poor parents could not afford vaccinations for their children. One of the nation’s largest outbreaks in 1989 involved mostly preschool-aged children in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001632.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the outbreak, the CDC’s Advisory &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;Committee&lt;/a&gt; on Immunization Practices &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00038256.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; a second dose of the measles vaccine be given between the ages of 4 and 6. And in the early 1990s, the federal government &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/vfc.html#:~:text=The%20VFC%20program%20was%20authorized,operational%20on%20October%201%2C%201994." target="_blank"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; the Vaccines for Children program, which funds a number of vaccinations for children with low-income parents. In 2000, officials &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that measles was no longer being continuously transmitted locally in the U.S., and new cases were only found when someone was infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County has recorded four cases of measles so far this year among residents, up from one all of last year. Most of the cases this year were associated with someone who either traveled internationally or to domestic areas suffering community transmission of measles, according to the local Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also two reported cases among non-county residents this year, including an &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=4971&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; traveling through Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-25/measles-confirmed-in-l-a-county-resident-who-recently-returned-from-texas"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; who was returning home to &lt;a class="link" href="https://ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-0" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were six non-L.A. County residents who had measles while traveling through L.A. County; four had traveled through Los Angeles International Airport while infectious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With measles cases rising across the country and globally, it’s important for unprotected individuals to consider preventive measures. Immunization provides the best protection. Additionally, anyone who was exposed should monitor for symptoms,” the Orange County Health Care Agency said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes. People can be contagious from about four days before the rash begins through four days afterward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those suspecting they have measles should call their medical provider before they go to the doctor’s office to avoid potentially exposing other patients, the Health Care Agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash traditionally starts at the hairline and moves its way down the body, according to Pan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser has seen one case of measles this past month, which was in the Santa Clarita area, Hudson said. Health officials said people were possibly &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=5059&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; to the contagious individual at a Costco, Trader Joe’s and Walmart on the afternoon of May 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, has an excellent safety record. Hundreds of millions of children have safely received the vaccine worldwide,” she said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQdHc0Um9panlwVEVzV2ZMVWY5Vzl6NHdlQkhPTEEtel9iaU1uTE5PTTV3TWQxXzFqZmI5V093TXJVdXNBRG55NnhaMF9wSG10Y0R0TUQxUkRpSFc4VzIyVW5wRm5ZOVk4eElzYzBHVmt5c1JkYkJNeU9ZdXQtV05tNm4wVHItU1pqWGl3dUF6NVBKdmtUdnZzcEIzajdNWFJVSk14cmdjQzhhemptMVhMR0lGY0d5dDAzWWFYeEhQV2NWMjBoYi1nSU4wZThyQQ</guid></item><item><title>哈勒奎因鱼鳞病：一种罕见的遗传性疾病，给婴儿带来坚硬的“鳞片” - Live Science | Harlequin ichthyosis: The rare genetic disease that gives babies hard 'scales' - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbkVpS2FfcWQ5bDQwSEltWmxMRWVmZWYyd1lMdzV1TGhTS0NXTW1sZ1BuWVZtcENGeW9uMTg4Zm0yYUZTODlQZFFHcS1UbHdKeEd6dmFwaG5iOHQzZ3pCcmdNazE2M0xSVWlpNjh6S2pobTZXOFZidkV1VkpkT1c1QlE0QjF5bklQODhFSW5Ba0dEbTR3VkpmSUFUUFdGV2VIYklrOUotQmNadWhLcWJtMXFxY2ltVlh6MmJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease name: &lt;/strong&gt;Harlequin ichthyosis, also called ichthyosis fetalis and harlequin baby syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected populations: &lt;/strong&gt;This genetic condition &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journaljpri.com/index.php/JPRI/article/view/4789" target="_blank" data-url="https://journaljpri.com/index.php/JPRI/article/view/4789" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;affects an estimated 1 in 300,000 live births&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; globally. In the United States, it's estimated to occur in about 1 in 500,000 births, or about seven births a year, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#affected" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#affected" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Organization for Rare Disorders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The condition seems to affect males and females in equal numbers and doesn't occur in greater frequency in any specific racial or ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes: &lt;/strong&gt;Harlequin ichthyosis is caused by a variety of mutations in a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/abca12/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/abca12/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABCA12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which carries instructions for proteins that ship molecules across cell membranes. These proteins are key for transporting fats and enzymes in the outermost layer of the skin, known as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/skin-facts-about-the-bodys-largest-organ-and-its-functions" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/skin-facts-about-the-bodys-largest-organ-and-its-functions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;epidermis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/harlequin-ichthyosis/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/harlequin-ichthyosis/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most people with harlequin ichthyosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; carry a genetic mutation that causes cells to make ABCA12 proteins that are too short and thus unable to properly transport fats. In some cases, people can't make the protein at all, which results in the most severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the condition is inherited in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#causes" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#causes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an autosomal recessive pattern&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a baby must inherit two copies of the broken gene — one from each parent — to develop the disorder. People with only one mutant copy of the gene are "carriers" but do not show symptoms. People with a family history of the disorder can consider seeking genetic counseling to see if they're a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; The transportation of fat molecules in the epidermis is important for keeping the skin hydrated, and it's also necessary for the skin to develop properly in the womb and after birth. When babies have ABCA12 proteins that are too short or totally absent, these infants are born with thick, platelike scales of skin, which cause the skin to be stretched very tightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tight skin cracks easily, forming fissures. The tension pulls at the affected baby's eyelids and lips, turning them inside out, and it also constricts the movement of the chest, which impedes breathing and eating. Poor nail and hair growth are also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies with harlequin ichthyosis are often born prematurely, and they may also show additional symptoms and traits, such as a flat nose, abnormal hearing, ears that are fused to their head, swollen hands and feet, and decreased joint mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition compromises the skin's protective barrier, leaving the infant vulnerable to dehydration and unable to regulate their temperature or fight infections well. For infants that survive the newborn period, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560492/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560492/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the "armor-like" plates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eventually shed and the remaining skin is very red, dry and scaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with harlequin ichthyosis often don't survive the newborn period, but with intensive medical care, it's possible for them to survive &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstskinfoundation.org/brenna-w" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.firstskinfoundation.org/brenna-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to later infancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, childhood and even early adulthood, in some cases. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://read.qxmd.com/read/21339420/harlequin-ichthyosis-a-review-of-clinical-and-molecular-findings-in-45-cases?redirected=slug" target="_blank" data-url="https://read.qxmd.com/read/21339420/harlequin-ichthyosis-a-review-of-clinical-and-molecular-findings-in-45-cases?redirected=slug" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report that reviewed 45 cases of the disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that about 55% of the patients survived the newborn period, with survivors ranging from 10 months to 25 years old at the time of survey. Common causes of death in the period shortly after birth included respiratory failure and/or sepsis, a dangerous body-wide immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no cure for harlequin ichthyosis, so care aims to manage the symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/harlequin-ichthyosis#management-and-treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/harlequin-ichthyosis#management-and-treatment" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, babies with the condition are cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth. There, they can be placed in high-humidity incubators to help regulate their temperature and skin hydration. They're also bathed often to soften and loosen the skin plaques, and exfoliating techniques might be used to help remove the scales. Moisturizers and skin barrier repair formulas can also help with the excessive skin dryness and stiffness. Various pain relievers can help make newborns more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, medications called retinoids may be used and are typically given orally. These drugs help to break down the thick, platelike scales covering the skin, which, in turn, may reduce other symptoms of the condition. However, these medications are conserved for severe cases because they can have toxic side effects if used over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics may be needed to prevent or counter skin infections. The eyes should also be lubricated regularly, as infants with the condition cannot close their eyelids properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discharged from the NICU, children with harlequin ichthyosis require ongoing skin care, as well as lifelong medical care to manage additional symptoms that may emerge due to their condition. This care usually requires a diverse team of medical specialists, including ophthalmologists, plastic surgeons, nutritionists, physical and occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj-3tAV2KfXE1dr2ZkWDEVeOAznq5dKFHtb" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj-3tAV2KfXE1dr2ZkWDEVeOAznq5dKFHtb slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
