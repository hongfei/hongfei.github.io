&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;Brent Chapman&lt;/strong&gt; first heard his doctor suggest surgically implanting one of his own &lt;strong&gt;teeth into his eye&lt;/strong&gt; to restore his vision, he admits he felt apprehensive. But after speaking to an Australian woman who had undergone the procedure and was now &lt;strong&gt;skiing&lt;/strong&gt; after 20 years of blindness, he knew he had to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Now, Chapman is part of history, as Canada performs its&lt;strong&gt; first-ever osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP),&lt;/strong&gt; also known as the &lt;strong&gt;tooth-in-eye surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This remarkable procedure is giving hope to patients with severe corneal blindness—people who, like Chapman, have run out of options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the surgery works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to CBC&lt;/a&gt;, The OOKP procedure is as unusual as it is groundbreaking. It is done in &lt;strong&gt;two stages&lt;/strong&gt;, months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;First, a tooth is extracted, reshaped, and fitted with a plastic optical lens. The tooth, usually a &lt;strong&gt;canine&lt;/strong&gt;, is selected because dentine is the &lt;strong&gt;hardest biological material&lt;/strong&gt; the human body produces, making it an ideal foundation for a lens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once modified, the prepared tooth is temporarily implanted into the patient’s &lt;strong&gt;cheek&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing it to develop&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blood vessels and soft tissue, which will help it integrate into the eye later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the patient’s eye is prepared for the transplant. Surgeons remove &lt;strong&gt;scar tissue from the cornea&lt;/strong&gt; and replace it with a small &lt;strong&gt;flap of tissue &lt;/strong&gt;from the inside of the cheek, which acts as a protective cover. This step is crucial, as it creates an environment in which the implanted tooth will function successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A few months later, the tooth-implant is removed from the cheek and&lt;strong&gt; sewn &lt;/strong&gt;into the front of the eye. The result is a &lt;strong&gt;pink eye with a small, black circular opening&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing the patient to see through the implanted lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use a tooth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of putting a tooth in an eye may sound bizarre, but there’s solid medical reasoning behind it. According to &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/strong&gt;, the ophthalmologist leading the Canadian surgeries, the dentine in teeth is uniquely strong and biocompatible, making it the perfect casing for a&lt;strong&gt; lens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike artificial implants, which often trigger &lt;strong&gt;immune rejection&lt;/strong&gt;, a patient’s own tooth is naturally accepted by the body. This dramatically increases the chances of long-term success—a crucial factor, given that &lt;strong&gt;94% of patients&lt;/strong&gt; in a 2022 Italian study maintained their vision for an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;average of&lt;strong&gt; 27 years&lt;/strong&gt; post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A last-resort procedure, but with life-changing results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tooth-in-eye&lt;/strong&gt; surgery is not a &lt;strong&gt;miracle cure&lt;/strong&gt; for all types of blindness. It is specifically designed for patients with corneal blindness due to autoimmune diseases, chemical burns, or severe scarring. The key requirement is that the retina and optic nerves must still be functional.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the complexity and intensity of the procedure, it is &lt;strong&gt;only performed on one eye&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, the surgery comes with &lt;strong&gt;risks&lt;/strong&gt;, including infections that could lead to total vision loss, surgical complications requiring additional operations, and, in rare cases, failure of the implant requiring removal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, for patients like Chapman, the risk-reward balance is clear. Having spent 20 years enduring over&lt;strong&gt; 50 eye surgeries&lt;/strong&gt;, with only temporary improvements, he is willing to bet everything on this last hope for sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

(Submitted by Phil Chapman)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada’s first tooth-in-eye surgery clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before now, Canadian patients needing OOKP surgery had to travel abroad. That is about to change. Dr. Moloney, who has already performed seven successful&lt;strong&gt; OOKP surgeries &lt;/strong&gt;in Australia, hopes to establish the first dedicated Canadian clinic at &lt;strong&gt;Mount Saint Joseph Hospital &lt;/strong&gt;in &lt;strong&gt;Vancouver&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;$430,000 &lt;/strong&gt;in donations from the St. Paul’s Foundation, the clinic will be funded for the first three years, after which Providence Health Care will integrate it into its annual budget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Samir Jabbour&lt;/strong&gt;, an ophthalmologist at the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, calls this a &lt;strong&gt;“great opportunity for Canadian medicine.”&lt;/strong&gt; He notes that while OOKP is rare, having the option available within Canada will significantly ease the burden on patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A second chance at life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Brent Chapman, the &lt;strong&gt;dream of sight&lt;/strong&gt; is within reach. If his final surgery succeeds, he looks forward to finally doing the things he once loved—playing basketball, traveling, and seeing the world again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, this will break some ground,” he says. “If others in Canada need this, and it becomes an established treatment, I’d feel really great about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And this is exactly why, not just those on the left, but many on the right, didn’t want this man to be in charge of any kind of health program. And this is what happens, Howie, when you have fear-mongering and you make science the enemy, and that’s what happened during COVID. So now we have men, women and children who will contract things like measles that were practically eradicated here in the United States and will die. We’ve already seen deaths, and there will be more. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="STUQVVP7U5GCJLPU4R7WZ4UW5E"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m not trying to be, you know, dramatic, but you know that these are the facts that we’re facing with or hearing from the medical community. And it’s shameful. Science is not political. Science is just that, and we need that, especially when it comes to health for the better health of our nation.

His top spokesman quit after two weeks because he didn’t like the way he was handling the measles business. But also, he’s just an oddball character, and that picture from California is just blatantly tone-deaf.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TITL42K56ND2HNT2BT2BSWUAK4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mary Katherine Ham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: Yeah, I think it is, and he should illustrate that he’s on top of this crisis in the proper way, if we were, you know, in normal times. But the idea from Leslie that science is not political, coming from a Democrat after COVID is, frankly, laughable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NWC4YSXF75G7LJF4F77YY2EYU4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HXQIJKT65B3TNUD2XJSQPDRUU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marshall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: I’m sorry, but it’s RFK Jr., it’s the Republicans that were demonizing vaccines, not Democrats, and that demonization of vaccines led to so many people choosing not to vaccinate themselves and their children, and that’s why we’re seeing people’s bodies being lowered into the ground with measle deaths, which is unheard of, that that I’m sorry I’m not put, can’t put that on my party. ...

   &lt;p&gt;Think of a time when someone did something really nice for you, or you did something really nice for them. Just bringing up that memory probably makes you feel good — about that person, the nice thing that happened and maybe about some other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jessica Borelli, a professor of psychological science at University of California, Irvine, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31999188/" target="_blank"&gt;has developed a technique&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on these kinds of memories to help people feel more secure in their relationships. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relational-Savoring-Reflection-Strengthen-Relationships/dp/1433840677" target="_blank"&gt;Relational savoring&lt;/a&gt; encourages clients to take a deep dive into these meaningful moments. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35549365/" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38533758/" target="_blank"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, it's been shown to be an effective intervention for strengthening family bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

He has spent decades trying to understand how we can intensify and extend the feelings we get from positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;This was a somewhat radical concept in psychology when Bryant began his research in the 1980s. There were plenty of people looking into coping, which is how we process negative experiences, but no one was doing the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was assumed if a good thing happened, you would feel happy. But we all know people who don't know how to enjoy themselves," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And we as humans tend to excel at finding the downside of any situation, Borelli adds. "Our brains are hardwired to think about negativity," she says. "That's probably because of evolution. We focus on where the smoke is coming from. But it doesn't leave time for us to think about positive moments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research has linked the practice of savoring with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27247114/" target="_blank"&gt;greater well-being&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27247114/" target="_blank"&gt;lower negative mood&lt;/a&gt;. It's part of &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/08/positive-emotions-your-health" target="_blank"&gt;a growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that accentuating positive emotions can be critical for your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you caught NPR's recent Stress Less series that explored several skills — including savoring — that when practiced for a few minutes a day &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5316220/blah-buoyant-skills-improve-mood-optimism-stress-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;help tamp down anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (If not, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-24355/stress-less" target="_blank"&gt;catch up on it here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.771698/full" target="_blank"&gt;understand these connections&lt;/a&gt; and how to take advantage of them, Bryant notes. But in the meantime, here are some ways to tap into the power of savoring for yourself and everyone you love.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Build up the anticipation&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first person to introduce Bryant to savoring was his mom, who was always planning what she called "joy adventures" when he was a kid. What Bryant learned was that even the mere idea of these experiences was fun, and looking forward to them allowed him to savor in advance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just like you might read a travel guidebook before boarding a plane to get in the mood for vacation, you can plan ahead for spending time with family and friends and get excited for whatever is on the agenda. "With my granddaughter, we make lists of what we're going to do together. Those are joy menus," says Bryant. He says he likes to leave a blank space "for the joy of surprise."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have a big family gathering to attend, you could choose to worry about whether your uncle will make tasteless jokes. Or, Borelli says, you could focus on the fact that it's a rare opportunity to get everyone together. "What are the most important things for you to get out of this experience?" she says. Coming into the event with a goal of creating lasting family memories will put you in the right mindset for actually being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Hop on a time machine&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of Bryant's favorite savoring techniques is to mentally fast-forward himself into the future. For example, when spending an afternoon with that 7-year-old granddaughter, he'll imagine it's 20 years later and she's all grown up. Then he tells himself that now he has the chance to go back to this moment, and what was already a special experience becomes imbued with even more meaning.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm approaching it as if it were a reality that is now gone," he says. "When you see it as a second chance, you savor it more."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even a not-so-pleasant experience, like dealing with a toddler tantrum, can transform when you view it as a blast from the past. "This is fleeting. It will not last," Bryant says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to learn better ways of managing stress? Sign up for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/stress-less" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Stress Less newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and get five advice-packed newsletters over five weeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Use all of your senses&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I listen to a piece of music, I close my eyes to focus on it," Bryant says. "I'll do that at a gathering with my family. I'm transported above the event and listen to the blend of voices, joy cascading through the moment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Catching every detail — how things look, sound, smell, taste and feel — makes it easier to recall memories later and relive that positive experience. "The first step in being able to savor something is to be attuned to what's happening," Borelli says. That's why the relational savoring intervention asks clients to set the scene when they discuss a memory. "It's everything they can remember, like a camera," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Borelli also recommends taking pictures, which you can share with others and turn into mementos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Remember to look back&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key to savoring, Bryant says, is that it requires effort. "You have to make time for it. Bad things force us to deal with them. We have little choice about coping," he explains. But we have to decide &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; savor and &lt;em&gt;what to&lt;/em&gt; savor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Borelli is helping clients find memories to explore, they often land on a moment that didn't seem that important at the time. For example, a kid falls down at a playground and the parent rushes over to hold them, offer comfort and wipe away tears. "As a parent, you don't get to pause and think that was special," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But those hugs can be an invaluable gift that helps kids feel more secure. She has parents reflect on what that experience means for their connection now and in the future, and if it brings up any thoughts about this relationship or any others in their lives. "This is where the magic happens," Borelli says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, hopefully, it helps lead them to more memories to savor down the road.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vickyhallett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vicky Hallett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer who regularly contributes to NPR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The nonprofit tracks health care quality and costs statewide and issued its &lt;a href="https://mncmsecure.org/website/Reports/Community%20Reports/Summary%20Report/2023MY_Summary%20Report_QDC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://mncmsecure.org/website/Reports/Community%20Reports/Summary%20Report/2023MY_Summary%20Report_QDC.pdf"&gt;annual update&lt;/a&gt; and clinic scores late last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The percentage of patients with optimized management of their diabetes is the highest since the measure was revised in 2017. Fourteen of 20 measures of clinical quality improved by significant margins in 2023, including the rates of screening patients when recommended for colon cancer and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Even a percentage point increase on these measures means hundreds or thousands more patients are receiving better care, said Jess Donovan, MNCM’s chief executive. “Every step forward counts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Despite the progress, Minnesota clinics fell below the state’s goal of keeping diabetes under control for at least 50% of their adult patients. Had clinics collectively met that target, another 14,000 Minnesotans would have had their diabetes in check, reducing risks for heart and kidney failure, eye damage and other complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Performance varied dramatically. Entira Family Clinics locations in the Twin Cities and Gundersen Health System clinics in southeast Minnesota kept 57% of adult patients with diabetes at optimal health. Patients meet this criteria if they have low blood sugar and blood pressure levels, refrain from smoking, and take aspirin and cholesterol-lowering drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center only achieved a 20% success rate by comparison. Results for the north Minneapolis provider were expected to be lower, around 37%, because it treats many low-income and uninsured patients who struggle to afford prescriptions and healthy foods that help control their diabetes. But the actual results fell below expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-0 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Many people had disrupted Medicaid health benefits in 2023, when the federal pandemic emergency declaration was lifted, so they were less likely to visit doctors and fill prescriptions they needed, said Dr. Kevin Gilliam, medical director for NorthPoint, which is operated in partnership with Hennepin County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:09:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOMDhEaWlpb2RyVG9ra1hNYUdwOERnUy1OUG1IalRQMWNkQU90NllJM0E4R1Bwb0hMd28tNHR5MmlpMnBTdGNxRm0zREQwVmEwTkJmMzk3RTgwa0xrSVo3VU9QLWM4eEZtZmlfMWl2aGZhWkxPVnd5U21mR0RjVDhtVlVfQ3hEYWhSb3pyaFk5SWFIUTlvTWRLY3AyUGpTSFk</guid></item><item><title>During the last major measles outbreaks in the US, it took extraordinary measures to stop the spread - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNZDEySGJzYkdHeUF1R2hZZG5hTFV3dXNVaE44bHV6TkVfSWl4UWlRNVNBR09TY1pPRDJBTWFWcGhXMXZGUEwwdjYzNlZsM3dlczFkZFZhNnhoNUZlYVVvQ1BLclBSbXk4aEN2dXVhRVZSOFhqQ0tYMzVEbW5McW5mcTRuYXhuQTdHYUd3b290U0pFZFVSREhqSHhaVdIBkgFBVV95cUxQcmpoUlZvSnFJRTlGS05udXpuVEJjeGJ0eGpTYXRkZjZ1R1NHNnZDbklsS2lpV2JfeEFJT3Nlb0lWT0JFMnhSNmJBREFHc2tMSW85TjhnY1owM0RFM0VoQk1PenRVbkZKalNVR3VpNVl2Y2NrczZKNGVYdXROeGJQbUpvNTN4ZWpFc1Baa0FGbUZ6QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Six years ago, two communities in New York – one in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County – were facing the worst measles outbreaks the United States had seen in decades. Measles had been declared eliminated from the country in 2000, but 2019 brought the nation the closest it has been to losing that status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00043b6m1n5skq61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zp5qm800013b6mgl7h4j1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Back in 2019, swift, sustained efforts to curb the measles virus brought the country back from the brink. The response centered on the unique needs of communities that were most at risk, powered by hands-on public health work that was supported by formal policy changes. Experts say the way the outbreak played out in New York underscores the importance of an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread in other outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zqx16q00093b6m0slo34h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreaks in New York, which started at the end of 2018 and persisted through most of 2019, were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zquo0g00073b6m79j8knwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health experts who were part of the on-the-ground response say that building trust within the community was perhaps the most important part of their work because it created opportunities to better utilize the most important tool available: vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00063b6mu90lai77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccination is the most important way to prevent the devastating disease that measles can be,” said Dr. Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source, a coalition of organizations focused on reducing risk from novel viruses. He was heavily involved in responding to the measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 as a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee working out of the New York City health department at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00073b6m304swctp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective at preventing disease, and immunity from the shot is long-lasting. Because measles is so contagious, federal health agencies say that a 95% vaccination rate is needed to prevent outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00083b6mylq5h799@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of people were vaccinated in New York during the outbreaks – at least 200,000 doses in New York City and about 30,000 in Rockland County, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/health/measles-outbreak-over-rockland-county-ny/index.html"&gt;officials told CNN&lt;/a&gt; was three times more than the annual baseline. Vaccine promotion efforts raised rates among young children in the Brooklyn neighborhoods affected by the outbreak from less than 80% to about 91%, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. But the process took time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00093b6mxx4slwn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were up against quite a bit of resistance in terms of getting people vaccinated as quickly as we would have liked,” said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, president and chief executive officer of the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit organization focused on improving health care in New York City. She was the city’s health commissioner during the measles outbreak between 2018 and 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000a3b6m7vdlzf5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it took more time than we would have anticipated, but that just really spoke to the degree of how hardened the disinformation had become in that community and what we were fighting against,” she said. “That’s why it’s so important to rely on trusted messengers to make it easy for people to get vaccinated and to have leaders that lead with the importance of vaccination. I can’t really overstate the importance of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000b3b6mahxl1xre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New York City also benefited from a strong vaccine registry that helped public health workers identify the people who were most at risk and focus their efforts, Vora said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000c3b6mcboahame@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my big concerns is that other jurisdictions in the country are not as well-resourced as we are in New York City, so when they face outbreaks, they’re going to have even more trouble than we had in getting those outbreaks under control,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000d3b6mj094a2in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The work required a highly individualized approach, with workers knocking directly on doors and making time to answer questions about vaccination one-on-one, Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000e3b6mtsfeqqvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There were certainly many people where we went to their homes to be vaccinated. There were instances where we went in essentially undercover, so that their neighbors wouldn’t know that they were getting vaccinated,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000f3b6mxxmgpx44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles vaccine can build immunity quickly – it takes just a few weeks to reach its full effectiveness – and the efforts in New York paid off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000g3b6mgi143ou8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A retrospective modeling &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4037" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that vaccination campaigns during the measles outbreak in New York City averted an even larger spike in cases. The outbreak could have been at least 10 times worse than it was, with up to 8,100 people infected instead of the 649 cases reported by the city, according to the report by Dr. Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000h3b6m208nhh4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But once an outbreak starts, experts say, increasing vaccination rates isn’t the only factor to consider. Findings from Yang’s study also suggest that “measles parties” – where children are brought together to intentionally spread the disease with the goal of creating immunity – accelerated spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000i3b6m9tmk5z79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants are typically most susceptible to a measles infection because they are typically not eligible to be vaccinated until age 1. At the beginning of the outbreak in September 2018, Yang’s work suggests, more than half of infants in the community were susceptible, along with about a quarter of young children between the ages of 1 and 4 who were the second most susceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000j3b6mdv6x4exw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initial vaccination campaigns lowered susceptibility rates by about 10 percentage points by the end of December, and the efforts “appeared to effectively contain the outbreak at the time,” according to Yang’s study; estimates suggest that each new case was linked to just one additional case at the end of the year, low enough to potentially avoid an epidemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000k3b6mao7c6mqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the chains of transmission grew quickly in the early months of 2019, faster than changes in susceptibility from vaccination rates could explain, suggesting that close contact rates were had increased, especially among young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000l3b6mfmlebgad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles outbreaks are “dynamic,” Yang said. “It’s not just susceptibility that is determining how many new cases you are going to get. It also has to do with how people are interacting with each other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000m3b6myf2fuzat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data shows that were surges in the numbers of vaccines administered at certain key points: around the start of the school year, for example, and when the city issued a mandate that children living in certain ZIP codes be vaccinated to attend school or day care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000n3b6mpdahpded@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This intensive work required a persistent, all-hands-on-deck approach, Barbot said. The only situation that required a comparable amount of dedicated staff and time was the Covid-19 response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000o3b6mgszu3k3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2019, about five months after the initial measles cases were reported in New York, officials in both New York City and Rockland County declared a state of emergency due to measles – a move that was also quite extraordinary before the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000p3b6m3ddvr1tz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The emergency declaration gave us the resources that we needed on an ongoing basis to make sure that lack of resources wasn’t a reason why we couldn’t bring the outbreak to an end,” Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000q3b6m82l2fn99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But official mandates and emergency declarations supported the more informal work that had already been happening on the ground, experts say. Strong relationships that were forged between public health workers and trusted community leaders helped with broader communication strategies to dispel disinformation about the vaccines, as well as misconceptions about measles being a benign disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000r3b6maz4eyx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Blima Marcus, a nurse practitioner at the Bellevue Hospital Center, used her expertise as a health care provider and a member of the Orthodox Jewish community to forge inroads with a culturally sensitive approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000s3b6meuzt8mvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that the only thing that really can help is when your own community can find the resources to mobilize and start knocking on doors, literally and figuratively, to reach people where they’re at and start slowly changing the narrative,” she said. “The notion that there’s no one to ask and there are no answers to these deep vaccine questions – that’s false, and [that notion] is part of what we were hoping to change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000t3b6mcz26rjcz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Marcus helped develop a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/a-slice-of-pie.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; with information about the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that was distributed to about 10,000 homes, a plan specifically designed to address anti-vaccination messaging that had been infiltrating the community and to reach individuals who might be less inclined to find information through digital media.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000u3b6mctobk4l1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She and other community members knew that they had to be nimble in responding to a rapidly changing situation – strategically addressing misinformation as it arose and focusing on particular parts of the community most in need – and they were often moving faster than formal government systems would allow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000v3b6mhce0rqzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you have emergency funding, it’s not as emergent as we actually need,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000w3b6m7bldj2kw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the outbreaks were declared over, Rockland County had &lt;a href="https://www.rocklandcountyny.gov/departments/health/communicable-diseases/measles#:~:text=The%20outbreak%20was%20declared%20over,2019%20and%20mid%2DMay%202019." target="_blank"&gt;312 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and New York City had 649. No deaths from measles were reported during the outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zoy86z00003b6migl92kma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreaks haven’t reached that size yet. This year, nearly 230 measles cases have been identified in outbreaks in West Texas and a nearby New Mexico county, with the first case confirmed about a month and a half ago and two deaths of people with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000x3b6mbg41xkqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Much of the current outbreak is concentrated among a tight-knit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, which faces some similar vulnerabilities as the Orthodox Jewish communities in New York did.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000y3b6mh5qsihrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I felt was very effective in making connections, in forging inroads and, ultimately, in many places, increasing immunization rates is having that culturally competent teamwork because people are averse to being told what to do by others who they feel don’t understand them or their belief systems,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

As a result, vigilance is important for canine caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;″‘If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras,’ is a saying I learned in veterinary school,” Dr. Jo Myers, a veterinarian with veterinary telehealth company Vetster, told HuffPost. “It’s a reminder that most of the time, something common is going on. This means that when your dog does something unusual, it’s unlikely to be something serious or rare. However, there are some situations that warrant more urgent attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, HuffPost asked Myers and other experts to identify the signs and changes they would never ignore in a dog. Read on for 13 things to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cough That Lasts More Than A Couple Of Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We often associate coughing with colds or the flu, but a persistent cough can signal something more serious, like heart disease,” Myers said. “While dogs can get upper respiratory infections that cause coughing, they typically go away within a couple of weeks, often without treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your dog’s cough lasts more than a couple of weeks, however, you’ll want to seek medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dogs of any age can be affected by several different kinds of heart conditions that lead to congestive heart failure, often with few noticeable early signs,” Myers noted. “In many cases, a lingering cough ― especially one that doesn’t respond to treatment for an infectious disease ― is the first sign of serious heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplained Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexplained weight loss in dogs is concerning because it’s uncommon and often linked to serious underlying conditions,” Myers said. “While weight loss due to a decreased appetite occurs frequently with many common illnesses, significant weight loss in a dog that is eating normally and not vomiting or having diarrhea is far less typical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommended checking with a veterinarian if you have concerns about your dog’s weight fluctuation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog starts losing weight unexpectedly with no clear cause, I’m concerned about a potentially serious underlying issue, such as an unusual infection, a blood disorder or cancer,” Myers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Respiratory Rate And Effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog or cat is having trouble breathing, especially if they haven’t had a period of intense exercise, this is concerning for underlying health conditions,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/KAITLYNKREBS" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Katie Krebs" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/KAITLYNKREBS" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Katie Krebs&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of clinical primary care at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “When an animal is resting, you can count their breaths and look at their respiratory effort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that your dog’s breathing rate is elevated while resting, you should consider further evaluation by a veterinarian.

This may occur when your dog is eating dinner, for example, and suddenly stiffens or begins staring at the person approaching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that this behavior is often rooted in a dog’s past negative experiences, like never having had their own blanket or needing to defend their food from other dogs in their home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The behavior may even extend to a person the dog is especially attached to and protective of,” Williams said. “While it’s only natural to be protective of things that are important to us, this behavior can become dangerous if the dog is becoming aggressive, such as lunging or biting. For example, if you or someone in your family cannot go near your dog’s food bowl for fear of your dog biting, it may be a good idea to speak with an animal behavior specialist, who can help you and your dog develop a plan to work on the resource guarding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Sore, Swollen Or Closed Eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your dog has a sore, swollen or closed eye, this must never be ignored,” said &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=67acec93e4b02322707886ff&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedhousesitters.com%2Fblog%2Fauthors%2Frebecca-macmillan%2F" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rebecca MacMillan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=67acec93e4b02322707886ff&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedhousesitters.com%2Fblog%2Fauthors%2Frebecca-macmillan%2F" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Rebecca MacMillan&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian with TrustedHousesitters. “Many different eye conditions can cause serious problems if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She listed corneal ulcers, glaucoma and foreign bodies in the eye as examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these conditions are very painful and if left untreated could cause your pet to lose their vision,” MacMillan said. “I have seen dogs lose an eye on more than one occasion because treatment was delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bad breath should never be dismissed as just ‘doggy breath,’” MacMillan said. “It is not normal and could be an indication of dental disease or other oral diseases, like a tumor or a foreign body. We can also see bad breath in kidney failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if your dog seems to be otherwise OK, it’s still worth looking into canine halitosis and having your vet check on their teeth during visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take a good sniff of your dog’s breath,” advised &lt;a href="https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/blog/get-to-know-wellness-natural-pet-food-veterinarian-dr-danielle-bernal/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Danielle Bernal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/blog/get-to-know-wellness-natural-pet-food-veterinarian-dr-danielle-bernal/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Danielle Bernal&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian with Wellness Pet Food. “While a dog’s breath is unlikely to smell minty fresh like ours, you want to check to see if it is pungent, a key sign that dental disease is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/periodontal-disease" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies suggest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/periodontal-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; at least 80% of dogs, particularly seniors and small dogs, suffer from dental disease. That’s why you want to pay attention to bad breath, as well as teeth color, gum color and gum texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never ignore the state of your pet’s teeth and gums, as they contribute mightily to their overall health,” Bernal said. “If left unchecked, poor dental hygiene can progress to periodontal disease, which can potentially impact your pet’s heart, kidneys and even liver. Dental issues can not only cause pain and infection, but also eating issues and weight loss that lead to more problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have Labrador retrievers, and if they stop eating, then I know something is wrong,” Krebs said. “In dogs that are highly food motivated, not wanting to eat or take treats is usually a sign of something systemic or that they are in pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For dogs who are a little pickier with their food, one or two skipped meals on occasion is less of a cause for concern, but you should never ignore a prolonged decrease in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor appetite or a reluctance to eat can also signal gingivitis, gum disease or periodontal disease,” Bernal noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, pay attention if your dog can’t seem to get enough water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excessive drinking or urination can be a sign of diabetes, kidney disease or hormonal disorders,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dogtordulake/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michelle Dulake" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/dogtordulake/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Michelle Dulake&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and co-founder of pet supplement company Fera Pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Edwin Tan via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Edwin Tan via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A dog that is suddenly skipping meals and/or showing signs of weakness and fatigue might be dealing with a serious underlying issue. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lethargy Or Weakness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your dog is suddenly less active, refuses to play or seems weak, it could be due to pain, infection or metabolic disorders,” Dulake said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dog who is more tired than usual might be exhibiting subtle signs of joint pain due to osteoarthritis. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-pierce-dvm-mba-a18075b8/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Courtney Pierce" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-pierce-dvm-mba-a18075b8/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Dr. Courtney Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, a canine pain medical lead with animal health company Zoetis, recommended being on the lookout for early indicators like difficulty going up or down stairs, lagging on walks, hesitation to jump up or down and limping after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, my clients will say to me, ‘He’s doing OK, he’s just slowing down a little,’” she said. “And while I certainly don’t want my older dog acting like a puppy when it comes to things like chewing up my shoes or forgetting his manners, ‘slowing down’ is not a change I welcome or ignore. Almost 40% of dogs suffer from pain associated with [osteoarthritis] but it often goes undiagnosed until the condition is very advanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although osteoarthritis is often considered a disease of old age, Pierce emphasized that this is not accurate and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10838335/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pointed to research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10838335/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;pointed to research&lt;/a&gt; finding that about 39% of dogs between 9 months and 4 years of age showed radiographic signs of the condition in at least one joint&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My own dog was diagnosed with osteoarthritis when he was just 4 years old when I noticed he didn’t want to run and play with my children like he used to,” she explained. “Thankfully, because I didn’t ignore the signs, we were able to get him started on pain relief and a weight management program right away. Now we can look forward to many more happy and active years with him!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring GI Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An occasional upset stomach in an otherwise healthy dog is usually not a cause for concern,” Myers said. “Most cases of vomiting or diarrhea from eating something unusual resolve on their own within a day or so. However, when a dog shows intermittent appetite loss, vomiting or diarrhea over time, it raises a red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if each episode seemingly resolves on its own, recurring GI issues over weeks or months can signal a bigger underlying issue, which could include pancreatitis, a food intolerance or allergy, gastrointestinal obstruction or kidney and liver disease. Bloodwork and abdominal imaging can help vets identify the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any time blood is noted, that’s not something to be ignored,” Krebs said. “If there is blood in vomit or diarrhea, the dog or cat should probably be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood could indicate an infection, poisoning or other gastrointestinal problems. Be similarly mindful of abdominal distension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially relevant for large and giant breed dogs, but abdominal distension, or an outward appearance of bloating, can be a life-threatening medical condition,” Krebs said. “When I see dogs with bloated abdomens, that’s something I would take them to the vet right away to determine if more significant interventions are required. This becomes even more significant when accompanied by vomiting and abdominal pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog is limping this means that they are in pain, even if they are still eating and not crying out,” MacMillan said. “So many owners turn a blind eye to this, especially if their dog seems well otherwise and the limp is mild or intermittent. But it is important to remember that a limp is not normal behavior and there must be something causing it which needs investigating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limping can indicate an injury or an illness like Lyme disease and certain immune-mediated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My biggest concern, however, is lameness of a single leg accompanied by an increasingly larger area of swelling near the knee, shoulder or wrist,” Myers said. “Those locations are frequently affected by the most common type of primary bone cancer in dogs: osteosarcoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection can allow for intervention before the tumor grows large enough to cause significant issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to limping, other ways dogs might indicate they are in pain include difficulty getting up, reluctance to sit or having more accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Little dogs may show signs of pain in not wanting to be picked up,” Williams added. “If you notice these signs in your dog, it’s important to call your veterinarian and determine if you should bring your dog in to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enlarged Lymph Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lymph nodes are essential to a healthy immune system, swelling as they respond to nearby infections,” Myers said. “For example, if you have a head cold, you might notice swollen glands under your jaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs similarly have lymph nodes that swell and feel like little round balls under the skin around their armpits, jaws, backs of the knees and groin areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While localized swelling often indicates infection, some conditions cause lymph nodes throughout the body to enlarge,” Myers said. “One of the most frequent cancers in dogs, lymphoma, is a common cause of generalized lymph node enlargement. Although typically seen in middle-aged and older dogs, lymphoma can develop in dogs as young as 1 year old. Other medical conditions can also cause generalized lymph node enlargement, but lymphoma is a primary concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden Behavior Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increased aggression, confusion or withdrawal may signal pain, illness or neurological disorders,” Dulake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that other behaviors like persistent scratching might indicate allergies, parasites or infections ― especially when accompanied by skin changes or hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owners should also never turn a blind eye to aggressive behavior in their dogs ― it is a clear sign that your dog is not happy about something,” MacMillan said. “Aggression can occur when a dog has underlying pain somewhere, but&lt;br&gt;anxiety, stress or boredom can also trigger this. Definitely don’t wait until&lt;br&gt;someone gets injured before seeking advice for your dog’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although dogs will be dogs, owners are responsible for teaching their canines good behaviors and social skills in order to avoid accidental injuries and foster positive interactions with people and other dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without appropriate guidance, many dogs either forget or never learn how to have basic manners, leading to problem behaviors including nuisance barking, jumping on people, no impulse control and ‘friendly’ greetings that are actually rude,” Myers said. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collapse Or Seizure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, dogs don’t collapse unless there is an underlying medical condition,” Krebs said. “There are a number of things that could cause a dog to collapse, and this becomes more of a medical emergency when the animal loses consciousness or has seizure-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

The air was so laden with pollution from coal power plants and cars at the time that it turned the rain toxic. Downpours killed fish, destroyed forests, eroded statues, and damaged buildings, sparking public outcry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Acid rain is a particularly alarming demonstration of the simple adage that what goes up must come down,” former Colorado Senator Gary Hart &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/07/archives/experts-call-acid-rain-growing-problem-in-us.html?searchResultPosition=17"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. “With acid rain,” he said, “what comes down is much worse than what went up — worse in its potential damage to trees and crops, worse in its potential damage to fresh‐water lakes and fish and tourism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A few decades later, acid rain had largely disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R22rarr6:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A statue on the side of a building that’s been weathered, in part, by acid rain, seen in Leipzig, Germany in 1990.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Richard Baker/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwxa _1j8uwx9"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A forest in Poland that’s been killed off by acid rain.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beginning around 1990, the US and Europe passed legislation that limited the amount of acid-forming pollutants — such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — that power plants could emit. Laws requiring car manufacturers to put catalytic converters into new vehicles, which reduced harmful emissions, were also taking effect. That brings us to today: While precipitation in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acid-rain-environment-earth-day/"&gt;some regions&lt;/a&gt; is still unnaturally acidic, on the whole, acid rain is largely a problem of the past and a major environmental success story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, however, there’s another problem with our rain — and it’s even more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While precipitation has become less acidic, a growing body of evidence suggests that it’s now full of many other pollutants that pose a risk to public health, including microplastics. And unlike the compounds that cause acid rain, these pollutants are almost impossible to get rid of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-new-pollutants-in-our-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new pollutants in our rain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As government regulators focused on reigning in air pollution, companies were busy generating new sources of pollution, including plastics and PFAS, the so-called &lt;a href="/2022/8/25/23318667/pfas-forever-chemicals-safety-drinking-water"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. PFAS, which stands for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of compounds used, among other things, to make fabric stain-resistant and pans nonstick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, these modern-era substances — which famously take decades to millennia to degrade — have leached into the environment, reaching every corner of the planet, no matter how tall or deep. Microplastics, PFAS, and some other compounds, such as pesticides, are now so widespread that they’ve essentially become part of our biome, not unlike bacteria or fungi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They’re so common, in fact, that they’re even found in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0335-5"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724075090"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423011664?via%3Dihub"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; microplastics in rain falling all over the world — even in remote, unpopulated regions. For one 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5819"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;researchers documented microplastics in rainwater that fell on several national parks and wilderness areas in the Western US. Most of the plastic bits were microfibers, such as those shed from polyester sweaters or carpeting on the floor of a car. The researchers estimated that more than 1,000 metric tons of plastic from the atmosphere fall on parks in the West each year, including both as rainfall and as dry dust. That’s equivalent to roughly 120 to 300 million plastic water bottles, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The largest source of those microplastics was highways, said Janice Brahney, a biogeochemist at Utah State University who led the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;study. Roads are often littered with plastic waste that gets broken down by cars and kicked up into the air. Those particles are typically lighter than soil, so once they become airborne, they can easily move around in the atmosphere and get grabbed by rain as it falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A gull carrying a piece of trash along the San Gabriel River in Southern California.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another important source of plastic rain is the ocean, Brahney said. Several million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, much of which breaks down into microplastics. When waves crash on the beach or bubbles burst on the sea surface, it sends microscopic plastic particles into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plastic rain is an environmental threat that’s harder to fix than the last one. “It’s much worse than the acid rain problem,” Brahney said. “With acid rain, we could stop emitting acid precursors and then acid rain would stop falling. But we can’t stop the microplastic cycle anymore. It’s there and it’s not going away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The story of PFAS is similarly bleak: Researchers have detected these chemicals in rain across the planet from the US and Sweden to China and even Antarctica, often at levels above drinking water guidelines. For a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104224002678"&gt;study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; — titled “It’s raining PFAS in South Florida” — researchers analyzed rainwater that fell around Miami and found more than 20 PFAS compounds, including PFOS and PFOA. Although these two PFAS were phased out in the US years ago due to public health concerns, the researchers still found them at concentrations beyond government health advisory levels for drinking water, underscoring the remarkable persistence of forever chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For another &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02765?ref=PDF"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, scientists reviewed studies of PFAS in rainwater and similarly found concentrations of these chemicals at levels above what US and Danish regulators say is safe for drinking water. The authors concluded that, based on health advisories, no untreated rainwater would be considered safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“For us to get rid of PFAS, we probably have to go back in time,” said Natalia Soares Quinete, a chemist at Florida International University who was involved in the 2024 study. Even though the government is increasingly regulating PFAS, she said, “I don’t see us completely getting rid of those chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that most people — especially in wealthy countries like the US — don’t rely on untreated rainwater. What is concerning is that rain ends up in groundwater, rivers, and reservoirs that feed into municipal water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment plants help a lot, typically &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667010021002432"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; upwards of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of microplastics in water, but some still pass through. A study &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000250"&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found a small amount of microplastics in bottled water and tap water in France. Similarly, typical filtration plants for municipal water remove some but not all PFAS. Authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, a federal agency, estimate that at least 45 percent of the country’s tap water has at least one type of PFAS present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment facilities don’t have the technology to treat all of the microplastic compounds, let alone the technology to measure them, Brahney said. “There are tens of thousands of chemicals involved, and we only understand a fraction of them,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Whether or not you’re at risk from microplastics, PFAS, and other chemicals is all about exposure — how much of those substances you’re breathing in or consuming. There’s not much of them in a single glass of tap or a bottle of water. The problem is that there are many other pathways that these pollutants can take to enter your body, such as through food. And over time they add up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-polluted-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to protect yourself from polluted rain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Avoid drinking untreated rainwater and eating snow, no matter how pristine it looks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you can afford to filter your water, you should. Standard filters like reverse osmosis — which runs water through a semi-permeable membrane — typically remove a large portion of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-023-00286-2"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Opt for tap over bottled water to avoid ingesting microplastics. Tap water is also way &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b00750"&gt;better for the planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that the human brains contain as much as a typical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html"&gt;plastic spoon’s worth of microplastic&lt;/a&gt;, by weight. Scientists still don’t understand what impact that might have on human health, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00405-8"&gt;they suspect&lt;/a&gt; that microplastics could be linked to cancer, heart and kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly all Americans have a measurable amount of PFAS in their blood, &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/human-exposure.html"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; US health officials, though concentrations of some of them — including PFOA and PFOS — are declining. On the whole, forever chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/health-effects.html"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; a range of ailments including increased cholesterol, decreases in birth weight, and kidney cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these contaminants can also be &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/11/microplastics-are-sickening-and-killing-wildlife-disrupting-earth-systems/"&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723045643?via%3Dihub"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, which unlike most of us, do rely on untreated water. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/toxicology/articles/10.3389/ftox.2022.1010185/full"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, linked exposure to PFAS to impaired immune systems in alligators. “If we have these contaminants in our rainwater they’re getting into our groundwater,” Brahney said. “They’re infiltrating our soils. Every organism is interacting with rainwater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ultimately, what all of this research reveals is that the planet is dirty, even if the filth can be hard to see. These chemicals are in the rain because they’re abundant in the environment — and they’re in the environment because they’re in the rain.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Five years ago, Melanie Richburg used a roll of duct tape, a HEPA filter and a portable fan to draw contaminated air out of a hospital room where patients were tested for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Now, as the state’s largest measles outbreak in three decades &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/18/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs/"&gt;sickens an increasing number&lt;/a&gt; of Texans in the South Plains region, the Lynn County Hospital District, where Richburg serves as the chief executive officer, is still without specialized isolation rooms to treat patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So, she’s prepared to bring out the duct tape again.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If we see the volume of patients exceeds the number of beds available at children's hospitals, we’re going to need a contingency plan,” said Richburg, whose county is 30 miles south of Lubbock and has had two measles cases. “The biggest struggle we have is the same struggle we had during COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The coronavirus pandemic underscored the need for robust public health infrastructure. And it brought to light a remarkable urban-rural divide in access to basic health services. In the months after the virus ravaged the country, federal dollars flowed to local public health districts, and policies targeting health care deserts saw a renewed push.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Yet as a disease that had been declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 makes a resurgence, rural West Texas communities and state officials are scrambling to respond. Aging infrastructure, a dearth of primary care providers and long distances between testing sites and laboratories plague much of rural Texas, where the measles outbreak has concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;At least 198&lt;/a&gt; people in Texas have been infected with measles since late January, and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/26/texas-measles-death/"&gt;one child has died&lt;/a&gt; from measles, the first such death in the country in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;More measles cases are expected, and the outbreak could last for months, state health services commissioner Jennifer Shuford told lawmakers last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Though different from COVID in many ways, measles is similarly revealing how a lack of public health resources leaves rural communities vulnerable. What’s left are local leaders forced to scrape together the few tools they have to respond to an emergency, contending with years of lackluster investment from the state and federal level to proactively prevent emerging public health threats.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re in a public health shortage area,” said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the Andrews County Health Department.“ You have to think outside the box.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="c62d8813-07d8-4e87-9cf4-3c68969cbbaa" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Lack of infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some 64 Texas counties don’t have a hospital, and 25 lack primary care physicians, according to the &lt;a href="https://texasagriculture.gov/Portals/0/forms/ER/RuralHealth/SORH%20Infographic.pdf"&gt;Texas Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-six rural Texas hospitals closed between 2010 and 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://www.torchnet.org/advocacy--rural-hospital-closure.html"&gt;a rural hospital trade organization&lt;/a&gt;, and although closures slowed in the years since, those still standing are often in crumbling buildings with few medical providers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Swaths of Texas have scant resources for public awareness campaigns. And they lack sufficient medical staff with expertise to provide the one-on-one education needed to encourage vaccination and regular visits to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have a difficult time in our area finding pediatricians for our newborns,” said Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center. “That’s a problem. If you can’t find a pediatrician, then when a serious question comes up, who do you ask?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most of Texas’ measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County. Cases have also been confirmed in eight other counties spanning Dallam near the Oklahoma border down to Ector, south of Gaines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;To contain the illness, rural health care teams have cordoned off spaces to conduct measles testing, used social media to blast residents with information about vaccination efficacy and schlepped throat swabs across counties to ship them to a state lab in Austin — the only public state facility that was conducting measles testing until the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory, part of a national network of CDC-funded labs, began measles testing last Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Testing is critical for measles, experts say, because infected individuals can be contagious for several days and must isolate themselves to avoid spreading it further.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Gaines County, runners have had to drive specimens up to 70 miles to get to a FedEx office where they could ship the specimen to the state laboratory. It could then take another 48 hours to get test results. During that time, public health officials would ask patients suspected of measles to quarantine — but they don’t know if they followed through.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Some people need the test to say ‘I’m positive’ before they actually do something or follow the directions given,” Amiri said. “Having that testing available is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, just south of Gaines, Mattimoe is using the old City Hall building as a testing site because he doesn’t have a reverse pressure room.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Those rooms prevent contagious diseases from spreading to other people, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html#:~:text=of%20serious%20complications.-,What%20to%20do%20if%20you%20have%20a%20suspected%20case,must%20use%20N%2D95%20masks."&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; suspected measles patients are treated there when possible. In the absence of such spaces, rural counties including Lynn and Yoakum have improvised a room for measles testing, hoping they don’t get overrun with more patients they can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Mattimoe, who said he is anticipating more cases, opted to open up City Hall for testing since that building happens to be vacant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;WIthout it, Mattimoe said, he’d have to “shut down the entire department for two hours between suspected cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

 Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune
        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;h3 id="2b3fad39-09a3-4ce3-bea2-9ca3a70f5f7e" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Reactive instead of proactive responses&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health is based upon prevention, yet it’s emergencies that spur the most action, particularly in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It was only after a school-aged child died from measles that state and federal support intensified. Twenty seven contractors were brought into the outbreak area last week to assist local health departments, Shuford, the state health services commissioner, said during a legislative hearing. A public awareness campaign with billboards and social media messaging was also launched. And, upon a request from the state, the federal CDC sent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/cdc-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;“disease detectives”&lt;/a&gt; to West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;County officials also doubled down their efforts. In Ector County, County Judge Dustin Fawcett made media appearances to discuss the efficacy of the MMRV vaccine whose two doses provide 97% protection against measles. And the commissioners court approved the purchase of a $7,695 freezer to store measles test specimens — samples shipped after the date of collection must be kept at -70 degrees celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      

  &lt;div class="c-plugin c-plugin--giant c-plugin--default c-plugin--flush c-plugin--o-landscape"&gt;

 Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune
        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, residents stepped up their communal responsibilities. Mattimoe saw a surge of people coming into the clinic to get vaccinated. “Unfortunately, the death of a child was one of the things that spurred many people to come in,” Mattimoe said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even as state and federal officials are sharing more information on vaccines, experts say those campaigns needed to come sooner. They have known for years that vaccination rates have been declining.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We shouldn't be doing it during an outbreak,” Amiri said. “We should be doing it beforehand to prevent the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Getting vaccines in residents is further complicated by the fact that Texas has a mostly decentralized system of public health. Cities and counties can stand up their own public health departments or districts, but the majority of rural counties can’t afford to have their own. Instead, they rely on &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/regional-local-health-operations/public-health-regions"&gt;one of 11 public health regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Those regions cover vast territories with limited dollars and don’t always know the ins and outs of local communities, especially on how to motivate residents to get vaccinated. The logistical challenges of traveling across counties adds another layer of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You have to call these tiny towns and figure out who can give you space for free to set up a testing clinic,” Wells said. “Then you’re driving from Lubbock to rural areas and that cuts how long you can keep the clinics open.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;And then, rural public health departments are having to contend with mixed messaging from the federal level as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health and human services secretary, has cast vaccination as a personal choice while downplaying the news of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I think with the changes that are occurring at the federal level, we need to realize that we do need to strengthen our local public health,” Amiri said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="612f07ed-739f-478e-9428-a683950187c7" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The power of funding&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Years of underinvestment in public health left Texas &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/17/texas-coronavirus-health-funding/"&gt;ill prepared for the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Hospital equipment was scarce, and state and local health departments had outdated technology that limited access to crucial data.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic also exposed the rural-urban inequities in health care access. Residents of Texas counties without hospitals died from COVID-19 at 20% higher rates than residents of counties with hospitals, according to &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2020/12/31/covid-19-death-rates-higher-texas-counties-without-hospitals/4001910001/"&gt;an analysis by the Austin American Statesman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;An influx in federal funding helped shore up local public health departments and stave off more rural hospital closures. Texas received &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/-/media/files/pdf/advocacy/speak/sfh_texas.pdf"&gt;$35.5 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; for improvements in public health infrastructure in fiscal year 2020. An additional $221 million — the most of any state — is flowing to Texas through the CDC’s five-year Public Health Infrastructure Grant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That funding has helped some local health departments address the measles outbreak, public health officials said. The Lubbock public health department has nearly doubled in size thanks to a $2 million grant. Those extra workers have been on the front lines of testing for measles and vaccinating children.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It moved us from undersized to right sized,” said Katherine Wells, director of the city’s public health department. “It got us to the…health department we need for Lubbock.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, Mattimoe has also used grant dollars to grow his health department. Four new employees, including an epidemiologist and a social worker, have helped the county complete a population health assessment that offers a snapshot of residents’ needs. And its year-round vaccine clinics have helped stave off the worst of the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Community immunity has really saved us,” Mattimoe said. “There will be a case eventually, but there’s something to be said about herd immunity.” Andrews County does not have any confirmed measles cases as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The influx of dollars that rural communities received during the height of the pandemic showed the meaningful changes that officials could do with more support, but it still hasn’t been enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas spends less on public health per person than the vast majority of other states, according to the &lt;a href="https://statehealthcompare.shadac.org/rank/117/per-person-state-public-health-funding#2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52/a/76/154/false/location"&gt;State Health Access Data Assistance Center&lt;/a&gt;, whose analysis shows Texas spent $17 per person on public health in 2023. A decade earlier, the spend was $19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The low levels of state funding particularly hurt rural communities that have higher rates of uninsured Texans and more senior citizens with greater health needs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.torchnet.org/uploads/1/1/9/5/119501126/ten_things_hospitals-map_w-photos_final.pdf"&gt;Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. &lt;/a&gt;Deteriorating buildings and the shortage of medical professionals still persist in rural areas, while lower volumes of patients means higher health care operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Lynn County, Richburg, the CEO of the health district, had hoped the makeshift contraption she made during COVID for a reverse pressure room wouldn’t be needed again in her rural community of 5,500 people. She attempted to pass a bond last year to pay for infrastructure upgrades, including a mini intensive care unit with four negative pressure rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Voters &lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2024/05/05/voters-reject-lynn-county-hospital-bond/"&gt;rejected the proposed tax increase&lt;/a&gt;, though, a gut punch to Richburg.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We wanted those four specific beds so that when we had situations where we needed to isolate patients, they’d be adequately cared for and not in a room with a broken window with a fan duct taped in it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In addition to isolation rooms, Lynn County’s health care system is due for a major electrical upgrade, Richburg said. The facility’s backup power generator doesn’t cover the MRI machine or the CAT scan. In the meantime, Richburg and her staff plan to do their best with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re still here, the lights still come on every morning, and patients still come in for services,” Richburg said. “We’re not going away.”&lt;/p&gt;

Proponents claim probiotics can boost your microbiome — the organisms that live inside your gut — and help with digestive issues, immune function and even mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UELL6DJ6OZBKTOBGXLTW6VOCBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the marketing claims about over-the-counter probiotics largely do not match the evidence.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a gastroenterologist, I rarely advise my patients to start a probiotic — much to their surprise. They’re even more surprised when I tell them that’s part of the evidence-based guidelines: The American Gastroenterological Association &lt;a href="https://gastro.org/news/aga-does-not-recommend-the-use-of-probiotics-for-most-digestive-conditions-2/" target="_blank"&gt;does not recommend&lt;/a&gt; probiotics for most digestive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CXU2LDK6GRADVGCCGB3W3GOR44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, here’s what I do recommend: Eat a fiber-rich diet. This time-tested recommendation remains one of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;strongest-studied ways&lt;/a&gt; to promote and preserve a healthy microbiome and improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5Z24S2BKJBC6PIVTU3MSLEB3WE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eating a low-fiber diet &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;leads to the loss&lt;/a&gt; of major categories of bacteria — and once certain groups are lost, they&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt; can be lost for good&lt;/a&gt;, even if you try later to ramp up fiber intake later. So the time to act is now. The more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4837298/" target="_blank"&gt;diverse your diet&lt;/a&gt;, the more diverse your microbiome, and the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23985870/" target="_blank"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; you are. So choose a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; of high-fiber plants, nuts and fermented foods to feed your microbiome the nutrient buffet it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE"&gt;Research on probiotics is all over the map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2LQPBGSDABDZLB5XH5S3WBMA6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officially, the term “probiotic” is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.66.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as live microorganisms known to confer a health benefit. But of the more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715136/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of probiotics, there is vast heterogeneity across experiments — different bacterial strains, different doses and different outcomes being measured. Some take characteristics of the host microbiome into account; others don’t, focusing more on symptoms or other health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A375ZN2QXVAADPC7XAT5JWLSLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This creates a confusing research landscape peppered with both positive and negative results. Even when &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46872" target="_blank"&gt;aggregated into meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt;, the results are all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGGRBSRCHBDXVOT4VIKIGA26QY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t consider over-the-counter probiotics to be drugs, so unlike medications,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;they don’t have to go through the process of rigorous testing and clinical trials. This issue also comes up when scientists seek to draw conclusions about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/09/antiaging-skincare-routine-retinol/" target="_blank"&gt;skin care products&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/01/vitamins-supplements-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which also aren’t regulated as drugs by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="M6LHNZMAVNDF5OER7JM7K4KHBE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="M6LHNZMAVNDF5OER7JM7K4KHBE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The promise of the microbiome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ATPJE5Y2QFEYRB2VY7V7ZTBQXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Microbiome science as we know it took off in the early 2000s when researchers recognized how many healthy bacteria — not the kinds that cause a sudden major infection — reside inside our guts. Shortly afterward, the National Institutes of Health laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2792171/" target="_blank"&gt;Human Microbiome Project&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06244" target="_blank"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to sequence and improve our understanding of the microbiome, from which many discoveries were made about diseases &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/28/parkinsons-disease-gut-brain-connection/" target="_blank"&gt;influenced by our gut bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWDCQLW6S5HZTG6RBY35OPQO2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In theory, it would logically follow, altering the bacterial composition of the microbiome, possibly through the introduction of live microorganisms, could benefit our health. But achieving that has been easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QK7GBMMUSBFONN3AOCY64HNJ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Probiotics — or other ways to modulate the microbiome, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/03/what-is-a-fecal-transplant/" target="_blank"&gt;fecal transplant&lt;/a&gt; — have incredible potential, but realizing that potential is still a nascent scientific field in many ways. Each of our microbiomes, medical history and diets is unique. We still need rigorous studies that would allow us to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30193112/" target="_blank"&gt;personalize such treatments&lt;/a&gt; for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PLQVWDRXAJCFPHJ7QYPHDRUNPQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PLQVWDRXAJCFPHJ7QYPHDRUNPQ"&gt;Why misinformation is rampant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PKSE2KILBBGWDESCJDU7ABENO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to probiotics, commercial interests have outpaced the science. This &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30415-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;uncomfortable disconnect&lt;/a&gt; has been known to gastroenterologists and microbiome scientists for many years. One common tactic by marketers is to blur data from one probiotic into the purported benefits of the one being sold — as if all probiotic types fall neatly under one big umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUT2AJZYLVCHBCZMXENT3IDMVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Misinformation about probiotics is common on social media. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-15456-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 100 YouTube videos about probiotics found that 95 percent of the videos endorsed a positive attitude toward their consumption — with far more content produced by amateurs than by experts. And a 2021 study found that &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258098" target="_blank"&gt;discussions of probiotics on X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/a&gt; were dominated by advertisements and promotions rather than by scientists or policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA"&gt;Who should take probiotics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7TI2HKPNVZEQXI3GUNZ4G3RB2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are a few very specific scenarios where &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)34729-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; support the use of probiotics in adults.

Your own experience is valid — a fraction of people do experience a benefit. In these cases, I tell my patients I’m glad they’ve found something that has helped them and feel reassured if they’ve bought a probiotic from a company vetted by a third-party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HESIQWVE6RFIVN6YSOUD2JCUAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But more often, I see patients experiencing some symptom — perhaps bloating or belly pain — and they started taking a probiotic to see if it would help. Several hundreds of dollars later, the symptoms persist.

We quickly understood how deadly an infection could be, especially for those with underlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it has taken years of research to start making sense of how a bout of Covid can lead to lasting, sometimes invisible changes in different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of these effects, such as chronic fatigue and brain fog, are considered long Covid, defined as symptoms from an infection that persist for at least three months. By some estimates, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html" title=""&gt;400 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have been diagnosed with some form of long Covid. But an infection can also lead to other issues, including lung and heart damage and microbiome changes in the gut, that may not always be recognized as long Covid but can still have a lasting effect on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;We now have a better sense of what might be behind those changes, including the role of the widespread inflammation that Covid can cause. For most people, inflammation will subside once the virus clears. But for some, if it “rages” too intensely or persists as a “slow burn” for too long, it can wreak havoc around the body, said Dr. Braden Kuo, a neurogastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what scientists have learned so far about inflammation and the other factors driving these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-tosae5 eoo0vm40" id="link-300a4cd4"&gt;The Lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9mV0VVUkE1dHI1UEQtRC1EMHBPUXFLb2FRc0F5Q0lMYjVnRGkxNGRSR2ZTS2xYYWRBZ1dTZXNpU0NBTEhNdE5JOTBRcVpuZ1VtOHhnTU9rZjZLZjl1V2I0bUZkaHFuVkM1bkJFc084RUx4ZEw3TVVmOHAyVGJ4eDg</guid></item><item><title>For Patients Needing Transplants, Hope Arrives on Tiny Hooves - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNME0xMTM0TVViU3JnNmdhTnZDamhuOHpEeENabnFxUTAzM0NEQ2RJc1RVam9aVTlCeURmaU9ncmpMUnMxdkVNNmdtYk5zanY1aDNpRUc0TGFCQlNTQkRWYTFiUksxQmFjZkY2ZlRVdlFSVk43S3dBb2pGdnpLaVBpZVFDUkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a 300-acre farm in an undisclosed location in rural Wisconsin, surrounded by fields dotted with big red barns and bordered by wild blue chicory and goldenrod, live some of the most pampered pigs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;They are delivered by C-section to protect them from viruses that sows can carry, and bottle-fed instead of nursed for the same reason.

But the initial rumblings in late 2019 about a mysterious respiratory illness circulating in China didn’t worry Osterholm too much at first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is likely to be a coronavirus, not an influenza virus,” he thought. “And if that’s the case, we already had experienced &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;MERS&lt;/a&gt;. They were not infectious enough that we couldn’t shut them down using our traditional public health approach,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding.

Tim Walz on April 22, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="figure_credit"&gt;Glen Stubbe | AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a few weeks into 2020, Osterholm’s first blush take on the COVID-19 virus changed. It was clear that this new virus was easily transmissible. His infectious disease research center put out a statement in late January 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was on its way. Get ready for it. Move. And I can remember … thinking, ‘My God, what’s coming down the pike,’” Osterholm recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_lingering_illness"&gt;Lingering illness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was coming down the pike were more than 7 million COVID related deaths worldwide. More than 16,000 were in Minnesota, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/stats/death.html" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;Minnesota Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there was a growing number of people who endured fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and other neurological symptoms long after their initial COVID infection was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually that group of people included Osterholm himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen months after the pandemic, Osterholm was fully vaccinated and he regularly wore a mask — except for a brief period with his friends on his birthday in 2021. Two days later he, a friend and his partner came down with COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/1f355f-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b921b0-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/7fcf34-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b7c027-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/d1b2c8-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b921b0-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg" alt="Movable partitions divide tables in a restaurant.

Nguyen | MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said he wasn’t severely ill but the effects lingered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t remember the names of things. We were here at home and I was asked a question about what I might like to drink,” he said. “I couldn’t remember the name of it, and I thought, ‘Oh, my God, I’m getting Alzheimer’s.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What lay ahead for Osterholm were months of extreme fatigue and brain fog. He says the mental anguish that came with those symptoms was the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a job to do. We were in the middle of a pandemic. You don’t, as a fire chief, decide to quit putting out the fire because you might be tired that day,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Osterholm said his experience with COVID helped him better understand so many of the diseases he’s studied in his career that trigger an excessive immune system response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/10a225-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/1a1618-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/78f44c-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/4c2dd4-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/50b713-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/1a1618-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-600.jpg" alt="Kids wearing face masks sit at tables in a classroom.

Nguyen | MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with so many people simultaneously experiencing long COVID, Osterholm said it’s pushed the medical field to better understand what can sometimes be written off as patients' imagined or ill-defined conditions.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, this offers hope to [people with chronic immune diseases] too, that now there is a new effort being made to understand these immune system responses that are just out of whack,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_osterholm%E2%80%99s_new_concerns"&gt;Osterholm’s new concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic may be in the rearview mirror, but Osterholm said watching public health programs be dismantled under the Trump administration is even more emotionally challenging than navigating long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points to President Donald Trump’s attempts to eliminate USAID, which administers a global HIV program Osterholm helped create in the 2000s. &lt;a class="apm-link null" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/02/28/rfk-jr-cancelled-flu-vaccine-meetings-what-does-that-mean-for-fall-shots"&gt;He’s also worried&lt;/a&gt; that a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meeting about the next flu vaccine was cancelled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;measles is spreading in nine Texas counties&lt;/a&gt; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who is Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, has expressed skepticism about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm worries about how quickly the number of cases is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a harbinger of things to come,” he said. “We have created an environment where routine immunization of children is no longer something that we can count on happening. This is not a prediction to scare people. It’s a prediction to say, ‘Look, it this is going to happen if we don’t do something different to better understand the importance of these vaccines.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_covid_missteps"&gt;COVID missteps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm acknowledged that public health officials’ missteps during the COVID-19 pandemic eroded public trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the first COVID vaccines were highly effective. But Osterholm worried they would only offer short-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/fdcb72-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/8bc50a-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/a1564c-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/10a2cf-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/3239c9-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/8bc50a-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg" alt="A woman wearing a face mask receives a vaccine."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;Cmdr.

A booster is really important right now,’ think how different people would have perceived these vaccines,” he said. “Instead, they were made to get vaccines, they were told to get vaccines, that they would protect them and then they didn’t after months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Osterholm said a more targeted approach to lockdowns might have been better received by the public. Instead of lengthy lockdowns geared at reining in highly contagious diseases, Osterholm advocates for short periods of isolation correlated to hospital capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/99b4c6-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/86b6d9-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/0524cb-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/7ff87d-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/ef8efe-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/86b6d9-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg" alt="A movie marquee reads &amp;quot;I assure you we're not open.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;A pedestrian walks past a closed Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis on March 28, 2020.

&lt;p&gt;NCDC Director-General, Dr. Jide Idris, disclosed this in Abuja on Sunday, revealing that the patient was diagnosed in Ondo State but succumbed to the disease before test results confirmed the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idris raised an alert on the situation, emphasising the need for heightened surveillance and precautionary measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that the case underscores the persistent threat of Lassa fever in Nigeria and its potential for international transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the NCDC’s latest epidemiological report, Nigeria has recorded 2,728 suspected cases and 535 confirmed cases of Lassa fever in 2025, with 98 deaths reported across 14 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The current case fatality rate stands at 18.3 per cent, indicating the severity of the disease,” Idris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondo, Bauchi, Edo, Taraba, and Ebonyi states account for 91 per cent of all confirmed cases, with the most affected local government areas including Owo, Akure South, Etsako West, Kirfi, Akoko South-West, Bali, Esan North-East, Bauchi, Toro, and Jalingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the confirmed case involved a Nigerian physician who travelled to the UK on February 19, 2025, and returned on February 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was admitted to a private health facility in Ondo State with symptoms consistent with Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Samples were collected on February 28, 2025, but the patient passed away on March 1, 2025, before test results were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCDC later confirmed the diagnosis of Lassa fever on March 4, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investigations revealed that before his trip to the UK, the deceased had visited his fiancée in Edo State and interacted with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a precautionary measure, contact tracing efforts have been launched in both Nigeria and the UK to prevent further spread of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the NCDC, in collaboration with the Ondo State Ministry of Health, has intensified contact tracing, surveillance, and infection control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agency is identifying and monitoring all potential contacts, including family members, healthcare workers, and fellow passengers on his flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Port Health Services are also enhancing surveillance at entry points, particularly airports, while collaboration with UK health authorities ensures cross-border tracking of potential exposures,” Idris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idris reiterated public health guidelines to prevent further outbreaks, urging Nigerians to maintain proper hygiene, control rodent populations, and seek early medical attention for suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasised that Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease primarily transmitted through contact with food or household items contaminated by the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Human-to-human transmission can also occur, particularly in healthcare settings with inadequate infection prevention and control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCDC continues to monitor disease patterns, deploy rapid response teams to affected areas, and support specialized treatment centers caring for severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public awareness campaigns are ongoing, educating communities on rodent control, food safety, and the importance of early symptom reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite these efforts, Lassa fever remains a serious public health concern, with high mortality rates and the risk of international spread, as demonstrated by this recent case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="bg-light mb-4 p-2 top-article boda-bottom pb-2 caption-style"&gt;&lt;i class="fa  text-green ml-2"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Prolonged sexual abstinence can impact emotional well-being and intimacy in a relationship. [Courtesy]&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;It is healthy to have regular, quality sex as a lack of it can be harmful to one’s health and may contribute to serious medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Jane Wairimu (not her real name), a woman in her mid 30s developed high blood pressure and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616524592174-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;When she sought treatment, her doctor told her one of the reasons for these conditions at that age was a lack of regular and quality sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, a lack of regular sex has also been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Wairimu abstained from sexual activity for nearly eight years. She says her husband became impotent following the birth of their third child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“People experience periods of sexual inactivity or dry spells for various reasons, including busy schedules, being single or choosing to take a break, or adhering to religious teachings that  discourage pre-marital or &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/between-the-sheets/article/2001237038/21-reasons-why-you-should-have-sex-and-the-advantages-to-our-health"&gt;extra marital affairs&lt;/a&gt;,” explains a gynaecologist and medical consultant based at Karen Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616513706683-4" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While prolonged sexual abstinence is generally not associated with significant negative physical health effects, it can impact on emotional well being and intimacy within a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;”Anxiety, depression, and stress can arise from a lack of regular sex,”** says Dr. Joseph Odhiambo. Couples who do not engage in regular sex often feel less connected. Sex triggers the release of hormones like oxytocin and endorphins, which help manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Improved memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Oxytocin also promotes better sleep. Research suggests that frequent sexual activity is linked to improved memory, and some studies indicate that sex may help the brain grow neurons and function more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Regular sex fosters emotional closeness between partners, improving communication. Studies show that couples who have sex more frequently tend to be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;However, experts emphasize that daily intercourse is not necessary—once a week is often sufficient, as recommended by medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;After the age of 20, individuals should have sex at least twice a month to avoid complications associated with a lack of regular intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to Dr Odhiambo, a medic at Kenyatta University Teaching, Research, and Referral Hospital, sex can also boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;One study among college students found that those who had sex one to &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/features/article/2001504841/gen-z-boldly-redefine-casual-sex-and-safe-contraception-amidst-the-condom-dilemma"&gt;two times per week&lt;/a&gt; had higher levels of immunoglobulin, an antibody crucial for immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“If you are a woman experiencing menopause, regular intercourse is even more important,” explains Dr Odhiambo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Without it, the vaginal tissues can become thinner, more fragile, and prone to tearing or bleeding during sex, which may lead to discomfort and avoidance—worsening the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Menopausal changes, including vaginal dryness and irritation, can be treated with lubricants, moisturizers, or low-dose estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;It is widely believed that a lack of regular sex may contribute to prostate cancer. However, research on the topic is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While some experts suggest that frequent ejaculation might help reduce the risk, others argue that sexual activity could expose men to sexually transmitted infections that contribute to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Pharmacist and molecular biologist Dr Steve Waluande states that men should ejaculate at least 21 times per month to reduce their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Many prostate cancer patients I encounter admit to long periods without ejaculation, sometimes lasting months or even years,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is any issue that prevents an individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction during sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Studies suggest that 45 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men experience some form of sexual dysfunction, which can occur at any stage of the sexual response cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is generally classified into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Desire disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Lack of interest or reduced sexual desire. Arousal disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Difficulty becoming physically aroused. Orgasm disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delay or inability to reach orgasm. Pain disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Discomfort or pain during intercourse. While sexual dysfunction can affect individuals of all ages, it is more prevalent in those over 40 due to age-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Common sexual health concerns for men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Erectile dysfunction (inability to maintain an erection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delayed or absent ejaculation despite sufficient stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Premature ejaculation (inability to control the timing of ejaculation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For women: Difficulty achieving orgasm. Insufficient vaginal lubrication. Vaginismus (involuntary tightening of vaginal muscles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For both men and women: Low libido or lack of interest in sex. Difficulty with arousal. Pain during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Dr Odhiambo explains that medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic illnesses (e.g., kidney or liver disease), alcoholism, and substance abuse can all impact sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, certain medications, including some antidepressants, may contribute to sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Social psychologist Tamara Ochieng’, formerly of Maseno University, highlights that psychological factors—such as stress, anxiety, body image concerns, past trauma, and relationship conflicts—can also play a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Furthermore, some prescription and over-the-counter medications may reduce libido or interfere with sexual performance. The risk of sexual side effects is increased when an individual is taking several medications. Some over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants can cause erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation, explains Dr Waluande. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Late last month an unvaccinated child died in Texas in a separate measles outbreak. The deaths come as the U.S. public health programs and agencies are rocked by the appointment of &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/rfk-jr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert F. Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known vaccine skeptic, as the new secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It also comes at the five-year anniversary of the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Dr. Mike Osterholm, one of the country’s top health experts, spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Advocate &lt;/em&gt;recently about the anniversary and his concerns about U.S. public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the height of the pandemic, then-&lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/joe-biden" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:President Joe Biden;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appointed Osterholm to his &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/health/2020/7/03/how-80s-era-hiv-contact-tracing-can-help-kill-covid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID advisory committee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;COVID advisory committee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because of his expertise in pandemic preparedness, disease outbreak investigations, and public health practice. Osterholm is Regents Professor, McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, where he's taught for almost 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Osterholm has been vocal about the potential negative impacts of Kennedy’s appointment on both national and global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the immediate actions taken under Secretary Kennedy's leadership was the suspension of critical vaccine advisory meetings,” Osterholm said. “The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is responsible for recommending vaccine protocols, and a similar committee advising the Food and Drug Administration on flu vaccines, have both had their sessions canceled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Osterholm expressed deep concern over these cancellations. "I don't see any reason why we would need to have a total pause in the sharing of information," he pointed out. “Such disruptions could jeopardize the ability of agencies like the CDC and FDA to respond to emerging public health crises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He also pointed to the &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/cdc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; delayed response to the measles outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/texas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attributing it to the necessity of clearing communications through the &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/department-of-health-and-human-services" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Department of Health and Human Services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Effective public health relies heavily on good communication; without it, challenges become more pronounced, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he explained. “Effective communication enhances the likelihood of successfully addressing public health emergencies and bringing them to a resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The importance of maintaining robust communication as well as vaccination programs is being underscored by the measles outbreaks. In Texas, that outbreak has resulted in over 130 cases. The death in the state is the first U.S. measles fatality in about a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During a recent Cabinet meeting, Kennedy downplayed the severity of the outbreak, suggesting that measles occurrences are routine and misstating hospitalization protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What he said was not true,” Osterholm said. “He had a number of misstatements...He also said that the children that were hospitalized were being quarantined. Quarantine is something we use to basically take people who might be infectious and capable of transmitting and in a sense isolating them from doing that. That is not true. These children are all hospitalized because they're severely ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the last week, Kennedy, who first seemed to tout fish oil instead of vaccines, has taken to Fox News to recommend the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On top of all this, Osterholm characterized the administration's approach to governing as being led by a "wildly swinging machete" rather than a "finely precisioned surgical tool," suggesting that necessary changes should be implemented thoughtfully and strategically. “While it's essential to assess workforce productivity and make necessary adjustments, such actions should be executed with precision, akin to using a surgical instrument, rather than through broad and hasty measures, because some of our finest doctors and researchers as well as grants might be part of that machete cut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He further criticized the abrupt withdrawal of support for numerous global health programs aimed at combating diseases and promoting healthy lives for children. “I compare it to suddenly denying a patient a lifesaving drug without warning because these moves by the administration will have immediate and severe consequences,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He predicted that these decisions could lead to a crisis, especially with anticipated major cuts to federal health agencies like the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration-fda" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/nih" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Addressing the potential cuts in funding for programs targeting diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/hiv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AIDS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIDS &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and malaria, Osterholm asserted that these diseases "don't know borders, but they love chaos." He explained that reduced attention and resources can enhance the transmission of these diseases, leading to a "double whammy" where the elimination of international borders for transmission is compounded by increased spread due to diverted focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The damage inflicted by such neglect may be immediate but will have long-term implications, making recovery challenging,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regarding the bird flu problem, Osterholm emphasized that it requires a long-term solution, particularly the development of reliable, durable, and safe vaccines. He criticized the current minimal investment in vaccine research and development for both flu and coronaviruses. “It’s a major mistake that will incur a significant price in the future,” he said. “Having more effective vaccines readily available and ensuring public willingness to receive them are crucial steps in mitigating the impact of future pandemics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The convergence of leadership that undermines vaccine efficacy, coupled with policies that disrupt both domestic and global health initiatives, presents a precarious future for public health, setting up a perfect storm, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Everything that I could define as a disrupter is what's happening in terms of public health in this country,” he cautioned. “The proof is in the pudding of what's happening right now. When people used to ask me how concerned I was about public health, I always said I sleep with one eye open, and lately I feel like I've been sleeping with three eyes open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5QWmxoTExXbG1qM2s1ekk0T1B0dTA4MG9xR2ZBcUMxRXp4STBlYkNkTFM4eHBISGx0U0tadzBoOXZRSGZBb3dlb1NsWEkyWTd2bVBrVlZNbmkxYS1XNTNNeExqYm5iOVhaN0FydDR2bDNaR19CQXBzSmxPSQ</guid></item><item><title>A Hidden Awakening in The Brain May Explain Why Females Age Slower - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOUzRfdVdNX2FHbDMyMFJ6TlE0c2ZqTjQ3N2JKRTVmUG1RaFhQUEJXc0dTdWlQeWJPNDkyTTNtWlRadUQ1NHRlNjBzM0l0YkZzTEpsaXdiSnBESnVSWjZ0Sk9uRWczTXlaWi02ajg0aUJiNFJIazNMZi1DcE5BdWpwMElmMGZKTnB2Y0JtWkVFd1dmOUFaV3pFLWk0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The 'silent' X chromosome within female brains may not be so silent after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found evidence in both mice and humans that as we age, 'sleeping' X chromosomes can be 'awakened' in brain cells critical to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlooked influence of this genetic library could be a key reason why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-humans-females-outlive-males-in-other-mammals-too"&gt;females live longer than males&lt;/a&gt; and exhibit slower cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/03/429571/silent-x-chromosome-gives-aging-female-brain-boost"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dena Dubal from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg" alt="Brain Cells Hippocampus" class="size-medium wp-image-154260" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-657x415.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes (green), in the hippocampus of the mouse brain. These cells often deteriorate during aging. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome harbors about 5 percent of the human genome, and it is largely understudied in the aging brain, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Dubal and her co-authors from UCSF, led by neurologist Margaret Gadek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female mammals possess two X chromosomes - one from each parent – but in each cell of the body, a random one of those chromosomes is silenced and the other is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some select genes from the X chromosome, however, can escape inactivation, and evidence suggests that as we grow older, more X chromosomes are not held down by genetic 'gag orders'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the expression of both X chromosomes could potentially drive the different ways that male and female brains age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, researchers investigated brain cells in the female hippocampus, which is a brain region strongly involved in learning, memory, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team studied mice with X chromosomes from two different rodent 'strains', &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus. &lt;/i&gt;In their models, the X chromosome in &lt;i&gt;M. musculus&lt;/i&gt; is missing an important gene, called Xist, which means it cannot be silenced like usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means in some of their offspring the &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/i&gt; X chromosome is always the one getting deactivated, so if its genetic effects show up in brain cells, then it is considered an "escapee".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png" alt="Mouse X Chromosomes" class="size-medium wp-image-154262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-454x415.png 454w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-768x702.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-600x548.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX.png 952w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; XX mice with an Xist deletion were crossed with XY &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; mice. XX progeny without an Xist deletion (left) underwent random X chromosome inactivation. XX progeny with an Xist deletion (right) harbor an active X chromosome strictly from the &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; strain and an inactive X chromosome from the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using RNA sequencing, researchers looked at the nuclei of 40,000 hippocampal cells in four young and four old female mice to figure out which X chromosome is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readings that rose from the X were 91.7 percent &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; and 8.3 percent&lt;em&gt; M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;. Because the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; X chromosome was supposed to be silenced, this suggests between 3 and 7 percent of its genes somehow escaped inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was true of most cell types in the mouse hippocampus, and more so in older brains. The cells most likely to express genes of the inactive X include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; neurons, which play a critical role in memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which support the formation of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if these findings extend to human brains, researchers at UCSF looked through previously published data on inactive X genes that change with age in at least one or more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of the aging-induced targets identified on the inactivated X chromosome caused human intellectual disability if mutated. This suggests that the inactivated X chromosome carries genes enriched for cognition-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these genes, called &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt;, particularly increases its expression with age in the neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of the dentate gyrus. The &lt;em&gt;PLP1 &lt;/em&gt;gene expresses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_proteolipid_protein"&gt;a protein involved in the formation of myelin sheaths&lt;/a&gt; that surround neurons and allow them to send messages more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In parallel to mice, older women showed increased &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; expression in the parahippocampus, compared to older men," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg" alt="Female Sex Chromosomes May Explain Why Some Brains Age Slower" class="size-medium wp-image-154428" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes in the mouse brain are shown in yellow. When expressed in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus, &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; improved cognition in aging mice. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the expression of the &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; gene in male and female mice improved cognition in the aging brain, enhancing learning and memory in the animal models. This could be a possible target for future treatments of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study of female-specific biology is historically underrepresented in science and medicine but is essential and expanding fervently," the team &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What X activation broadly means for women's brain health – or for other systems of the body – is now a critical area of investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-191683"&gt;twice as high&lt;/a&gt; in men as in women, and new research points to a potential reason why: a normally benign protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) protein is not normally a threat, and is important in regulating cellular energy use in the brain. However, the new research shows that in some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="153473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; cases, the immune system mistakes PINK1 for an enemy, attacking brain cells that express the protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, led by a team from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, the PINK1-related damage done by the immune system's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; is much more widespread and aggressive in the brains of men than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg" alt="Parkinsons graphic" class="wp-image-153476 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic-600x287.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied multiple proteins related to Parkinson's disease. (Williams et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sex-based differences in T cell responses were very, very striking," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "This immune response may be a component of why we see a sex difference in Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using blood samples from Parkinson's patients, the researchers tested the response of the T cells in the blood against a variety of proteins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10113022"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to Parkinson's – finding that PINK1 stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the male Parkinson's patients, the research team noticed a six-fold increase in T cells targeting PINK1-tagged brain cells, compared with healthy brains. In the female Parkinson's patients, there was only a 0.7-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15626-w"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; something similar happening with T cells and the alpha-synuclein protein. However, these reactions weren't common to all Parkinson's brains, which prompted the hunt for more antigens – substances that trigger immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is always the case with research of this type, once experts know more about how a disease gets started and how it progresses, that opens up new opportunities for finding ways to put a halt to the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We could potentially develop therapies to block these T cells, now that we know why the cells are targeting in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Cecilia Lindestam Arlehamn, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, being able to spot these PINK1-sensitive T cells in blood samples could lead to Parkinson's disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;being diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; at an earlier stage – which again helps with treatment and patient support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still waiting to discover a cure for Parkinson's disease, constant progress is being made in understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;the risk factors involved&lt;/a&gt; in its development, and new approaches &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;to tackling it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to expand to perform more global analysis of the disease progression and sex differences – considering all the different antigens, disease severities, and time since disease onset," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI180478"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Maryland resident with recent international travel has confirmed to be infected with a case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/One-Case-of-Measles-Confirmed-in-Maryland.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that a person who recently traveled internationally was confirmed to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The case was not associated with the current measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Out of an abundance of caution, health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contracting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights,” the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The department said anyone who was at Washington Dulles International Airport in Terminal A, on transportation to the main terminal and in the baggage claim area, on March 5 from 4 to 9 p.m. could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People could have been exposed if they also were at Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department from March 7 at 3:30 to 7:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a fever higher than 101 degrees, a runny nose, cough and red, watery eyes. A person will experience a red rash one to four days after early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A large outbreak in West Texas has &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5181254-second-measles-death-reported-as-outbreak-grows-in-southwest/"&gt;killed two people&lt;/a&gt;, making them the first U.S. measles deaths in a decade. State health officials in Texas say the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5171861-measles-outbreak-continues-spike/"&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of people in the San Antonio area could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly transmissible virus, as one infected person can infect 9 out of 10 people they come in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0nZ6HV5VA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive "wasting away," due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wA_fObLY6GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king's evil&lt;/a&gt;." This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the "robber of youth" due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249450/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

It affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., with most patients either dying or requiring a lung transplant within three to five years of diagnosis. Despite its severity, the disease has no known cause or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study has the potential to be a game changer,” said Dr. Paul Noble, chair of the Department of Medicine and co-senior author of the study. “We identified a root cause of IPF-related lung damage and a potential therapeutic target that might restore the lungs’ ability to heal themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract on how zinc works in the lungs.

These stem cells, known as type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), play a key role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-most-life-long-smokers-never-develop-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt;. Without sufficient zinc, their ability to regenerate is impaired, leading to worsening fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the molecular pathway responsible for this dysfunction, the team identified a potential method to restore lung healing. Their findings suggest that targeting this pathway could lead to treatments capable of reversing lung damage rather than just slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore this, the researchers developed a laboratory model of IPF using mice. This model allows them to test potential therapies in a controlled environment, providing a crucial step toward developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-ai-platform-significantly-improves-lung-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung organoids&lt;/a&gt;—miniature, simplified versions of organs grown from patient tissues. They found that cells missing the ZIP8 protein, which helps transport zinc into the cell, failed to regenerate and form colonies as healthy cells should. This highlighted ZIP8’s essential role in lung repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organoids with AEC2 cells that had the ZIP8 transporter were able to draw zinc into the cells, and then were able to regenerate and form more colonies,” said Carol Liang, MD, MBA, associate professor of Medicine and first author of the study. “The cells without ZIP8 didn’t have a way to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/zinc-can-improve-crop-yields-and-climate-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;draw zinc in&lt;/a&gt;, so they formed fewer colonies. This is how we determined that it is ZIP8 that allows the cells to use zinc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also used medication and deletion of the ZIP8 gene in mouse AEC2s to mimic IPF in laboratory mice. When they fed these mice a diet that included zinc supplements, their fibrosis improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been few detailed studies of how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-significant-link-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc works in the lungs&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dianhua Jiang, MD, PhD, professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study. “Ours is the first to identify the detailed function of zinc in lung biology, specifically in IPF. It was particularly exciting to discover that zinc regulates the production of two other key molecules that promote tissue regeneration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and Sirtuin1. These molecules have been implicated in tissue regeneration and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Role of zinc dysregulation in lung disease.

Despite the best efforts of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/could-wearable-devices-adversely-affect-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, IPF remains a major public health concern, affecting more people each year as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer hope for patients and their families who have been impacted by this devastating condition.

Societies around the world are "&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1487139/full" target="_blank"&gt;dismally unprepared&lt;/a&gt;" for an aging population, Foo wrote in the science journal Frontiers last month, and with his co-authors described AI and other technologies as "pivotal forces with the potential to drive a paradigm shift in healthcare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Foo, artificial intelligence is set to play a "huge" role in elderly care in Singapore, both in terms of helping clinicians manage non-acute conditions and in overseeing administrative tasks such as monitoring the availability of hospital beds, he said in an email to CNBC. "As the elderly in Singapore get more IT savvy, we see them turning to teleconsultations and digital tools that utilize AI technology," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is also being used to detect diseases earlier, an area of personal interest for Dr Han Ei Chew, a research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. He said his late mother's diabetic eye disease could have been diagnosed — and treated — earlier had AI testing methods been available when she was alive, as they are are now. "That would have been so useful when the family was going through that journey," Chew told CNBC by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big focus for Singapore is "aging in place," according to Chew. "We can deploy the AI, but it isn't about fully replacing human care ... it is really about assisting the caregivers and helping seniors to stay independent and age in place," he told CNBC via video call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chew said Singapore's Housing and Development Board is even offering built-in home technology to &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/smart-hdb-town-page/assistive-living-technologies" target="_blank"&gt;detect when someone falls&lt;/a&gt; down, with an alert sent to a resident's next of kin or connected to a call center for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of monitoring technology need to be used carefully, Chew said, in whatever jurisdiction they are deployed. "The AI should empower the seniors and not strip them of control. They still need to have the choice to opt in, set boundaries, and, more importantly, to turn it off when they want," he told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A care 'co-pilot'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not only Singapore that is looking at using AI for elderly care. In the United States, Sensi.AI is a fast-growing "care co-pilot" that monitors elderly people using audio devices that are usually plugged into three areas of their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company co-founder and CEO Romi Gubes said the technology can provide caregivers with more than 100 different insights, alerting them to early signs of urinary tract or respiratory infections, or to falls or cognitive decline. "We're combining multiple indicators that are coming from audio," Gubes told CNBC by video call. "Think about, for example, respiratory infection. This will [take into account] the cadence of the coughing, the frequency, the type of coughing, together with ... complaints around fever, dizziness," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sensi.AI is installed in a home, it creates a "baseline" over two weeks, noting a range of "acoustic indicators," Gubes said, including non-verbal sounds like objects being moved, footsteps or snores, which it combines with its team's clinical knowledge. Once the AI knows the baseline sounds in a home, it can alert caregivers to any audio anomalies that might suggest a health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubes said Sensi is being used by "tens of thousands" of seniors in the U.S. and a spokesperson said the company is in discussions about a potential expansion in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ageism in AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts CNBC spoke to warned that AI must be used carefully when it comes to senior health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foo warned that the over-use of AI in consultations might lead to "poorer health outcomes" as not all elderly people can use technology, and he warned that it must be correctly designed to avoid "perpetuating digital ageism." Indeed, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/09-02-2022-ensuring-artificial-intelligence-(ai)-technologies-for-health-benefit-older-people" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt;, "The implicit and explicit biases of society, including around age, are often replicated in AI technologies," and its 2022 &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/351503/9789240040793-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;policy brief&lt;/a&gt; urged developers to have older people participate in the design of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Singapore, the government's "&lt;a href="https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/3/b1fd5713-8ff9-46d5-9911-0f233f2a8b31/refreshed-action-plan-for-successful-ageing-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Action Plan for Successful Ageing&lt;/a&gt;" details its aims, such as to reach 550,000 seniors with a health and wellness program and reduce hospital deaths from 61% to 51% between 2023 and 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Foo said seniors' opinions needed to be taken into account when determining how AI can address their health needs. "Like all new initiatives, failure will be inevitable if the target audience, i.e. the elderly, are not on board. We [need] to hear their voices and tailor the national health-AI strategy to suit their needs while not removing the human element of healthcare. That is the challenge," he told CNBC by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chew, the approach to elderly care will need to blend human and machine, describing it as "high tech, but high touch." "The AI is probably best used as an extra set of eyes, ears and the robots [are an] extra set of hands, but not as a replacement for the high touch human care giving," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 23:06:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPLU96TlJCQjJQdXgzYW4yZGVPSnhpWlRLaGxDQTgyQ0NHV0p3OWZFU2VaRDE2aHZQa01rcTVKWndmZVdnaXFYX1NxZFBRZ05oazVjbmFUNVBoOHY1QWRWSVdJNHY5a1VQZ2trX3kzVlZQNTJYcTNXdWlTTHZ2X3pnNHRzajhDRWFWVjdjdG5qQXRrMVNObmFPakJ1Q2JkdHd2Rkg5bTNLT1XSAa4BQVVfeXFMTlU0QXFIamE1RkFGUWlPd2xLbDh6czFwNVJnNVJydXNTVXZ4MXpsdUotOUoycllDZ01rZlNRZnpVb29MN1hMU3JvMktpTXhvTU1qY0RYU2E4dWNrRGFJaUduYmFRSG1FUnJJaGpMWDJlakJpdGQ1bUhMbjNTb1FtMW9BbHRwcUdLT0YtSS1VV3NNWExOUDV4blNnZmhucUdQbUVQN290M25uQXd1T3BB</guid></item><item><title>This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQb3BxOG16SlRqSUp3SHNrNlFDakZReHg0NjluYnR2MTJfZXRORmhVLU9mTXhFOTJZMGduZlhCaHFoOUlOa0RWQWlKVnF6Zkpuem81M1lhYlZyVUdmUEFLY0hVd0VxbjJmaUtxaXQ5TXJRb0NBR21vNGpUaWUxU3JrSGNnbEVUc1dPNGJQcy1tY2ZZYUdRWF9vTTk4V1ZkaEdhYXQ5V2ZCaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C_elegans_cell_and_nucleus_sizes.svg"&gt;J.J.Froehlich/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that gene activity associated with caloric restriction could be seen in the kidney and liver tissues of mice treated with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, some of the changes that caloric restriction gives in animals and thought to confer certain health benefits also appear with a hypertension drug that many people already take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery was that a biological signaling receptor called nish-1 was crucial in the effectiveness of rilmenidine. This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure.

&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go yet in figuring out if rilmenidine would work as an anti-aging drug for actual humans, but the early signs in these worm and mice tests are promising. We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A component found in all fungi may provide a shield that prevents flu-related lung damage, according to a new Canadian study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preclinical trial uncovered how beta-glucan—which is found in all mushrooms, and also yeast, oats, and barley—can ‘reprogram’ immune cells to prevent lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, demonstrated that administering the compound to mice before their exposure to influenza, reduced lung damage, improve lung function and lowered the risk of illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists led by Professor Maziar Divangahi discovered that a unique structure of this component can boost defenses against pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most research focuses on stopping the virus from replicating, this study explored how to regulate the body’s immunity to infection, a concept known as “disease tolerance.” The researchers discovered that beta-glucan significantly enhanced flu survival rates by modulating immune responses and preventing severe lung inflammation, a common cause of fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-024-02041-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;, highlight beta-glucan as a promising therapy for influenza, as well as other emerging viral pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable how beta-glucan can reprogram certain immune cells, such as neutrophils, to control excessive inflammation in the lung,” &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said first author&lt;/a&gt; Nargis Khan, who conducted this research at McGill and is now an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neutrophils are traditionally known for causing inflammation, but beta-glucan has the ability to shift their role to reduce it,” added co-first author Kim Tran, who recently completed her Ph.D. at McGill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-medicinal-value-of-chaga-mushrooms-as-a-nutraceutical-for-good-health/" rel="bookmark"&gt;The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rebalancing the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flu-related deaths aren’t caused by the virus itself, but by an overreaction of the immune system, said the researchers. This suggests the true danger lies in the host’s own immune response. However, how the immune system becomes so imbalanced remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beta-glucan is found in the cell walls of all fungi, including some that live in and on our bodies as part of the human microbiome,” explained Divangahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is tempting to hypothesize that the levels and composition of fungi in an individual could influence how their immune system responds to infections, in part because of beta-glucan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flu season underway and the looming threat of bird flu (H5N1), developing effective therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases is more critical than ever, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

Some families &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/tag/recipes" target="_blank"&gt;have recipes&lt;/a&gt; they are sworn never to share with outsiders. Other folks have tricks they use at work that give them a competitive advantage that could be used against them if they let it out of the bag. Other people use secret techniques &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/the-3-step-harvard-conversation-trick-that-makes-shy-people-more-likable-ex1" target="_blank"&gt;to be likable&lt;/a&gt; but fear being seen as manipulative if they share them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own “secret sauce” that makes them unique. A couple of hundred of them were very kind and shared those secret life hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hvqz4d/whats_a_life_hack_so_good_you_almost_dont_want_to/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a recent social media post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where someone asked, “What’s a life hack so good you almost don’t want to share it?” They received over 3500 responses, and we culled the best from them to make our readers’ lives easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice covers everything from how to win an argument to finding precious metals at your local second-hand store. The life hacks that are “so good” also include ways to prevent potentially aggravating people from getting in your face and the power of learning how to smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 17 life hacks that are “so good” that people almost didn’t want to share them. (Thankfully, they did.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. That's where it goes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If you look for something and it's not in the first place you look, THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE IT GOES. So when you find it, put it in the first place you looked for it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. How to argue (from a lawyer)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When arguing about something, ask what their interests ('why' they want/don’t want something) are rather than their position. Usually, it’s easier to come to an agreement if you approach a conflict from this angle. Also, conceding a minor point during the argument 'you’re right about x' and 'I don’t disagree with y' tends to lessen the guard of your opposition and thus making it easier to get what you want out of them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I just saw something similar to this. If you and another person are arguing over who gets a lemon, you’ll eventually agree to just cut it in half. But if you ask why they want the lemon, you’ll find out one person wants to juice it and one person wants the skin for zest for a recipe, so each party can have 100% of what they want if they just take the time to see the 'why' of the other person."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Whenever arguing with someone and it's going round and round trying to come up with a compromise, ask 'what does a solution look like to you?' Half the time they got no clue the other half is something you willing to compromise. It has cut down every single argument in my relationship."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. How to stop a 'Karen' in their tracks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I work as a receptionist, and my supervisor always asks me how our guests like me even if they are rude to other staff. My trick is when someone is checking in that looks like a typical Karen I always give them a compliment like 'where did you get your nails done? They are so pretty!' It usually works."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I used be in maintenance for a huge school district. Whenever I was sent to a school where the office staff had a reputation for being cranky complainy crabby pants, I had a whole song and dance I'd run through when I got there. I'd walk into the office with a big smile, acting like the nicest person in the world, just a big dumb puppy who has no idea this is a "crabby admin" school. Then, when the timing is right, I'd let slip the casual comment of 'I really like coming to this school, everyone is so nice!' It's like a magic spell. The grumpuses always tried to live up to my unrealistic view of them, and were always at least reasonable, if not downright pleasant. It always felt like cheating, but really all I was doing was setting an example they wanted to follow."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Buy the same socks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Find a pair of socks you really like. Buy like.... 40 pairs. Throw out your other socks. No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;w you can just grab any two socks and have a pair. Get a hole in one? Throw it out. You still have tons of others of the same."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. The 3 hobbies rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I was thinking about what I need to be happy, and came to the conclusion that I need 3 hobbies: one creative, one physical, and one social. For social, I do board game nights weekly. This ensures I have something planned for the week to look forward to. For physical, I go to the gym, which, to be honest, I hate and have always hated, so I took up bouldering too. This is a great hobby because it can also be very social, and it's also just fun. And for creative, I dabble in things like drawing, knitting, and other needlework. I also throw in reading here too, because it can make you think and imagine. If you play D&amp;amp;D, this can also combine with social. I've been extremely happy since figuring out for myself. I've always had a list of hobbies I want to try, but this helps me organize them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Learn how to smile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A genuine looking— and I say looking because it doesn’t need to actually be genuine, smile. It will disarm people making them more comfortable around you, you’ll be more likely to get dates, you’ll be more likely to get jobs, you’ll be more likely to make friends, your dating profile will look better, your wedding pics will look better, hell your social media will look better. Learn how to smile. Look it up on YouTube."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. The bathroom test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Being in the restaurant business for over 20 years now, if you go into a restaurant and their bathrooms are dirty, then get out of there. It means most likely, of course, not always, that their kitchen is just as dirty. If the general manager doesn’t care about what the guests can see, he’s definitely not caring about what the guest can’t see and that gets you such a higher chance of food poisoning."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Wake up a little earlier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Getting up consistently to start your day at a reasonable hour - regardless of intent to go anywhere or do anything - really does give you extra time in the week to get sh*t done."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. How to make someone like you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"To get someone to like you, ask them two questions, then after the second one, validate their response. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat. That's it. It's alarmingly effective. Just ask them any question about something they seem like they might want to talk about. hobbies or job or whatever. if you dont know anything about them, ask about the best place they've traveled, or would like to go if they haven't traveled. then, whatever they say, just ask a follow-up question about it. Then whatever they say to that, just say something positive that supports their opinion. it can be as simple as  'that seems really cool' or something more specific that shows you've been listening and agree/support them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Visualize your life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Ask yourself what your ideal happy life would look like, and then isolate each aspect as an objective to work towards, always breaking down larger goals into smaller doable steps. Makes things seem less daunting and gives you feasable objectives to work towards."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Know the goal of the conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Before entering any difficult conversation, conflict, apology, request, etc, you should know what your goal of the conversation for yourself is. What do you want the outcome to be? How do you want this interaction to end? How do you want both parties to be left feeling? Know this first, then practice running both sides in your head a few times. Crucially, this prepares you direct the conversation for the outcome you want, instead of just saying what you really want say. Know your goal, and you’re way more likely to reach it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;12. Thrift store jewelry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Second-hand shops—check the jewelry because, funnily enough, the volunteers working there probably don't know much about gold. I make a fair good chunk of cash a year going through jewelry at thrift stores."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13. Bake bacon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Piece of parchment paper over any type of pan. Bam, no mess. People boiling it in skillets on the stove are living in the stone age."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;14. How to talk to new people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When the conversation starts to die or needs a pick me up, ask what the people around you did that day. It sounds really simple, but not a lot of people get asked this question regularly, so it’s likely you’ll get a genuine answer and make the person feel like you’re interested and invested. This is my hack for work events, family you haven’t seen in ages, or a friend of a friend you just met and your mutual friend just left you two alone. I think it’s safe to assume it would be a good icebreaker on a first date as well."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15. Self-control through pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The only thing in control of your mind and body is you. Go stand out in the rain and fight the instinct to flee inside. Find your zen. Overcome your base instincts and then figure out how to apply them to the rest of your life. Hunger, anxiety, self-esteem issues, etc, all things to overcome, master, and control."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;16. Easy investment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Invest (a portion of ) every paycheck into an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund. It’s easy, the fees are incredibly low (nobody seems to understand mutual funds that are not index charge a fee! and if you do it consistently you will end up with money. Proven through depressions, recessions, and large-scale wars. That is all."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;17. Know their name&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When a customer service person (finally) answers the phone and says 'my name is [NAME], [something something] how can I help you?' I make a note of their name and say, "Hi [NAME], how's it going/how are you doing?" in a friendly, conversational tone before introducing myself &amp;amp; my issue. Customer service is a soulless job and involves dealing with a lot of belligerent people, so setting the tone and establishing a rapport by mentioning their names makes it a little more personal and tends to lead to better outcomes.

And when it comes to visceral fat, it’s not about appearance; reducing it is truly about protecting your well-being. That’s where your diet comes into play. Some foods may make a huge difference when it comes to managing visceral fat and supporting overall health. Among the many nutritional powerhouses out there, one protein-rich food stands out for its unique benefits—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike the fat just beneath your skin, visceral fat isn’t visible, making it tricky to detect. And not because you can’t see it means it doesn’t affect you. In fact, this type of fat can significantly impact your health. Excess visceral fat has been linked to a higher risk of several serious health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even certain types of cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data supports the notion that eating pistachios might be linked to reduced visceral fat. One study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; showed that when people with at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome snacked on tree nuts (like pistachios) instead of typical carbohydrate-heavy snacks (like chips or cookies) for 16 weeks, improvements in measures of visceral fat were observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what makes them one of the best choices for reducing visceral fat?

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-pistachios-support-visceral-fat-reduction"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Pistachios Support Visceral Fat Reduction &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Let’s be clear—no single food will reduce visceral fat, especially if you are not making appropriate overall dietary and lifestyle changes that support this outcome. But if you are taking steps to minimize this dangerous type of abdominal fat, including pistachios in the mix may help you see the results you want to see. Here are four reasons why dietitians recommend pistachios as a top pick for a visceral fat-reducing diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pistachios are one of the best foods for reducing visceral fat, partly thanks to their rich content of healthy fats. “Pistachios are a good source of healthy fat, namely unsaturated fatty acids, which are considered cardioprotective. Saturated fats, on the other hand, are implicated in increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and potentially additional visceral fat buildup,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.amandagodmannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda Godman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in pistachios play a crucial role in combating unhealthy fat accumulation. Monounsaturated fats, for instance, help improve lipid profiles by lowering LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol while increasing HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol levels. This enhances overall cardiovascular health, which is closely linked to maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing abdominal fat. Additionally, these fats help regulate insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing visceral fat storage, as unchecked insulin resistance can lead to fat buildup around the abdomen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Data shows that consuming monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat is linked to not only a reduction in body fat but also a difference in where fat is stored. In a 2022 study, when people ate a diet rich in saturated fat, most of the fat they gained was deposited in the abdomen as visceral fat. Those who followed a monounsaturated fat-rich diet lost weight and did not accumulate fat as visceral fat in the same way.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed With Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A single ounce of pistachios provides roughly 6 grams of protein, making them one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-8423784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich nuts&lt;/a&gt;. Protein plays a role in fat loss as it boosts energy expenditure through the thermic effect of food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting and metabolizing protein than fats or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, consuming high-protein foods like pistachios helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss, ensuring that the body prioritizes burning visceral fat rather than muscle tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gerontology&lt;/em&gt; showed that, among older men, consuming more protein may be linked to decreased visceral abdominal fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Abundant in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antioxidants play a role in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, which are both linked to visceral fat accumulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the powerful antioxidants in pistachios are lutein, beta-carotene and polyphenols. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage and promoting overall metabolic health. Studies have shown that diets rich in antioxidants can support better fat metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are essential for minimizing visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt; suggest the possible benefit of an antioxidant diet in relieving visceral obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low In Calories &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Pistachios can support fat loss and metabolic health due to their lower calorie density (160 calories per ounce versus 180–200 in other nuts),” shares &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, an Orlando-based registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This balance of high-protein and low-calorie density makes pistachios an ideal choice for those seeking to reduce visceral fat while enjoying a tasty and convenient snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One serving of pistachios equals about 49 kernels, making it one of the most generous serving sizes for nuts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The low-calorie nature of pistachios, combined with their high fiber and protein content, helps regulate hunger and reduce the likelihood of eating too much throughout the day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reducing visceral fat is essential to improve your long-term health and lower your risk of severe chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. While no single food can guarantee fat loss, pistachios can help support your efforts when combined with other healthy lifestyle practices such as regular exercise, stress management and adequate sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed as a standalone snack or incorporated into meals, pistachios’ versatility and nutritional profile—rich in healthy fats, protein and antioxidants and low in calories—make them a valuable asset in lowering visceral fat. Remember, the key to success lies in overall balance and dedication to making informed, proactive choices about your well-being.&lt;br&gt;

One in three people over 65 have cataracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;More than half of NHS cataract procedures in England are outsourced to private providers as part of a collaboration between the NHS and the ­private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.4"&gt;&lt;div id="acf5bfcf-91df-4d16-b79d-ddfb9596d7ee"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cataract surgery is the most common operation in the NHS, with more than 400,000 people having procedures each year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GOC/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Optegra, which runs 17 NHS hospitals and clinics, conducted 50,000 NHS cataract operations last year. Alastair Stuart, the Optegra medical director and a consultant ophthalmic surgeon, said: “Normally after a cataract removal procedure, patients leave with a rather intense drop regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“They have four different types of drops which they need to take three or four times a day, for up to four weeks. This is quite a commitment and hassle for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Due to medical advances we are now able to apply a steroid injection as part of the surgical procedure, which eliminates the need for any drops whatsoever. This is revolutionary for patients’ post-operative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“On top of this, we provide treatment for both eyes on the same day. While we do this regularly for private patients, the normal pathway for NHS patients is to have one eye treated and then return several weeks later for the second eye.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-waiting-list-pilot-ai-patient-risk-score-mw2v0pc76" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;App spots patients at risk and moves them up the NHS waiting list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Stuart explained that the imbalance between the eyes in the weeks between surgeries can “be quite uncomfortable and make people feel unsteady”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “By treating both eyes on one day the patient leaves with excellent vision in both eyes, which immediately decreases the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“By completing the pre-operative ­diagnostic tests and consultation on the day of treatment, patients have been delighted to reduce the number of visits to the hospital, especially if they have a distance to travel and are relying on friends or family to be available — also as the patient cannot drive themselves home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While each of these elements have been successfully carried out before, this is the first time all three have been offered to patients at once. Five patients were treated at the Hampshire clinic last week as part of the trial, with hundreds more due to participate this month. Drop-free surgery will also be rolled out to all NHS patients at ­Optegra clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Those benefiting include Jim Hayles, 70, from Southampton, who said: “Two eyes at the same time means I do not have to worry about having two ops and two lots of everything, so yes, that’s great. I’ve also been told that normally you would have drops for four weeks, at different times of day, so you have to remember to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This procedure means you don’t have to have drops at all, which is going to be brilliant because I can just walk out of here and within a day or two, take the covers off and that’s it. I don’t have to worry about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Maria Walmsey, 78, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, has struggled with reading and cooking because of her ­cataracts. She said: “It’s got progressively worse and impacts on everyday life, in everything you are doing — whether hobbies or just in general.

It’s not that women are more likely to be homosexual or bisexual — it’s that women appear more willing than men to change their minds about what turns them on, throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tend to choose a sexuality and stick with it, experts agree. Women are wildcards.

After following the same 100 women for a decade, she found that there were crucial differences between bisexuality and the sexual fluidity that otherwise heterosexual women experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/sad-but-common-signs-your-marriage-already-over"&gt;12 Sad But Common Signs Your Marriage Is Already Over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/dr-lori-bisbey/am-i-bisexual-what-being-bisexual-really-means-to-me-at-least"&gt;Bisexuality is defined as&lt;/a&gt; being attracted to men and women. Many women, Diamond found, identified as gay or straight, but accepted the fact that they might change their minds at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When experts say that women are more likely to be fluid, they mean that they’re more likely to make an exception to, or even update, their identities. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does not mean that women are more likely than men to cheat on their spouses and fluidity is seldom the main cause of a relationship souring. As with any relationship problem, there are usually other, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-someone-problem-relationship-even-though-they-pretend-not-to-be"&gt;deeper relationship issues&lt;/a&gt; at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, more than ever, married women are stepping away from problem heterosexual marriages, and into same-sex ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen a mild increase in my practice of women in their 30s over the last decade,” &lt;a href="https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Kingsberg-Sheryl-1861418675" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheryl Kingsberg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and division chief of behavioral medicine in the OB/GYN unit at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center told In Style. “Maybe it’s hormonal, maybe it’s neuroendocrine — an epigenetic shift in brain chemistry that is hormone-based. But it’s certainly a shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hormonal explanation may be that women’s testosterone levels increase with age, and higher testosterone levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3138231/#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20a%20high%20concentration%20of%20testosterone,to%20a%20female%2Dtypical%20orientation%20(attraction%20to%20men)." rel="nofollow"&gt;have also been linked&lt;/a&gt; with an increased incidence of homosexuality and bisexuality in women. &lt;a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/87097/13/Kanazawa_Possible_evolutionary_origins_of_human_female_sexual_fluidity_AAM.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to psychological theories,&lt;/a&gt; this might help explain why women may be more fluid in their thirties and forties, after having kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/2024377641/when-shes-about-cheat-she-does-these-things"&gt;The 4 Silent 'Tells' A Woman Is About To Cheat And Blow Up Her Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evolutionary psychologists have offered several theories as to why women may be more fluid as well, such as an adaptive way to decrease conflict in polygamous cultures.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825779/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Another popular explanation&lt;/a&gt; is that, because saying yes to intimacy comes at a higher risk and reproductive cost to women, they tend to make decisions more cautiously on a case-by-case basis, which could potentially allow for more deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, likely, increased rates of fluidity among women are primarily a social (rather than biological) phenomenon. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that men have the same potential as women to be fluid, but that stigma prevents them from acting upon it. In most Western societies, women still face fewer social costs for same-sex relationships than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if one gender is more fluid than the other,” clinical social worker Alisha Powell Powell explained. “But I think that one is much more widely accepted than the other.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer-mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/bizarre-way-discovered-wife-having-affair-inside-home"&gt;The Bizarre Way I Discovered My Wife Was Having An Affair Inside Our Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Vinopal is a freelance journalist who writes about health and science.

&lt;p&gt;A Howard County resident tested positive for measles after returning from international travel, according to the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles case is not associated with the measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations during the following hours may have been exposed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington Dulles International Airport: The international arrivals area&lt;br&gt;March 5th: 4 p.m. - 9 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department&lt;br&gt;March 7th: 3:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health, the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials are looking to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who may have been exposed should contact their healthcare provider for additional guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also call Howard County Health Department’s Infectious Disease Surveillance and Response Program at 410-313-6284 or the Virginia Department Health at (804) 363-2704 or email epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your plump, firm, unwilted, and vibrant asparagus washed and ready to go, let’s study up on some of the most common stalk mistakes so you can steer clear of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the chefs we spoke with, try to avoid the following common faux pas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting it get parched.&lt;/strong&gt; For maximum flavor and the best texture, it’s ideal to cook your asparagus as soon as possible after you pick it from the garden or the supermarket. If you plan to cook it later, don’t &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-store-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; it dry. Instead, keep it like you would with flowers. Trim the ends and place the asparagus, spears up, in a jar that has about half an inch of water. Cover loosely with a plastic bag, and change the water daily. Alternatively, wrap the trimmed ends in a damp paper towel, tuck the asparagus in a plastic bag, and store them in your refrigerator’s &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-a-crisper-drawer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;crisper drawer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping the trim.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common mistake home cooks make related to asparagus is forgetting to trim the stems, says Chef Mary Payne Moran of Los Angeles. The stem can be extremely tough, woody, and not very tasty, adds cookbook author Yumna Jawad of Grand Rapids. Plan on cutting off about 1 to 2 inches from the bottom of the spears or at the point where stalks change from green to pale green or white. If the stalks are extremely thick at the ends, consider using a vegetable peeler to shave off the outermost layer or two, says Chef Adam Fiscus of New York City. Save any trimmed pieces for &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-vegetable-stock-out-of-kitchen-scraps/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetable stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking low and slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Asparagus can handle the heat, Jawad confirms. Don’t be afraid to crank things up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) when roasting or grilling, or even 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) if you like charred edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepping it wet.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cooking asparagus in any other way besides steaming or blanching, it's crucial to dry the asparagus well after washing. “If it has too much moisture on it, it will likely steam instead of cooking as you intended, so make sure to pat it dry well to get the best texture,” Jawad explains.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though asparagus is a vegetable, it contains some natural sugars, which caramelize when roasted, Jawad notes. This lends nuttiness and slightly sweeter flavor, plus each stalk can cook evenly—and with very little fuss. If you allow enough space between the stalks, “there is no watery residue, and the bite is crunchy with a hint of chew,” Moran explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Roasting deepens the flavor so the tips get a bit crispy, plus it’s also easy,” says cookbook author Peter Som of New York City.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then evenly space out the stalks in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Moran suggests avoiding pans that are very dark in color, as this can lead to uneven cooking. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and the thickest part of the asparagus is fork-tender.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grilling, blanching, and steaming in the microwave all deserve honorable mentions and will certainly satisfy depending on your goals and personal preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Grilling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For results similar to roasting but achievable al fresco, Fiscus is fond of grilling. “Asparagus cooked this way looks great and tastes amazing, adding elegance to any plated protein dish,” he explains. It’s also versatile. As a tip, Fiscus likes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19620/easy-and-tasty-all-purpose-marinade/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;marinate&lt;/a&gt; his vegetables for 30 minutes to a few hours to infuse each bite with extra flavor. Still, grilling didn’t get quite as many upvotes because it requires more gear and optimal weather…or a really warm coat and some thick skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat your grill to high, or around 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil or vinaigrette per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then add the asparagus in a single layer on the grill grates. Cook, turning often with tongs, until lightly charred and fork-tender (about 3 to 5 minutes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Blanching &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might be a bit ho-hum to enjoy on its own as a side dish. However, if you plan to put your cooked asparagus to use in salads or crudité platters, blanching is a brilliant option, Som says. “You’ll get the bright green color with that tender crisp texture,” he explains, which pairs perfectly with a &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8391899/apple-cider-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bright vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286167/instant-pot-jammy-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;jammy egg&lt;/a&gt;, or your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/most-saved-dip-recipe-8775965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dip recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blanch asparagus, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add washed and trimmed asparagus stalks to the water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, erring on the longer side for thicker asparagus. Once the color appears even more vibrant, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched asparagus to a bowl of ice water. Chill for 2 minutes, then remove, pat dry, and enjoy as desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Steaming in the Microwave &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Director of Culinary Matt Larkin of New York City admits, “My secret asparagus tip is to microwave it.” True, it might sound like a humble shortcut, but steaming gives the spears a crisp-tender quality similar to blanching—but without waiting for a pot of water to boil and preparing an ice bath. It leaps and bounds above boiling, according to Moran, since you don’t end up with the wet residue that tends to occur post-boil. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wash and trim the asparagus, then place it in a single layer on a plate. Cover the stalks with a damp paper towel, then microwave for about 3 minutes, or until the center is tender when you pierce it with a knife.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all these methods, you're now equipped for a season full of delicious asparagus.&lt;br&gt;

Usually, one to four days after the early symptoms, a red rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles symptoms typically develop 10-14 days after exposure to the virus but can develop as soon as seven days and as long as 21 days after exposure.

People who develop a fever or other symptoms of measles should not go to childcare, school, work, or out in public, and should contact their health care provider. They should call their health care provider first rather than showing up in the waiting room or emergency room so that the office can take measures to prevent spread to other patients.Measles cases do occur sporadically in Maryland with one case of measles identified in Maryland in 2024, one in 2023, and no cases from 2020-2022.This report will be updated.

"It was a dark moment. I have lost many friends from different types of cancers, and so my first thought was, 'I'm done.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley had 15 inches of her colon removed. She then met with Dr. Mark Lewis, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health, and told him she was concerned about the side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she was eligible for another type of treatment: immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of patients, understandably, when you tell them they require chemotherapy, will refuse it, so it is incredibly appealing to patients that we now have another option to treat cancer, and that's immunotherapy," Lewis said. "The entire point is to turn on the immune system and allow the patient's own body to destroy the cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is a candidate for immunotherapy, and Lewis noted with this kind of treatment, there is a risk of developing an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to pretend that these treatments have absolutely no side effects, but for the most part, these treatments are far more tolerable than chemotherapy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley went in for an IV every three weeks for two years. She experienced nausea at first but said she had no other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very successful, and I'm in remission," she said. "I feel great. I feel really good. Strong and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cancer journey hasn't been easy, but she has remained positive, focusing on her family and her religion. She's now encouraging others to make their health a priority, especially since she didn't experience any signs or symptoms before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eva Brinley rings a bell signifying she has finished her cancer treatment. (Photo: Eva Brinley)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just can't stress enough how important it is to do those checkups," she said. "Stay healthy. Eat right. Have your checkups, and be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. While some people may not have any symptoms, like Eva, warning signs of colon cancer may include persistent or progressive abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, such as constipation or diarrhea, blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend people at average risk of colon cancer begin screening at age 45.

    &lt;p&gt;There have never been more supplements on the supermarket shelves, or in our kitchen cupboards, as millions of us strive for better health and hope to achieve it through consuming a pill or powder. Around two-thirds of adults in the UK &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/supplements-worth-taking1/"&gt;take some form of supplement&lt;/a&gt; – that’s the equivalent of 81 million supplements a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made by isolating nutrients from plants and animals, whether we’re looking for improved immunity, increased energy or better sleep, it’s easy to treat supplements as medicines. But they’re not, and they’re not regulated like medicines either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, food supplements are regulated under the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, which align with EU and UK food laws. They must comply with general food safety legislation and cannot make misleading health claims. But, unlike medicines, supplements are not as strictly regulated and do not undergo the same rigorous testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while most supplements should be safe, whether or not they do what they say on the tin is another question. The fact that what’s available online might be from abroad and outside UK and EU rules, alongside the statistic that four in five consumers never check the ingredients label anyway, and you might be wondering just how to tell if that pricey supplement you picked up is going to do you any good at all…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first – are pricey supplements the answer? The marketing of some luxury supplements – think Lyma, where a 30-day supply of their signature supplement aimed at improving sleep, lowering stress and increasing skin and hair health costs £199 – suggests more money spent means a more effective supplement. But prices for what seem to be the same product can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/magnesium-health-benefits-body-supplements-immunity/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; as an example. At Holland &amp;amp; Barrett, a bottle of 30 tablets containing 375mg per tablet costs £3.99, or 13p per tablet. If you choose Inessa Magnesium, you’ll get 60 capsules containing 153mg per capsule for £24.99 – working out at around 42p per tablet, for less than half the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pills both contain slightly different combinations of types and sources of magnesium, so it depends on what you’re looking for, and while sometimes, price point does indicate a better product, this is not always the case, insist the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marketing plays a massive role in supplement pricing,” says Nichola Ludlam-Raine a registered specialist dietitian. “This can create a perception that they are far superior to cheaper alternatives, even if the core ingredients are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, high street own-brand supplements can be just as effective as premium supplement brands. The key factors to consider are the ingredients, dosages, and third-party testing rather than branding alone. I often suggest my patients choose supermarket own brand supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are you paying for when you buy more expensive supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy premium supplements, you’re often paying for branding and marketing. “Luxury supplement brands invest heavily in high-end packaging, influencer partnerships, and advertising.” These, of course, make no difference to how good the product is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other reasons too. “Some premium brands use patented or trademarked versions of vitamins and minerals,” explains Ludlam-Raine, which may have enhanced bioavailability (better absorption) or research backing, and are therefore worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High-end brands may combine multiple beneficial ingredients into one formula, such as added adaptogens, nootropics, or probiotics, which could be worth paying extra for, if you want them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains: “Some premium brands undergo more rigorous third-party testing to ensure purity, potency, and absence of contaminants.” But as with any supplement, you must check if this is the case – don’t assume that the price point means these tests have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a high-street supplement has the same form and dosage of an active ingredient as a luxury brand, it can be just as effective,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Ultimately, it’s important to read labels, check dosages, and choose reputable brands rather than relying solely on price as an indicator of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The NHS recommends most people should get their nutrients from food, but some groups may need supplements, including those where a health care professional has said that there is a deficiency – which can be determined via a blood test,’”explains Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine recommends following the NHS advice on vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, vitamin B12, iodine, iron, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;supplement with vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; daily during the winter months (taking 10mcg/400IU from October to March), or all year round if you are: pregnant or breastfeeding, over 65, have darker skin or spend very little time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant, have diabetes, a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/bmi-calculator/"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; over 30, or take certain epilepsy medications, you should supplement with folic acid. Take 5mg daily at least three months before pregnancy and for the first 12 weeks to prevent neural tube defects, or take 5mg daily if you belong to any of the other groups mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin B12, calcium, iron, iodine, and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegans and those who avoid animal products may want to consider taking a supplement that provides these nutrients, which are not available from non-animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure, speak to a GP, pharmacist, or registered dietitian before taking supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Look for a clear ingredient list&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ingredients list should be transparent and detailed,” says Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports and exercise medic. It should include the specific form of the vitamins and minerals included, as well as the amount. (For example, if your supplement contains vitamin A as beta-carotene, that is safe in pregnancy – whereas vitamin A in the form of retinol is not, points out Ludlam-Raine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Check the dose is correct&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying with the NHS guidance on upper limits is key,’ says Ludlam-Raine. The recommended limits are listed on their &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Equally, check if there is actually a reasonable amount of your recommended daily allowance in the supplement, says Dr Ogunkoya – something might highlight a certain popular vitamin or mineral on the front of the packet but contain a relatively small amount, he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Choose an evidence-based formulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means its claims have been third-party tested or the dosage matches what’s proven in clinical studies, advises Dr Ogunkoya, as well as that the nutrients are present in their most bioavailable form, says Ludlam-Raine. “For example, there are two forms of vitamin D available in supplements: D3 and D2. Both can help correct vitamin D deficiency, but most doctors recommend D3 because it is slightly more active and therefore slightly more effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Check the certificate of analysis of the products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means it has been lab-tested to prove that it meets the criteria advertised on the ingredients list. It should be on the supplement website – if not, email and ask about it, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Look for a mark of regulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, look for products registered with the Food Standard Agency, says Ludlam-Raine, or the very few registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another worthwhile thing to look at is whether it has an Informed Sport logo, which assures professional athletes that the product is regularly tested for banned substances as well as meeting top-quality standards, says Dr Ogunkoya, who also works with an app called SafeSupp which allows consumers to scan supplement labels to assess the quality of their ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Also look for:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Absorption-enhancing combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vitamins and minerals enhance each other, while others reduce absorption, says Ludlam-Raine. So good combined products to look for include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and calcium (vitamin D aids calcium absorption); vitamin C and iron (vitamin C boosts iron absorption, especially if the iron is from a plant-based source); and magnesium and vitamin D (magnesium helps activate vitamin D in the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Money-back guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll find trustworthy brands stand behind their products,” says Dr Ogunkoya. “They don’t want to lose money, so offering a guarantee on a supplement should show they are confident it will be effective, and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as a huge variety of supplements on the market, there is an ever-widening and increasingly inventive array of forms they come in. Whether you prefer to take them as pills, capsules, sprays, or gummies – all can be effective, but some are better absorbed than others, says Ludlam-Raine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprays are good for vitamin D (absorbed via the mouth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gummies may contain added sugars and fewer active ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capsules can be easier to swallow than tablets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patches and skin creams are generally less reliable for nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Avoid ‘megadoses’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have too much of a good thing.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Some vitamins (A, D, E, K) are fat-soluble and can build up in the body, leading to toxicity,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Excess iron should also be avoided unless prescribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Watch out for proprietary blends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are combined supplements where the exact nutrient amounts aren’t listed. It’s a bit like KFC’s secret blend of herbs and spices, but what the colonel does to stop competitors copying his flavour may, when it comes to supplements, be done to ‘hide’ what’s actually in the supplement and use cheaper ingredients and less beneficial doses, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Poor bioavailability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some cheap brands use forms of vitamins that aren’t well absorbed, because it costs less,” says Ludlam-Raine. See vitamin D, above. Or in the case of calcium: “Calcium citrate is better absorbed than calcium carbonate by approximately 22 to 27 per cent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Combinations that cancel each other out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/best-foods-iron-levels/"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and calcium. Calcium blocks iron absorption, so take them separately at different times, says Ludlam-Raine. ‘If taking multiple supplements, space them out throughout the day to increase absorption or check with a healthcare professional.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Avoid ‘filler’ ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are often found in cheaper supplements to pad out to mix. Examples include maltodextrin, a type of artificial sugar, and guar gum, a thickening agent made from guar beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fillers are added to supplements to help with stability, absorption, or to bulk out the tablet. In general, small amounts of additives are not harmful to health in the context of a healthy diet,’ says Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they don’t add anything beneficial – and in some cases, taken in excess, can cause side effects, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you recognise a filler? Look out for names such as magnesium stearate (a salt which in high amounts can have laxative effects and impact nutrient absorption), silicon dioxide (a compound of silicon and oxygen, little crystals of which are used as an anti-caking agent), maltodextrin (a binder and artificial sugar which can have a negative influence on the gut microbiome), guar gum (a thickener made from gel-forming fibres within guar beans) and more.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, recent studies show that major shifts like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39797935/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to a Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.26804" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047847/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slashing stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slashing stress&lt;/a&gt; are all excellent ways to boost cognitive health. In addition to these great options, &lt;strong&gt;there's another simple trick to protect your brain: move your body for just five minutes a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;strong&gt;as little as 35 minutes total of exercise per week can reduce the chance of dementia over a subsequent four-year timespan by an amazing 41%.&lt;/strong&gt; Even people who aren’t used to any physical exertion at all can gain this benefit with a small amount of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that the more exercise you do, the more your dementia risk drops. For example, out of the 90,000 adults from the United Kingdom who participated in the study, those who did 25 to 60 minutes of exercise a week saw a 60% reduction in risk. The participants who did 70 to 130.9 minutes of exercise a week achieved a 63% lower risk and those who did 140 minutes or more of exercise in seven days accomplished a 69% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, doing more is better, but the point of the study was to show that any extra movement counts,” says the study's lead author &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,&lt;/a&gt; assistant professor of epidemiology in the Bloomberg School’s department of epidemiology with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, nearly 7 million adults in the US have dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=An%20estimated%206.9%20million%20Americans,prevent%20or%20cure%20Alzheimer's%20disease." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Alzheimer’s Association reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the Alzheimer’s Association reports&lt;/a&gt;. About 1 in 9 Americans age 65 and older are affected by the disease, but that number jumps to 7 in 10 for those age 75 and older. This new study holds important news for anyone trying to avoid a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's more information to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fdementia%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20352013&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa64076250%2Fstudy-exercise-lower-dementia-risk%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of dementia can interfere with critical daily activities like thinking ability, memory and social relationships.

Exercise also &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1502417/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improves blood flow to the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improves blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, “there is other published evidence showing that exercise is associated with &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain-physiology/what-neurogenesis#:~:text=Neurogenesis%20is%20the%20process%20by,birth%20and%20throughout%20our%20lifespan." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurogenesis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain volume,” says Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of activity works to cut your dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: whatever activity you enjoy that raises your heart rate will do the trick. “Our findings suggest anything counts!” says Wanigatunga. “The way we measured moderate to vigorous physical activity was through a wrist-worn electronic monitor that captures all activity types — not just structured exercise. Therefore, the results suggest &lt;strong&gt;any extra movement – which can also include structured exercise – beyond one's usual daily routine that is at a moderate intensity or higher could be beneficial to reduce dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you can fit in your daily movement in short bursts – taking the stairs instead of the elevator, briskly walking the dog, you name it. In the most recent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published in 2018), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week — an average of a little more than 20 minutes a day. However, this can be tough for some people to manage. “The point of the study was to show any extra movement counts,” assures Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can physical activity benefit your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help you think better, remember more, have an easier time solving problems and achieve emotional balance, which can help with depression and anxiety, according to information &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20can%20help%20you,of%20cognitive%20decline%2C%20including%20dementia." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published by the CDC on January 31, 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published by the CDC on January 31, 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, physical activity also improves the brain functions that affect your hearing. “The brain does not just receive sound; it actively interprets and organizes it, allowing us to focus on conversations, filter out background noise and make sense of complex sounds,” says &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/physician/1052/daniel-daneshvar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of sports concussion at &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and chief of the division of brain injury at &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Spaulding Rehabilitation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Spaulding Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; in Boston and assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty significant, because if you develop hearing trouble between the ages of 40 and 65, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/new-study-links-hearing-loss-with-dementia-in-older-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; your dementia risk increases. “As we age, changes in brain health can make it harder to process what we hear, even if our ears are still working well,” explains Dr. Daneshvar. &lt;strong&gt;“Regular exercise supports brain function by improving blood flow, strengthening neural connections and reducing inflammation, all of which help maintain cognitive abilities.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that staying physically active may not only protect hearing, but also help preserve the ability to understand speech in noisy environments, react quickly to sounds, and stay engaged in conversations, which are all important for long-term cognitive and social well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working more physical activity in your life can pay off for your brain now and later. “Move as much as possible throughout the day, and add regular exercise sessions for even stronger protection,” Dr. Danesgvar suggests. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anatomy-of-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your brain isn’t a muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your brain isn’t a muscle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly impossible to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a42790639/what-are-ultra-processed-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, given that they make up &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-024-01095-7.epdf&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fhealthy-eating%2Fa64074545%2Fhow-to-stop-eating-ultra-processed-foods-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:70 percent;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of our food supply in America. But these foods have been &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to serious health problems, from type 2 diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20065762/obesity-metabolic-syndrome-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a61766184/vegan-diet-may-reduce-biological-age-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:faster biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;faster biological aging&lt;/a&gt;, so it might be smart to start reassessing your relationship with some of these products. Plus, cutting back on your ultra-processed food intake could help some folks reach a healthier weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scaling back on all-things ultra-processed is easier said than done, a new scientific study just found that there's actually a pretty simple trick that can help you avoid these foods that works in just eight weeks. Doctors are calling the intervention “effective” and “smart.” Here’s what it involves, plus why it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obesity Science and Practice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Obesity Science and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed 14 adults with obesity or overweight who usually ate at least two ultra-processed foods a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants follow an eight-week plan that involved weekly educational group sessions and individual meal planning sessions. Those sessions also included information on how to identify ultra-processed foods, why they can be harmful, and strategies for dealing with cravings (which can sometimes occur when cutting back on ultra-processed foods). The participants received financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card, too—all with the goal of helping them identify ultra-processed foods and consume less of them in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants complete questionnaires on their diets at the start of the study and again at the end, and they found that participants reduced their ultra-processed foods intake by nearly half. This also led to a reduction in caloric intake from these foods by nearly 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the participants consumed 612 less calories a day, 37 percent less sodium, and 50 percent less sugar. (They didn’t make any big changes to how much fruits or vegetables they ate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big stat to keep in mind: The participants lost an average of 7.7 pounds during the eight-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the program so successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have a few theories. Instead of just telling people to "eat healthier," this educational method "provides structured support to navigate a food environment where ultra-processed foods dominate,” says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix of education, personalized meal planning, financial assistance, and advice on coping with cravings is a solid combination, Yang says. “In essence, when individuals are equipped with knowledge, practical tools, and support, they are more likely to make sustainable dietary changes,” he says. “It turns out that when ultra-processed foods stop competing for attention, nutrient-dense foods can take center stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weight-loss front, ultra-processed foods tend to be high in calories and are really tasty, making them tough to resist, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “They encourage overeating and weight gain,” she adds. As a result, it just makes sense that people would lose weight when they cut back on how much of these foods they have, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I apply these findings to my own life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, educating yourself about processed foods doesn't always require spending boatloads of cash. Just make sure you stick to vetted sources that rely on trained medical experts. &lt;em&gt;Women's Health &lt;/em&gt;also has its own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods guide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods guide&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down the big points, if you're looking for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to drill down a little more, researchers from Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital just released a website called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.truefood.tech/__;!!Ivohdkk!nft9loFpT2vkoAso3_kZS0uwva7vdEqWGRic1LHaEPWgvVlKKy1g9622R42IWpY7U9hGp7K0U4zW7qKQYtWESQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TrueFood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TrueFood&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to search for the level of processing involved in products sold at popular grocery chains. If you're still having a tough time weeding out ultra-processed foods from their less-processed counterparts, it might be worth having a chat with a registered dietitian, if your budget allows for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes food ultra-processed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All foods are classified by something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA scale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;, which puts foods into four different categories that denote different levels of processing based on certain features. Here’s a breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods &lt;/strong&gt;are in their natural state or are barely altered. That includes foods like fresh produce and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; are products made through minimal processing, including pressing, grinding, refining, or milling. Olive oil and almond flour fall into this camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are changed from their natural state. They usually have things like sugar, oil, salt, or other ingredients added. Bagged frozen vegetables and canned fish fall are considered processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are processed, with additional ingredients like artificial colors, flavors, additives, and preservatives to add texture and extend the products’ shelf life. These foods are usually packaged, and include things like potato chips, sweetened cereals, and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to know at first glance which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't. But often, these foods come in a package (instead of say, sitting in the fresh air in the produce aisle). Beyond that, some of the biggest ultra-processed foods include things like sausages, deli meats, salty snacks, packaged cookies, and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is ultra-processed food bad for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of media coverage of the harms of consuming a ton of ultra-processed foods lately. Dr. Kim points out that they have been “linked to serious health risks.” Those &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you should also know that these foods are generally not very nutritious and contain higher levels of simple carbohydrates and sugars, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. That can crowd out more nutritious foods and raise the risk of weight gain, he says. “Carbohydrates and sugars are what we advise that our patients &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; to help them lose weight,” Dr. Ali adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much ultra-processed food is safe to consume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no scientifically established consumption limit for these foods at the moment, Yang says. But “research consistently suggests that limiting ultra-processed food intake is beneficial for overall health,” he adds. Said another way: Less is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Dr. Kim recommends focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and nuts, over ultra-processed foods. Dr. Ali also suggests trying to fill your plate with protein sources and vegetables first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you. Take, unsweetened almond milk. It's an ultra-processed food, but Dr. Ali says it can be a good cow’s milk substitute for people who are sensitive to dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Yang just recommends doing your best to learn more about ultra-processed foods, and limit how much of them you have. “A reasonable goal would be to shift toward a diet where whole or minimally-processed foods are the foundation, with ultra-processed foods as the occasional indulgence rather than a dietary staple,” he says. “Much like screen time or dessert, moderation is key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9kTGJHdVdXX0tpOTZaYTQ0WWVORmJGVFFaSUlRblJQektTcktKdW1YNU5vZzNpRHhVbGlrdnJMTVpKXzRJMkxQcjlBUGtDMi1MWW9hTGhSVDVsY3M4Sk5Oc1B2WHMydEtqWkpIS2haRUJ6Zw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Have Discovered Shocking Amounts of Microplastics in the Brain – And It Could Be Increasing Our Risk of Dementia - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:17:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA</guid></item><item><title>Doctor explains signs to watch for to detect colon cancer early - 10TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxPZ2VzZzJ2anZJRnp6SG9FV0tKT29tR2lpR0hwTnBLbUZxakR4OUlrTG1PZjcyRkROT2xhMzJMeFNrZGdnR05jTmViV21Tc3BiTVVqYmVuMFZGUVVxRnJ2VXozVWQtaVhHOGd6TW42N09FemNlRElZUnJCS3BfV3htSW90R3ZLM2luckNMQkk0YnRDMy1kaks2ay1lNm90M3JUaW1FYzE0Q21sdnA2TjhzMmhvZFBITDVST3R3Sk1KR01oeEw2TzRUYQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;About 50 million Americans over the age of 45 are not up to date with colon cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — Colorectal cancer is one of the most treatable forms of cancer when caught early with a 90% survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a third of all Americans over the age of 45 are not up to date with screenings, which totals to 50 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10TV’s Bryn Caswell sat down with Dr. Samuel Akinyeye to discuss the basics of what you need to know to stay on top of your colon health. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akinyeye suggests getting to know your family's medical history because early treatment can save your life or the life of someone you love. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend colonoscopies starting at 45 years old. In 2024, the National Cancer Institute estimated over 150,000 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer, and over 53,000 died from it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
