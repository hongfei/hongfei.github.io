The morning meeting is in full swing but thanks to a late night out your brain switches off at the precise moment a question comes your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such momentary lapses in attention are a common problem for the sleep deprived, but what happens in the brain in these spells of mental shutdown has proved hard to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now scientists have shed light on the process and found there is more to zoning out than meets the eye. The brief loss of focus coincides with a wave of fluid flowing out of the brain, which returns once attention recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The moment somebody’s attention fails is the moment this wave of fluid starts to pulse,” said Dr Laura Lewis, a senior author on the study at MIT in Boston. “It’s not just that your neurons aren’t paying attention to the world, there’s this big change in fluid in the brain at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lewis and her colleague Dr Zinong Yang investigated the sleep-deprived brain to understand the kinds of attention failures that lead drowsy drivers to crash and tired animals to become a predator’s lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the study, 26 volunteers took turns to wear an EEG cap while lying in an fMRI scanner. This enabled the scientists to monitor the brain’s electrical activity and physiological changes during tests in which people had to respond as quickly as possible to hearing a tone or seeing crosshairs on a screen turn into a square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each volunteer was scanned after a restful night’s sleep at home and after a night of total sleep deprivation supervised by scientists at the laboratory. Unsurprisingly, people performed far worse when sleep deprived, responding more slowly or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lapses in attention came with striking changes. Scans revealed a wave of cerebrospinal fluid being expelled from the brain moments after attention dropped and returning a second or so after the lapse ended. Such waves are normally seen in deep sleep and are thought to help the brain flush out metabolic waste that builds up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other measurements showed that the pupils of people’s eyes constricted about 12 seconds before the fluid left the brain and returned to normal after the lapse. Breathing and heart rate also fell, the researchers report in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02098-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While more questions remain, the lapses seem to happen when the brain tries to juggle normal cognitive functioning with essential maintenance that is normally carried out during sleep. “It’s your brain trying to take a break,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bill Wisden, the director of the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/dementia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; Research Institute at Imperial College London, said the work highlighted the profound changes sleep deprivation could have on the brain. “It is not clear if these changes in brain fluid flow with sleep deprivation are good and protective in some way or bad and pathological,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Ria Kodosaki, a neuroscientist at UCL, said the changes seemed to be “structured, biological events that look a lot like the onset of sleep, and the lapses in attention are not passive but organised to essentially give the brain a small rest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said: “Paradoxical as it may be, these dangerous lapses may be the brain’s way of protecting itself. Think of them as forced pit stops: the brain temporarily drops its external focus to perform essential housekeeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 11:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPWFZYc1BRalJFSzRDVlpJa0xUbDdtZldHd0JCRm96d1Q4aHhFeGZ2VXBDNEFzZnNDQnlMVmJGMkxKeWlLaU5PVG5JZF9TWUEyUnlzczMtMWRUaUxGSE9hWTVXSUZWRm9WVGdUNDV0QjNKODBUeVdETzRzaWJiZ3RhT0Y4MEY4RXlZUE83SnpCa3VRbVh2QmdiTlFQQ09DcnVndHREMA</guid></item><item><title>老年痴呆症药丸似乎可以保护高风险人群中的一些人：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5575561/alzheimers-pill-apoe4-high-risk-lecanemab-donanemab</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Scientists are taking a second look at a drug for Alzheimer's that may help patients who are particularly at risk of developing the disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In April, the future was looking bleak for an experimental Alzheimer's drug called valiltramiprosate, or ALZ-801.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers had just released &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/topline-results-from-pivotal-apolloe4-phase-3-trial-of-oral-valiltramiprosate-alz-801-in-patients-with-early-alzheimers-disease-carrying-two-copies-of-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topline results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of a study of more than 300 people age 50 or older, who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's. Overall, those who got the drug did no better than those given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But in September, a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40265-025-02250-5" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;closer look&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the results revealed benefits for a subgroup of 125 people who had only mild memory problems when they started taking the drug. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those participants, initially diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment rather than mild dementia, "showed very meaningful responses," says Dr. Susan Abushakra, chief medical officer of Alzheon, the drug's maker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. That result appears comparable with benefits from the two Alzheimer's drugs now on the market: &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/06/1186225580/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-gets-full-fda-approval-medicare-coverage-lecanemab" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lecanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donabemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But the true effect of ALZ-801 is hard to quantify because of the relatively small number of participants in the group with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;More robust results came from measures of brain atrophy — the shrinkage that tends to come with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the hippocampus, for example, participants who got ALZ-801 experienced about 18% less atrophy than those who got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's an important difference, Abushakra says, because the hippocampus is critical to memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Drugs&lt;/em&gt;. The study was supported by a $47 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A drug that's different&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, results like that would probably fall short of the evidence required for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But ALZ-801 may get special consideration because it has potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those drugs are both monoclonal antibodies given by intravenous infusions. That adds to the cost and requires patients to make multiple trips to an infusion center.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;ALZ-801 is a twice-daily pill that can be taken at home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also, the monoclonal antibodies work primarily by breaking down sticky amyloid plaques. These plaques form after fragments of a misfolded protein called beta-amyloid begin to clump together.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Alzheon's product is meant to keep plaques from forming in the first place, by preventing amyloid proteins from clumping at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, ALZ-801 doesn't cause the swelling or bleeding in the brain that often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A safer treatment for a high-risk group&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The availability of a safer drug like ALZ-801 could be a boon to people who carry two copies of a gene called APOE4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Their genetic status means they have about 10 times the usual risk of developing Alzheimer's. As a result, even though APOE4/4 carriers make up only about 2% of the population, they represent about 15% of all people diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, people with APOE4 genes are not only more vulnerable to Alzheimer's, they are also more likely to experience side effects from treatment with monoclonal antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These individuals are at higher risk for inflammation in the brain that can be quite serious," says &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/research/about-banner-research/research-leadership/jessica-langbaum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Langbaum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher at Banner Health in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Langbaum thinks people with the APOE4/4 genes can be treated safely with the current monoclonal antibodies. That could mean starting with a lower dose, she says, or beginning treatment earlier in the disease, when fewer amyloid plaques are present.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.researchalz.com/alzheimers-treatment-center-staff/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Watson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist who carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, thinks people like him need a safer drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watson, a co-author of the new study, also notes that ALZ may have benefits beyond those seen with monoclonal antibodies. For example, he says, the experimental drug appears better at reducing levels of a protein fragment associated with brain cell death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is coming from people who have kept taking ALZ-801 after the initial 18-month study period ended, Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite carrying genes that usually lead to a swift decline, he says, "many of them are holding their own" in their 60s and 70s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2awux003i26qn0iya30vl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 infections have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/health/covid-heart-attack-stroke-risk"&gt;strongly linked&lt;/a&gt; with cardiovascular conditions&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like heart disease and stroke, but new research shows that other viral infections such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis C and shingles can also increase the risk of heart problems and cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2fyva00073b6n6r8xyps7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, reviewed 155 studies spanning decades and found that viral infections can raise the risk of heart disease both immediately after an infection and over the long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3lnbu00013b6qtgkedowu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who caught the flu were up to six times more likely to have a heart attack in the month after the infection, and those who had Covid-19 had nearly twice the risk of developing heart disease or stroke compared with people who hadn’t been infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gy74000r3b6nt3p9xq6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One way to prevent this is really vaccination,” said lead study author Dr. Kosuke Kawai, an adjunct professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Often, we get vaccinated to reduce the risk of influenza or other illness, but I think vaccines can provide additional benefit in terms of potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2bgpp00003b6nbgc5nw9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors of the new research concluded that influenza and Covid-19 infections were associated with higher risk of acute cardiovascular events such as heart attacks. Chronic viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C and shingles were associated with a long-­term increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2g5rs000d3b6nuh2aaodm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study also notes that cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and chikungunya have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but it says more research on the association is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2g52n000b3b6n4m5cpp65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings fit with what clinicians have long observed, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000k3b6neoabuvui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, many infections can do this,” he said. “Respiratory viruses increase cardiovascular risk in two ways”: indirectly, by triggering an overactive immune response that causes inflammation, leading to stress and blood clotting that affects the heart; or directly, when the virus can attack heart tissue itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000l3b6n1993db0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, flu and RSV, act through the indirect pathway, Roberts said, while enterovirus strains – related to the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease – can directly infect the heart muscle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000m3b6n7endmkwn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generally, the more severe the viral illness, the greater the risk of cardiovascular complications,” he said. These infections can also worsen existing heart problems like heart failure, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3h08o00103b6ntwxbu4wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kawai said it’s hard to quantify how likely it is for someone with a viral infection to develop cardiovascular disease, so everyone should take protective measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3hf4600173b6nzwv0fqzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It also depends on the viral infection,” Kawai said. “It’s not just the patients who have underlying increased risk for cardiovascular disease that might be at greater risk, but those who are younger adults, or people who might not necessarily have some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are also at increased risk” after a viral infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gg10000i3b6nbf3kstxc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease]. Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2h2gv000t3b6nk705rlto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They concluded that preventive measures such as vaccination and timely antiviral treatment could help reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, which remains the world’s leading cause of death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2h2gv000u3b6nz82k8p0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines for many of these viruses exist and generally lessen the risk of cardiovascular events after infection, since the severe infection is more likely to be mild in a vaccinated individual,” Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb5v78h00003b6n5kq2k5g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who have a healthy immune system, vaccines are protective without causing cardiovascular disease because they typically contain a small amount of an inactivated virus or specific subunits from the pathogen, Kawai said. The inactivated virus does not trigger an overactive immune response that causes inflammation that affects the heart, nor is it able to attack heart tissues themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A sedentary lifestyle will increase your risk of chronic health problems, age your brain and body, and make you vulnerable to depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Movement, not exercise, is the daily answer to avoiding a sedentary lifestyle. This can be as simple as walking up the steps at work rather than taking the elevator. Anything that provides us a chance to get our heart rate up is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we’ve heard a lot about getting to 10,000 steps a day—which can certainly be a great goal for some people—recent work suggests 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve our health. Many people may find that working towards this many steps is less daunting and a more realistic goal than 10,000. On average, this is about 4.5-5.3 kilometers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h4mBXncRukqiSvgcrtZEeL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h4mBXncRukqiSvgcrtZEeL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackett says regular physical activity can improve heart health, reduce or slow cognitive decline and avoid metabolic syndrome—a range of conditions that, combined, increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And walking can be particularly beneficial he says, adding: “A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of close to 85,000 people found that walking, particularly brisk walking, reduces all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-two-be-socially-active" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-two-be-socially-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step two: Be socially active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0c8836d3-7266-4810-85c9-ab0d0962b370"&gt;“Maintaining close personal relationships with our family and friends is an often overlooked aspect of our health,” says Hackett. “But an influential &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39279411/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39279411/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Julianne Holt-Lunstad found social connections were as important for our health as quitting smoking, and more critical than our weight and not exercising enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining these connections gives us the opportunity to check in on others, share our experiences and offer mutual support. But this does not mean you have to be with people only in person—there are lots of ways to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technological advances allow us to maintain consistent connections with close others. We can engage with others on social media—although at times this can certainly impact us negatively—or send our significant other a quick text to let them know we are thinking about them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joining and being active in community groups can be another important way to be engaged socially. These groups allow us to pursue activities important to us and connect us with like-minded others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-three-use-mindfulness-as-a-stress-buster" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-three-use-mindfulness-as-a-stress-buster"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step three: Use mindfulness as a stress buster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="39db5fd0-42c2-4b12-bfae-96e46065ccb4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Justin Hackett says a few mindful breaths can help invoke our body’s natural relaxation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / andreswd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="8d88ca0e-8f31-42db-b0ec-168d65365519"&gt;“Balancing the demands of family, work and school can make it hard to escape stress, but science shows a mindful approach is quite effective at managing it,” says Hackett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mindfulness does not need to be complicated. Taking a break from work and stretching at our desk, or if possible, taking a quick walk outside can make us feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, simply taking a few mindful breaths—inhaling slowly through our nose and gently exhaling through our mouth—can help invoke our body’s natural relaxation process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-four-be-kind-to-yourself-and-others" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-four-be-kind-to-yourself-and-others"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step four: Be kind to yourself and others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a3bff539-98bd-4b16-8200-74fe67ad7bd1"&gt;Hackett recommends trying a loving-kindness meditation. Spending just a few minutes a day repeating phrases such as “may I be happy” has been shown to increase positive emotions and help manage depressive feelings, according to a study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.21832" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.21832" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Traumatic Stress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Practicing kindness can make us feel better,” says Hackett. “Sending a colleague a thank you note, or even simply holding a door for someone can have a positive impact. You never know what other people are dealing with or working through. A simple act like holding a door for someone and smiling at them can mean more to them than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way to promote wellbeing is to focus on the good things in our lives. It’s easy to allow negative events in our lives to consume us and bring us down. But appreciating positive moments in our lives makes us feel good and helps alleviate stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-five-prioritize-quality-sleep" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-five-prioritize-quality-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step five: Prioritize quality sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3db14a6b-6fc0-4c48-b59c-e87558de10b2"&gt;“When people get busier, overcommitted, more sedentary or even depressed, one of the first things that suffers is sleep quality and/or quantity,” says Henney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But even moderate improvements in sleep can lead to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101556" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101556" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;better mental health and emotional stability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;improved memory&lt;/a&gt;, while consistently bad sleep is associated with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13573" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13573" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;brain fog and cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, particularly as we age, according to a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Modifications to a type of immune cell programmed to recognize and kill cancerous tumors could make them even more effective assassins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School have found a novel way to engineer chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR-NK"&gt;CAR-NK&lt;/a&gt;) cells to ensure they're not rejected by the body's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-immune-system-weighs-the-same-as-a-pineapple-study-finds"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; as foes rather than friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the treatment is yet to be tested in humans, initial experiments in mice and human tissues in the lab suggest these new CAR-NK cells are well tolerated and effective at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-fungus-can-kill-cancer-cells-and-we-finally-know-its-secret"&gt;fighting cancer&lt;/a&gt; – a promising start for these next-gen upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-blocks-multiple-tumors-in-mice-for-250-days"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Blocks Multiple Tumors in Mice For 250 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural killer cells are produced in the body as a first-line defense against cancers or tissues infected with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="178689" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;. They don't need priming, reacting to suspect cells that don't seem to belong. By engineering chimeric antigen receptors onto NK cells taken from a patient's own blood, the tiny killers can better target specific proteins known to identify cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of engineering enough CAR-NK cells to return to a patient takes several weeks, prompting scientists to consider using blood from healthy donors instead. While it means an army of CAR-NK cells can be ready to go at all times, the process increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-test-predicts-whether-organ-transplants-will-be-rejected"&gt;immune system rejection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors.jpg" alt="Tumor progress in mice" class="wp-image-178692 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors-600x299.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The engineered cells had a noticeable impact on tumors in mice (shown by the bright blotches).

The enhanced versions lasted at least three weeks, whereas the standard CAR-NK and NK cells were rejected by the immune systems of the mice, leaving the cancer to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was another benefit of the upgraded CAR-NK cells: a reduced likelihood of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22700-cytokine-release-syndrome"&gt;cytokine release syndrome&lt;/a&gt; – a potentially fatal side effect where the immune system triggers severe inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team thinks their approach may also improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immune-response-thought-to-aid-cancer-could-be-an-unexpected-cure"&gt;CAR-T cell therapies&lt;/a&gt;, which use 'T' immune cells instead of natural killer cells.

			&lt;p&gt;Creative experience might enhance brain health, which could slow down the brain's ageing. That's according to a study by a group of international scientists across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that creative activities, like dance classes – the tango proved particularly effective – or art classes or music lessons or a hobby like gaming, had a positive impact on an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="179325" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) "brain clock".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the more the participant practised their art form, the "younger" their brain clocks were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;'Superager' Brains Defy Cognitive Decline.

They compare neuroimaging, electrophysiological, or neuromolecular data to normal brain patterns across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, by using a brain clock we can try to understand what makes a brain more resilient and what ages it faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you want to find out?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know whether being creative isn't just fun or emotionally rewarding, but actually biologically good for the brain. There's growing &lt;a href="https://www.artsandhealth.ie/research-evaluation/who-report-what-is-the-evidence-on-the-role-of-the-arts-in-improving-health-and-well-being-a-scoping-review/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that arts engagement supports wellbeing, but we still lack a solid understanding of how creativity might shape brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09548963.2021.1910492"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that art is too mysterious and intangible to study scientifically or to make a biological difference. We wanted to challenge both ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could creative experiences, something that feels joyful and deeply human, also be measured in the brain? Could they help delay brain ageing in the same way that physical exercise helps the body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study tested whether creativity might influence the brain clock. If your brain clock says you're younger than your real age, it means your brain is functioning more efficiently than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did you go about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collected data from almost 1,400 people across different countries. Some were expert tango dancers, musicians, visual artists or gamers. Others were non-experts matched for age, education and gender from the same countries. Non-experts had no previous experience in the different disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recorded their brain activity using techniques called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17218-magnetoencephalography-meg"&gt;magnetoencephalography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sapienlabs.org/lab-talk/what-does-the-eeg-signal-measure/"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt;. They can be used to measure brain activity in real time. Then we trained computer models (machine learning models) to create a brain clock for each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models can be trained in less than an hour. The challenge was to collect the data – from Argentina to Poland – of hundreds of participants. That would be impossible without the collaboration of many researchers and institutes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we used the brain clocks to predict each person's age from their data. If someone's predicted brain age was lower than their real age, it meant their brain was ageing more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we used something called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/biophysical-models"&gt;biophysical modelling&lt;/a&gt;. These models are "digital brains", and we used these virtual brains to understand the biology behind creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the machine learning models (the "brain clocks") is, although they can learn patterns in the data to make predictions, they can't reproduce real brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biophysical models, on the other hand, are "real" brains in a digital world, that is, they are a mirrored copy of the brain inside a computer. These models use detailed biological and physical rules to simulate how a brain works. So, they aren't AI models. They're "generative models" that can, in fact, generate brain activity from mathematical equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While brain clocks can be used to measure brain health (accelerated or delayed brain ageing), the biophysical models can explain why creativity is associated with better brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you find out?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across every creative field, the pattern was strikingly consistent: creativity was linked to a younger-looking brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tango dancers showed brains that appeared more than seven years younger than their chronological age. Musicians and visual artists had brains about five to six years younger. Gamers, about four years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179334" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642.jpg" alt="man playing computer games" class="wp-image-179334 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179334" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gamers had brains four years younger, on average. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEP5HyXB1c/"&gt;RyanKing999/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also ran a smaller experiment where non-experts trained for just 30 hours in the strategy video game &lt;a href="https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt; to see whether short-term creative learning could have similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the short-term experiment, after only 30 hours of creative training, participants' brain clocks ticked backward, showing a reduction of brain age between two and three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more people practised their art, the stronger the effect. And it didn't matter what kind of art it was. It could be dancing, painting, music, or gaming. All helped key brain areas work better together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas, important for focus and learning, usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03209-x"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00502-7"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;, but creativity seems to keep their connections stronger and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity, we found, protects brain areas that are vulnerable to ageing and makes brain communication more efficient (similar to building more, larger, and higher-quality roads to communicate between cities within a country).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arts and sciences, often seen as opposites, are in fact allies. Creativity shapes not only culture but biology. Our study reframes creativity as a biological pathway to brain health and resilience, not only a cultural or psychological phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that artistic engagement can delay brain ageing, this research helps us reimagine the role of creativity in education, public health, and ageing societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the big picture, it expands our understanding of healthy ageing beyond disease prevention. It highlights creativity as a scalable, accessible and deeply human mechanism to sustain cognitive and emotional wellbeing across diverse populations and lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're wondering whether being creative is "good for you", the answer seems to be "yes". Scientifically, measurably, and beautifully so. Your next dance step, brush stroke, or musical note might just help your brain stay a little younger.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267797/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Whether supporting muscle and nerve function, or strengthening bones and aiding energy production, our bodies rely on magnesium every day. And despite this, many people don’t get nearly enough of it. Why? Because many of us aren’t even aware of the natural sources of magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health, magnesium is “widely distributed in plant and animal foods,” but refining and processing of foods often strips it away. That’s why, in everyday diets, especially ones that rely heavily on processed and refined products, it’s surprisingly easy to fall short of your magnesium needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often when we think of magnesium-rich foods, we might picture familiar items like spinach, almonds, or whole grains. But there are plenty of less obvious, natural sources hiding in our regular diet — foods you perhaps never considered. Discovering these surprising options can not only make boosting magnesium intake easier, but it also makes it tastier and more varied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll explore 10 surprising natural sources of magnesium — foods you may not have realized contribute significantly — and we’ll learn how to consume them to maximize absorption and benefit your health. Whether you’re a vegetarian, omnivore, busy professional, or just someone who wants to boost their mineral intake without relying on supplements, these food-based options offer real, practical ways to help meet your magnesium needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 01:48:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPVXV4YzFSS2szX29IdVFxTlVqUmc0cWpreFQ0SnZZcEZodDRKV19FUk9TYm5CVHppLW1EZEtaYXpoUzZkaUl2QkZrZC1ER3RGTDdDMk9OREpYbHMzV1FpSk0zR29ZNjhfbG1rS2Z6VnF1bGh1Y3B2c2lkNlk5NTBzMzJrLWkwdndld2NrQ2wyRDR2NE04d1RWdTNtOG5ndjlLRF9LYlpJeXN1MkJodmxNQ1NQQnhlOFc0LV9IRzN5MzNScUE3ZVYtNmVZR1pkWTYzenUtT0dSV29icmVkYjNyVU15aGpXRVpWem00X2JFWFd4NHRwTkpQVmV3Um_SAYQCQVVfeXFMUDZycXlhMmRUQjNPNVNuWVFtWDdJVWtRTHVaYzB4STZGd19oWjA4NWVmWW1RZ3FwWjVCSGhSRDVUVURRNkRQSGVQeS1OX21EZVJwT1p4YnQ2Y1hzT2hEWDJmVXMzNkEtT2RWaHcxdUdHOFl5OFkxNUF6c0tiS2NKTUhWMk9jeVZiaHpRQTJkNVFiMFBJQ3hlY28wX203eWloeTFuZ1FnRjcxdkd2R3pueFRWSWFvMk1YWGtxS2hKbENFSVFyeTRaRGxmUmczQjIzN2prU3M2NnZJSUViaFlWTEtwUGd1Qk56TWt4NVZYUjdFaW1TbmhhcmNOVHVqYzg5RjlyTkI</guid></item><item><title>这些医生希望打破医学上的羞耻和指责的循环- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5589220/shame-competence-medicine-doctors-blame-patients</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The distress that Will Bynum later recognized as shame settled over him nearly immediately.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bynum, then in his second year of residency training as a family medicine physician, was wrapping up a long shift when he was called into an emergency delivery. To save the baby's life, he used a vacuum device, which applies suction to assist with rapid delivery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The baby emerged unharmed. But the mother suffered a severe vaginal tear that required surgical repair by an obstetrician. Soon afterward, Bynum retreated to an empty hospital room, trying to process his feelings about the unexpected complication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't want to see anybody. I didn't want anybody to find me," said Bynum, now an&lt;a href="https://fmch.duke.edu/personnel/will-bynum-md" target="_blank"&gt; associate professor of family medicine&lt;/a&gt; at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina. "It was a really primitive response."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Shame is a common and highly uncomfortable human emotion. In the years since, Bynum has become a&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2025/07000/how_shame_shaped_me__exploring_the_impact_of_shame.17.aspx" target="_blank"&gt; leading voice&lt;/a&gt; among clinicians and researchers who argue that the intense crucible of medical training can amplify shame in future doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He is now part of an emerging effort to teach what he describes as "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02269-4/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;shame competence&lt;/a&gt;" to medical school students and practicing physicians. While shame can't be eliminated, Bynum and his research colleagues maintain that related skills and practices can reduce the culture of shame and foster a healthier way to engage with it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without this approach, they argue, tomorrow's doctors won't recognize and address the emotion in themselves and others. And thus, they risk transmitting it to their patients, even inadvertently, which may&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7613638/pdf/JEP-28-854.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; worsen their health&lt;/a&gt;. Shaming patients can backfire, Bynum said, making them defensive and leading to isolation and sometimes substance use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Blame the patients&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. political environment presents an additional obstacle to changing the culture of shame. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top Trump administration health officials have&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/maha-movement-chronically-ill-blame-game/" target="_blank"&gt; publicly blamed&lt;/a&gt; autism, diabetes, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other chronic issues in large part on the lifestyle choices of people with the conditions — or their parents.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For instance, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested in a Fox News interview that more diabetes could be treated with cooking classes instead of "&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/" target="_blank"&gt;just throwing insulin at people&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even before the political shift, that attitude was reflected at doctors' offices as well. A 2023 study found that&lt;a href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(23)00590-9/abstract" target="_blank"&gt; one-third of physicians reported feeling repulsed&lt;/a&gt; when treating patients with Type 2 diabetes, which is sometimes linked to obesity. About 44% viewed those patients as lacking motivation to make lifestyle changes, while 39% said they tended to be lazy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't like feeling shame. We want to avoid it. It's very uncomfortable," said&lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/9cc3f9cc/" target="_blank"&gt; Michael Jaeb&lt;/a&gt;, a nurse at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500241/" target="_blank"&gt; conducted a review&lt;/a&gt; of related studies, published in 2024. And if the source of shame is from the clinician, the patient may ask, "'Why would I go back?' In some cases, that patient may generalize that to the whole health care system."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indeed, some patients, like Christa Reed have avoided doctors because of this. Reed dropped out of regular medical care for two decades, weary of weight-related lectures. "I was told when I was pregnant that my morning sickness was because I was a plus-size, overweight woman," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Except for a few urgent medical issues, such as an infected cut, Reed avoided health care providers. "Because going into a doctor for an annual visit would be pointless," said the now 45-year-old Minneapolis-area wedding photographer. "They would only just tell me to lose weight."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, last year, severe jaw pain drove Reed to seek specialty care. A routine blood pressure check showed a sky-high reading, sending her to the emergency room. "They said, 'We don't know how you're walking around normal,'" she recounted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Reed has found supportive physicians with expertise in nutrition. Her blood pressure remains under control with medication. She's also nearly 100 pounds below her heaviest weight, and she hikes, bikes, and lifts weights to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A "masochistic" work ethic&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://providerwire.com/psychiatry-physician/california/camp-pendleton/savannah-woodward-1063946721" target="_blank"&gt;Savannah Woodward&lt;/a&gt;, a California psychiatrist, is among a group of physicians trying to bring attention to the detrimental effects of shame and develop strategies to prevent and mitigate it. While this effort is in the early stages, she co-led a session on the spiral of shame at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in May.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If physicians don't acknowledge shame in themselves, they can risk depression,&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1931720425000285?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt; burnout&lt;/a&gt;, sleeping difficulties, and other ripple effects that erode patient care, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We often don't talk about how important the human connection is in medicine," Woodward said. "But if your doctor is burned out or feeling like they don't deserve to be your doctor, patients feel that. They can tell."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a survey conducted this year, 37% of graduating students&lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/report/graduation-questionnaire-gq" target="_blank"&gt; reported feeling publicly embarrassed&lt;/a&gt; at some point in medical school, and nearly 20% described public humiliation, according to an annual survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Medical students and physician residents are already prone to perfectionism, along with an almost "masochistic" work ethic, as Woodward described it. Then they're run a gantlet of exams and years of training, amid constant scrutiny and with patients' lives on the line.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During training, physicians work in teams and make presentations to teaching faculty about a patient's medical issues and their recommended treatment approach. "You trip over your words. You miss things. You get things out of order. You go blank," Bynum said. And then shame creeps in, he said, leading to other debilitating thoughts, such as "'I'm no good at this. I'm an idiot. Everyone around me would have done this so much better.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet shame remains "a crack in your armor, that you don't want to show," said&lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/karly-ann-pippitt" target="_blank"&gt; Karly Pippitt&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at the University of Utah who has taught medical students about the potential for shame as part of a broader ethics and humanities course.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You're taking care of a human life," she said. "Heaven forbid that you act like you're not capable or you show fear."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Stop the shame cycle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When teaching students about shame, the goal is to help future physicians recognize the emotion in themselves and others, so they don't perpetuate the cycle, Pippitt said. "If you felt shamed throughout your medical education, it normalizes that as the experience," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Above all, physicians-in-training can work to reframe their mindset when they receive a poor grade or struggle to master a new skill, said Woodward, the California psychiatrist. Instead of believing that they've failed as a physician, they can focus on what they got wrong and ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last year, Bynum started teaching Duke physicians about shame competence, beginning with roughly 20 OB-GYN physician residents. This year, he launched a larger initiative with&lt;a href="https://www.shamelab.org/home" target="_blank"&gt; The Shame Lab&lt;/a&gt;, a research and training partnership between Duke University and the University of Exeter in England that he co-founded, to reach about 300 people across Duke's Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, including faculty and physician residents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This sort of training is rare among Duke OB-GYN resident&lt;a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/personnel/canice-dancel-md" target="_blank"&gt; Canice Dancel&lt;/a&gt;'s peers in other programs. Dancel, who completed the training, now strives to support students as they learn skills such as how to suture. She hopes they will pay that approach forward in "a chain reaction of being kind to each other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than a decade after Bynum experienced that stressful emergency delivery, he still regrets that shame kept him from checking on the mother as he usually would following delivery. "I was too scared of how she was going to react to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a little devastating," he said, when a colleague later told him that the mother wished he had stopped by. "She had passed a message along to thank me for saving her baby's life. If I had just given myself a chance to hear that, that would have really helped in my recovery, to be forgiven."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This lemon and turmeric chicken soup is comforting and packed with protein. Turmeric, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, gives the soup its vibrant yellow hue. It’s the perfect meal for when you’re sick or simply warming up on a chilly day. We love tender-crisp baby kale, but chopped kale or baby spinach can be used in its place.

"A good example of this is the habit of wearing a seatbelt. Most people don't anticipate getting into an accident, but if it happens, wearing a seatbelt decreases the risk of serious injury or death."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may have been doing yard work for &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;as long as you've buckled your seatbelt. In fact, mowing the lawn may have been your first job as an older teen. However, emergency room physicians note that it's easy to feel so confident in your ability to do outdoor chores that you forget it's even more critical to maintain safe habits than to have a pristine lawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ER doctors reveal the two things they wish you'd stop doing in your front yard and the easy ways to cut these habits from your routine.

Lawnmowers have additional hazards that floors do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you slip on wet grass or stumble on uneven ground, your foot can slide under the mower deck," Dr. Kopolovich continues. "The blade can amputate your toes or a significant portion of your foot as it spins at more than 200 mph. At this speed, small rocks, twigs or pieces of metal are turned into high-velocity projectiles."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since open-toed shoes offer zero protection, he reveals that these projectile objects can easily break the delicate bones in your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the solution to this one is probably right next to your flip-flops in your closet. "Sturdy shoes with non-slip soles should be worn," Dr. Lee advises. "Work boots or hiking boots serve as good examples of shoes that can protect feet when operating a lawnmower." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-eye-health-according-to-ophthalmologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Common Habit That Could Be Damaging Your Vision, According to Ophthalmologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Common Habit That Could Be Damaging Your Vision, According to Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Worst Lawnmower Habit for Eye Health and How To Avoid It&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye injuries may not have made the top two most common injuries in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Emergency Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Emergency Medicine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;/em&gt;report. Still, ER doctors emphasize it's crucial not to overlook how poor yard work habits can alter your vision—sometimes permanently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There are multiple risks involved with mowing without eye protection," Dr. Conroy warns. "Most commonly, sometimes the mower can produce flying debris that could strike and injure your eye. In addition, at times, fertilizers and chemicals that have been applied to the lawn can become airborne and irritate the eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid these injuries, emergency room doctors suggest protecting your peepers. However, you don't want just any old pair of goggles—and sunglasses certainly won't cut it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is important when picking a pair of safety goggles or glasses to choose one that provides certified protection against impact as well as chemical exposure," Dr. Conroy says. "Additionally, choosing a pair that is rated as ‘anti-fog’ is helpful to minimize any potential obstruction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kopolovich advises people to look for an "ANSI Z87.1" rating on their eyewear, which indicates it provides impact protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically, it's stamped on the frame or lens," he says. "They can typically be purchased at hardware or home improvement stores. You can also purchase a wrap-around style, which protects your eyes from debris coming from the front and the sides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/hip-flexor-stretches-for-people-over-50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Simple Stretch Physical Therapists Want Everyone Over 50 To Do Daily;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Simple Stretch Physical Therapists Want Everyone Over 50 To Do Daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Yard Work Safety Tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covering your feet and eyes when mowing the lawn is crucial. However, emergency doctors wish people knew a few more things before heading out to do yard work. They share five more tips to help you stay safe and avoid the ER when maintaining your outdoor oasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Dress for safety success&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mowing the lawn can make you sweat, but it's better to need a shower post-chores than an ER visit. Wearing the pants—and other layers of protection—is important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In addition to eye protection and sturdy shoes with non-slip soles, pants should be worn while mowing the lawn," Dr. Lee stresses. "When operating a gas-powered mower, earplugs or muffs that provide adequate noise reduction should be used to prevent hearing loss."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says that work gloves can protect your hands from debris and blisters that can form when you push the lawnmower for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Don't DIY debris removal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kaplan says one of the most common mistakes that lands people in his ER is attempting to remove debris from under their lawnmower. The consequences can be devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This often results in finger and hand lacerations and amputations," He reports. "Never place your hands near the lawnmower blades. Always ensure a lawnmower has been turned off and you have clear visibility to examine the blades and engine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Check your form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good form isn't just important when working out. In fact, all of that core work you do at the gym can pay dividends if you tap into it when doing yard work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Walk upright and engage your core," Dr. Kopolovich advises. "Let the mower's power do the work—you are there to guide it. Avoid hunching over. When turning, take small steps instead of twisting your spine to prevent back strain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Beware of burn risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burns are also common when mowing the lawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is easy to forget how hot the engine can get from running as well as just being out in the sun," Dr. Conroy shares. "This is a risk for children as well, who might be playing around the mower after it's done and touch a hot part of the engine without realizing it. The best advice is either putting the mower away safely once done, or putting it somewhere where there are no children or pets."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On that note...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Do a scene check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that you may want your kids or grandkids to see you mow the lawn as a way to set an example. However, have it be from a distance (they also shouldn't "help" you mow the lawn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A person operating a lawnmower may not be aware that a child is nearby and may accidentally run them over," Dr. Lee says. "Allowing a child to sit with a person operating a riding lawnmower introduces the risk of the child falling and being injured by the mower blade.  Objects launched by a lawn mower or weed trimmer can injure anyone who happens to be nearby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that you'll also want to check your work area for a few inanimate objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before mowing, inspect the lawn to assure it is clear of rocks, sticks or other objects," Dr. Lee recommends.

        &lt;p&gt;Research out today finds that a substantial portion of people have a sensitivity to gluten or wheat but don’t have celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK and elsewhere reviewed dozens of studies conducted across the globe. They estimate that about one in every ten people worldwide report having a condition called non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity, or NCGWS. They also found that people with NCGWS are more likely to have other health issues, including anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings highlight that “NCGWS is both common and linked to a significant emotional and psychological burden,” lead author Mohamed Shiha, a gastroenterologist at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A systematic look&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Various studies in recent years have tried to assess the toll of NCGWS. But according to Shiha, theirs is the first to systematically pool together and evaluate this data to provide reliable figures on the worldwide prevalence of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately analyzed 25 studies conducted between 2014 and 2024 across 16 countries, collectively involving nearly 50,000 adults. Overall, they found that the global rate of self-reported NCGWS was 10.3%, though this could vary widely between countries. In the UK, for instance, the rate was 23%, while in Chile, it was 0.3%. About 5% of Americans reported having NCGWS, though this estimate is based on a single study.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms associated with NCGWS were gastrointestinal and included bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. But some people also reported symptoms like fatigue, joint pains, and headaches. Women were more likely to report having NCGWS, and NCGWS was more common in people with depression, anxiety, and IBS. Less than half of people with the condition (40%) reported sticking to a gluten-free diet as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/gutjnl-2025-336304"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A broad umbrella&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While celiac disease can be screened for with a simple blood test, there is no standard criteria or reliable markers for diagnosing NCGWS. And it seems to be a complex condition with no single, unifying cause, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that NCGWS is an umbrella term that describes a broad group of individuals with wheat or gluten-related symptoms that often stem from different underlying mechanisms, ranging from gut–brain interaction disorders like IBS to psychological and social factors, rather than a single, uniform biological condition,” Shiha said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some cases, it could be akin to a social contagion. Rising public awareness and media attention might influence how “people interpret their symptoms,” he explained. In other cases, NCGWS could be getting mixed up with other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Most cases may not be directly related to gluten or wheat themselves but rather overlap with irritable bowel syndrome and other gut–brain interaction disorders such as functional dyspepsia,” Shiha said. “The significant association we found with IBS, anxiety, and depression supports this hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just last week, a review in the Lancet &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; evidence that most people with a professed gluten sensitivity are actually more likely to be sensitive to fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) or to other wheat ingredients. This review also argued some cases could be caused by a nocebo effect, or the mere expectation that eating gluten will cause harm—a finding echoed by a small clinical trial &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gluten-could-be-wrongly-blamed-for-americans-stomach-troubles-2000632584"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this July.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Whatever the causes, more should be done to properly diagnose and treat these cases, the authors say. To that end, the team is working on creating clearer, symptom-based criteria for identifying NCGWS. “We also want to explore how to best manage these symptoms without resorting to unnecessary restrictive diets, which can affect quality of life and nutrition,” Shiha said.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WE have been plunged into autumn gloominess, especially now the clocks have gone back. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The darker evenings can affect our &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sleep/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, mood and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/energy/"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_37152674" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tucking into a fruity crumble packed with berries could help lift your mood after the clocks go back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you struggle moving into &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/autumn/"&gt;autumn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt;, Laura Stott has these tips to help you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRA TIME IN BED: &lt;/strong&gt;Heading to bed just 30 minutes earlier as evenings draw in could benefit both your body and your mind. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/37062445/when-clocks-go-back-2025-date/" rel=""&gt;Darker nights and shorter days&lt;/a&gt; can derail our circadian rhythms – the body’s internal clock that regulates our mood, mindset, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37080651/why-tired-all-the-time-sleep/" rel=""&gt;sleep patterns and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gradually resetting your natural patterns by turning in earlier to sleep while it’s dark and then rising earlier to maximise daylight can help you adjust to any post-clock-change “&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/2364499/jet-lag-symptoms-tips-cure/" rel=""&gt;jet-lag&lt;/a&gt;” effects. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		

&lt;figure id="attachment_37152663" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting outside for daylight first thing – for the likes of putting your bins out – can boost your mood and keep your body clock on track&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE THE BINS OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s tempting to hit snooze on your alarm and pull the covers back over your head when it’s cold outside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But ensuring &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/23411893/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad-symptoms-summer/" rel=""&gt;exposure to daylight&lt;/a&gt; straight after rising will boost your wellbeing as the light on your face tells your brain that it’s time to wake up and get going. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helps regulate the hormone melatonin, which keeps your body clock in check. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting outside first thing, even if it’s just to take out the rubbish or drink your first cuppa, could keep your natural rhythms consistent – even when it’s overcast or rainy. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAT A CRUMBLE: &lt;/strong&gt;Scoffing a yummy fruit crumble could help you to combat low mood that can set in after the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/clocks-change/"&gt;clocks change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show blueberries, raspberries and strawberries are top picks for those with seasonal slumps as they contain vitamin C and polyphenols, which encourage the production of mood-boosting hormones dopamine and serotonin. &lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;They also reduce the stress hormone cortisol. Keep a bag of berries in the freezer and chomp on them in desserts or smoothies, or as a winter-proofing wellbeing snack. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152665" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brighten your mood and beat winter lethargy by adding a few mood-boosting houseplants to your home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY A POT PLANT: &lt;/strong&gt;To push back against lethargy get some &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/37109916/plants-home-boost-wellbeing/" rel=""&gt;houseplants&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that tending to them can make us feel brighter, so pop a pot or two on your windowsill to banish the blues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opt for indoor blooms that cope well with low light, such as a peace lily or colourful blooming cyclamen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even colourful fake blooms can give you a boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RIGHT GEAR: &lt;/strong&gt;We know regular exercise is a great way to feel and stay well all year round, but when it’s dark outside, it’s too easy to stay on the sofa instead of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/fitness-and-exercise/" rel=""&gt;heading out for a run or to the gym&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invest in the right gear – waterproofs, winter workout wear, thermal undies and socks – to motivate yourself to get moving whatever the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/weather-2/"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152704" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beating the dark-evening blues can be as simple as meeting friends — socialising is proven to lift your mood and ease stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEET  MATES: &lt;/strong&gt;Many of us don’t feel like socialising when it gets darker, but spending time with friends or family is proven to lift mood, reduce negative feelings and even reduce stress, so grab a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coffee/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; with your bestie, arrange a date night or join a club. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152667" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies show fairy lights really can make us happier by causing a release of the feel-good hormone dopamine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET  CRISTMAS LIGHTS UP: &lt;/strong&gt;It might only be October but getting the fairy lights up could be just the mood boost you need if the dark evenings are getting you down. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show fairy lights really can make us happier by causing a release of the feel-good hormone dopamine. Just don’t get the rest of the decorations out yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADJUST YOUR TIMERS:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t forget to reset any timers that don’t update automatically, such as heating, smart lights and sound systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heating and lighting that aren’t working in line with your new daily routine may make it harder for your body to adjust. &lt;/p&gt;

As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5759ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b716d4" class="body-graf"&gt;There are multiple criteria for losing an official &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-minnesota-double-us-outbreaks-vaccine-continue-rcna235144" target="_blank"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f6911" class="body-graf"&gt;But the most significant factor is having &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing measles transmission&lt;/a&gt; for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“To really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,” said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-245cd2" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada hit that mark this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98515" class="body-graf"&gt;PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89502" class="body-graf"&gt;If a country loses its measles elimination status, “a corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,” according to a PAHO spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79b294" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b234b" class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S., at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ec86" class="body-graf"&gt;It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-456c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada “was a huge achievement,” Salas said. “When we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d7af7" class="body-graf"&gt;The possibility of elimination status in Canada is “a wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don’t have outbreaks like this,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an&lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/video/2025/10/28/consequences-of-canada-losing-its-measles-free-status/" target="_blank"&gt; interview this week with CTV Television Network&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae3d5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC.

Friends are now sending me articles and clippings about cancer research and the promise of new therapies. If they had actually READ these articles, they would see that clinical trials on humans are far off, or that the type of cancer referred to in the article is different from what my relative has. Why offer hope when there is none? The same thing happened to me when I had cancer 20 years ago. In one instance, I received an article about how to prevent the cancer I already had! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXM6KMBFG5FKNHGGY3YSD7YYRQ"&gt;Please remind your readers that although these items are most often sent with love, they do little to help the individual experiencing the illness and treatment and can cause anger and pain.

Out of a need to do SOMETHING, they will send articles, some of which are inappropriate. While I agree that the most reliable source of information about cancer is your relative’s oncologist, and that readers need to be aware of the message they are trying to send, please understand they are being sent out of a desire to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:JCTHKWRFJJDRFIJQNOK7YPPLDQ" data-fusion-component="JCTHKWRFJJDRFIJQNOK7YPPLDQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:JCTHKWRFJJDRFIJQNOK7YPPLDQ" data-fusion-component="JCTHKWRFJJDRFIJQNOK7YPPLDQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ITOXU2DQ3JGHNAMSVLBXHB3CVM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/staff/AbigailVanBuren/posts.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cleveland.com/staff/AbigailVanBuren/posts.html "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;See all “Dear Abby” columns&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PTNPHJIKCREIJDKORG7KQRR7CQ"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

    &lt;p&gt;As more Americans turn to weight loss drugs, the U.S. adult &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/change-obese-definition-could-put-70-us-adults-category-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;obesity rate&lt;/a&gt; is declining, according to new &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;survey data from Gallup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data published Tuesday showed the obesity rate among participants has gradually declined to 37% in 2025 after previously hitting a record high of 39.9% in 2022. Results were based on data from three nationally representative surveys of 16,946 U.S. adults interviewed by web in the first three quarters of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a statistically meaningful decrease representing an estimated 7.6 million fewer obese adults compared with three years ago," the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the report, obesity was defined using the federal standard of having a BMI of 30 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also explored the simultaneous increase in GLP-1 drug usage for weight loss, including semaglutides like &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/ozempic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zepbound-wegovy-study-comparing-weight-loss-drugs/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. These drugs are also used to treat type 2 diabetes, which the report noted was still at an all-time high, with 13.8% of Gallup's &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246200/gallup-national-health-index-work.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Well-Being Index&lt;/a&gt; participants saying they've been diagnosed with the chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gallup first measured GLP-1 usage in February 2024, 5.8% of adults reported taking this type of medicine for weight loss. Now, the percentage has increased to 12.4%, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amid increased use of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss, obesity rates have been coming down for most age groups since 2022," the report added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found the biggest reduction in obesity was among those aged 40 to 49 and those aged 50 to 64. These are the same age groups with the highest rates of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report does have some limitations, however, including potential bias in how respondents present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, because Gallup's method of collecting self-reported weight and height has been consistent, the trend still provides valuable information regarding changes over time," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallup also did not measure GLP-1 usage for weight loss in 2022 or 2023, but said available data via its &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246200/gallup-national-health-index-work.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Well-Being Index&lt;/a&gt; are "consistent with reports of steadily increasing use since the initial FDA approval in 2021."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the reported decline in obesity rates, the U.S. continues to exceed many Western countries in weight, the report pointed out — but expanding access to weight loss treatments may be a factor in the obesity decline becoming a lasting trend, the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 40% of adults in the U.S. are obese, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obesity-rate-us-adults-cdc-data-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in September 2024 — marking the first time in over a decade that the nation's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/overweight-obese-world-obesity-federation-report/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rate has not inched up, results from the federal government's national health survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;

These vitamins lower homocysteine, a substance that can harm memory and thinking when levels get too high. They also help your brain make neurotransmitters (important brain chemicals), such as serotonin and dopamine, which influence mood, memory, and focus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that getting enough B6, B9, and B12 may help &lt;strong&gt;slow brain atrophy (age-related brain shrinkage) and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/supplements-for-memory-8713677" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support memory&lt;/a&gt; in older adults&lt;/strong&gt;. Studies are less clear on whether these vitamins can actually prevent dementia.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While B vitamins aren’t a cure-all for brain health, they’re important for keeping your mind working properly, especially as you age.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most adults, the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is about 1.3-2 milligrams of B6, 400 micrograms of folate, and 2.4 micrograms of B12. While many people can get enough from food, people following a vegan diet and older adults may need a supplement, especially for B12.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This protection may help preserve memory and keep your brain working well as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies suggest that vitamin E &lt;strong&gt;may slow memory loss in people with &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/alzheimers-disease-causes-7092835" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, while others find little benefit for healthy adults. Because high-dose supplements can increase health risks, it’s best to focus on food sources of vitamin E, which appear most helpful for brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The RDA for vitamin E is 15 milligrams (22.4 international units (IU)) per day for adults.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research also shows that people &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/mind-body/vitamin-d-health-risks" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;deficient in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; often perform worse on memory and thinking tests. While supplements don't seem to benefit people with normal vitamin D levels, maintaining healthy vitamin D through sunlight, diet, or supplementation when needed is important for brain and mental health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The RDA for vitamin D is 600 IU (15 micrograms) per day for people ages 1-70, and 800 IU (20 micrograms) per day for adults over age 70. Some people may need higher doses if they are deficient in vitamin D, but it’s best to &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d-test-8712026" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;check blood levels&lt;/a&gt; and consult with a healthcare provider before taking supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research on multivitamins and brain health is mixed. Some studies show that they &lt;strong&gt;may improve memory and attention in older adults&lt;/strong&gt;, while others find little effect.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A daily multivitamin can be useful if your diet is limited or you have higher nutrient needs. However, it’s not a substitute for a well-balanced diet, and high doses of certain vitamins can be harmful.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one-size-fits-all dosage, since multivitamin formulations vary widely. Most standard multivitamins provide close to 100% of the Daily Value (DV) for key nutrients. Choosing a reputable brand with appropriate levels, without megadoses, is generally recommended.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While vitamins and supplements can support brain health, they’re not without risks. Taking more than your body needs may lead to side effects, and in some cases, &lt;strong&gt;high doses can be harmful&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a supplement, look for third-party testing or certifications that verify quality and purity. Avoid products that promise “miracle cures” or contain megadoses far above the recommended daily values.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also important to remember that supplements can interact with medications. &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-k-benefits-8551226" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can interfere with blood thinners, while high-dose fish oil may increase bleeding risk if combined with certain drugs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new vitamin or supplement regimen, it’s best to consult with a healthcare provider. They can help determine whether you have a deficiency, recommend the right dosage, and make sure supplements are safe alongside your current medications.&lt;br&gt;

	&lt;p class="wp-block-propublica-iframe__wrapper"&gt;
		
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve reported on Idaho’s anti-vaccination movement for the past 10 years, most recently for ProPublica. &lt;a href="https://archive.is/p3QsN"&gt;I’ve written about&lt;/a&gt; people moving to Idaho as self-described “refugees” from states where vaccines are required for school. After the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, I wrote about Idaho’s low COVID-19 vaccination rate and, later, &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/09/17/inside-an-idaho-hospital-on-thursday-morning-a-slower-rolling-mass-casualty/"&gt;how that contributed&lt;/a&gt; to deaths and the near-collapse of our hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, the debate over vaccine policy and the rationales of the people behind the anti-vaccination movement fascinate me, even as the work comes with the weight of reporting on what can be, in some cases, life-or-death stakes. But I’m not just a journalist. I’m an Idahoan with a family, including a young child in school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, I held both of those identities as I published &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;a story about Idaho becoming the first state in the nation to ban vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;. The Idaho Medical Freedom Act makes it illegal to require almost anyone to take a vaccine, test or other “medical intervention.” The law’s author, Leslie Manookian, is a finance executive turned practitioner of homeopathy who became a leader in the “health freedom” movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watch-leslie-manookian-and-allies-celebrate-idaho-medical-freedom-act"&gt;Watch Leslie Manookian and Allies Celebrate Idaho Medical Freedom Act&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I first heard Manookian’s name in the mid-2010s, when she was part of a group seeking to change Idaho’s school vaccination laws and rules, among other things. She went on to create the Health Freedom Defense Fund, which brought several lawsuits over vaccine and mask mandates during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. She lives in one of the few Idaho communities that wholeheartedly embraced COVID-19 precautions, and she has described feeling ostracized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our interview and follow-up calls, Manookian told me about her stance on vaccines, what she believes the role of public health should be and her longtime desire to pass the Idaho Medical Freedom Act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the background of our conversation: a &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report"&gt;national measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that is larger than the U.S. has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One big change with the Idaho Medical Freedom Act is how schools and day cares can respond if, or when, measles arrives. The law makes it illegal to send home kids who aren’t vaccinated, as long as they are “healthy.” That has important implications when it comes to measles, which can spread for days before the contagious person even realizes they’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a person who lives here, I can’t help but think about this. My family is vaccinated, but what if a student at my child’s school can’t be immunized for some reason; what will their parents do if measles begins to spread? What about my friends with kids too young to be immunized, who still need to go to day care? Does the new law keep them from choosing what they believe is best for their child?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I posed that question to an ally of Manookian’s, Mary Holland, the CEO of Children’s Health Defense, a national organization that’s become one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements in states like California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her answer underscored how this law isn’t just about policy. It is about flipping the script on what we’ve considered the norm for generations now: that if you’re going to be part of a community, you must help protect the other people in your community. The thinking behind the Idaho Medical Freedom Act not only rejects that norm when it comes to vaccines, it makes it illegal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A week after my interview with Manookian, the duality of being a reporter covering vaccine policies and a parent of a school-aged child again came into sharp focus. I was standing outside my child’s school, chatting with the school nurse. She is in charge of many things, but in particular, knowing our school’s vaccination rates, fending off outbreaks and deciding if kids are too sick to be at school. As we talked, my phone buzzed with a call from Manookian to continue our conversation about the upcoming story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s always my goal as a journalist to ensure accurate and fair coverage. I wanted to include Manookian’s voice because of how much influence she has over public health rules in Idaho. So I worked to faithfully describe her beliefs and how she arrived at them, but I also had a duty to spell out the wide array of scientific evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our discussions, Manookian told me her driving goal is to keep people from being coerced into something they don’t believe is right, no matter what. It’s also her belief that vaccines are dangerous and that infectious diseases are beneficial. (That risk-benefit calculus is not supported by the overwhelming body of evidence, not even by studies the movement relies on.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an Idahoan, I pay close attention to what’s happening around me, so that I can make informed decisions. As a journalist, it’s my job to help readers understand the thinking behind changes to public policy and where those ideas come from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I reported this week, Manookian doesn’t just have her eyes on Idaho. She intends to take this law to other states and believes it can be a model for the country. I’ll have my eyes on that, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can read my full story, which includes my interview with Manookian, for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If the female does not give this subtle, but crucial, signal, the male’s efforts fail, and copulation does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito sex lasts only a few seconds, and usually occurs in mid-air. These factors, combined with the minute size of the genitals, have made it difficult to study exactly what’s going on, Vosshall says, adding that the scientists who previously studied mosquito breeding probably just shrugged and said, “Yeah, the male is in charge.” Her team’s findings, which could have implications for controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes, were published today in the journal &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fluorescent sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the intricate mating process of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; — the main species of mosquito that transmits dengue — Vosshall and colleagues first engineered transgenic males that produce either green or red fluorescent sperm. Then they put some of each type into a cage with females of the same species for seven days. When the females were dissected at the end of that period, more than 90% of them had sperm of only one colour stored in their bodies, supporting the idea that they mate only once in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second set of experiments, the team filmed the mating process using an elaborate set-up. The researchers glued a female mosquito to a metal pin, so that she could move her wings and legs but not fly away, like a trapeze artist in a rigid tether. They then introduced free-flying males into the cage, and recorded the interactions between the male and female genitals at high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A black and white microscopy photograph of the external genitalia of male mosquito, with the gonostyli in an 'X' shape." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Male &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes use drumstick-like genital structures called gonostyli (shown here, crossed) to tap on the genitalia of females when initiating sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: H. Amalia Pasolli, Anurag Sharma/The Rockefeller University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah Houri-Zeevi, a researcher in Vosshall’s lab, spent hundreds of hours looking at the videos, frame by frame. She noticed that when a male is trying to copulate, he doesn’t simply extend his sex organ — the equivalent of a penis — towards the female. Instead, he first taps the female genitalia with drumstick-like structures called gonostyli. In response to the tapping, a virgin female might elongate the tip of her genitalia, to enable copulation. Houri-Zeevi noticed that non-virgin females, however, typically kept their genitals retracted, blocking further mating attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

for one-and-a-half days sounds like something most people wouldn't ever want to experience, but some claim that there can be some fascinating effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some people have traditionally chosen to fast for religious reasons, though now fasting is as likely to be the result of a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; fad than an act of solidarity to one's faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Effects of cutting food &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/24-hours-fasting-effects-on-body-simulation-477471-20250806"&gt;out for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; have been outlined before, but today it's about going the extra step and swearing off food for 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Normally, drinking some water or coffee is allowed as part of the fast - but it won't be able to replace the food-shaped hole you'll experience in your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Waiting 36 hours for a bite can be extremely difficult (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;

that prolonged fasting 'should only be conducted under medical supervision', adding: "Long-term fasts are not recommended for most people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Intermittent fasting may be popular online due to its supposed &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits, but it's said that missing all three meals in a day can make a difference without killing you, as our ancestors once lived on irregular meals due to the need to hunt and harvest produce all year round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While the benefits are disputed, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/science"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; studies claim that a number of things happen to your body in a 36-hour fasting period, with the video in question saying your body undergoes some 'incredible transformations'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;At this stage, digestion shuts down and insulin drops fast, meaning that your body starts to burn stored glucose for energy, instead of breaking down incoming carbohydrates into glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your blood sugar levels will start to dip around this point, with your system beginning to 'dig into its backup reserves', using glycogen, another form of stored glucose, for energy, with functionality getting slightly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The simulation suggests that 'the real transformation begins' at this point, as your body starts to burn fat as insulin hits rock-bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your body then enters ketosis, according to the video, meaning your body becomes a 'fatmelting furnace', producing and using ketone bodies to turn fat into fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline notes that this process can result in decreased appetite and weight loss, as well as fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Described as 'your body's built-in detox mode', autophagy starts to take effect as your body begins to recycle and break down damaged cells, flushing out waste as it repairs you 'from the inside out'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your body will start to consume its own tissue this way, as Cleveland Clinic &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that the process includes getting rid of nonfunctional cell parts and removing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They add: "Autophagy isn’t a clear-cut harmful or beneficial process concerning disease prevention or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"There’s not enough research to support inducing autophagy as a wellness strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cleveland Clinic advises you to reach out to a professional if you're considering any lifestyle changes which could be detrimental to your bodily processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Your body carries out a number of biological processes (YouTube/The Limitless Emperor)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is where 'cellular repair' speeds up, according to the video - meaning that the body starts burning pure fat, with all the cells in the body working overtime in what is also known as a 'deep repair'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Inflammation in the body also decreases as sensitivity to insulin improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;At this point, the video claims, growth hormone skyrockets, which could help to protect muscles and boost recovery from exercise or workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After a day and a half, it's claimed that the body will hit peak autophagy, with dead cells discarded and tissues regenerating efficiently while the metabolism starts to 'fire on all cylinder' in what the simulation describes as a 'full body reset'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's vital to remember that health experts urged those considering fasting diets of any sort to consult a medical professional beforehand, to avoid any issues or complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline writes: "Fasting always has medical impacts and should not be taken lightly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It goes on to advise you to talk to a professional before trying intermittent fasting - and adds that prolonged fasting should always be medically supervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:03:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPWmRwSmxRN1FMN2taZzZiUkxMNThYNE5tUnV6WElzWEpuWGpKMmN6ZEI0NUpUSFZCM0VkclhHUWJQZm45SHZ2Ykoyb3FaZVlFVm4yMEZoeFRxUlVVVU85WEN0YkM3TVJtcm1qR2JacUhKVWZMTTQ3SEV1QnU5aEFtU05iX3dOWm9rdDFKSlFqSjQ1TnJQdXNteA</guid></item><item><title>根据培训师的说法， 6种力量锻炼可以在45岁后比有氧运动更快地对抗衰老-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/6-best-strength-exercises-after-45/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
													
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Once you hit 45, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-workouts-to-look-younger/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; becomes one of the best things you can do for long-term health and wellness. While many tend to focus on cardio or general physical activity, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/resistance-band-exercises-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; is what keeps you “strong, mobile, and independent” with age, says &lt;b&gt;Clif Marshall&lt;/b&gt;, senior director of coaching and pro training at&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.d1training.com/" target="_blank"&gt; D1 Training&lt;/a&gt;. So, we’ve rounded up the best &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/essential-strength-exercises-trainers-recommend/" target="_blank"&gt;strength exercises&lt;/a&gt; to start this week after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why strength training&lt;i&gt; really&lt;/i&gt; matters after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we reach our mid-40s, the body naturally begins to lose muscle mass and strength, which happens faster if someone remains inactive,” Marshall explains. “Muscles are metabolically active tissue, meaning they help regulate blood sugar, support hormone balance, and maintain a healthy metabolism. When muscle declines, metabolism slows, and it becomes easier to gain body fat even if your diet and activity levels stay the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, bone density declines, but resistance workouts place “healthy stress” on the bones, promoting new growth while decreasing the risk of injury and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your muscles do not have eyes, so any form of resistance can work for strength training, including bodyweight, resistance bands, dumbbells, kettlebells or barbells,” Marshall tells us. “In short, strength training is one of the best ways to fight aging from the inside out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/juliedsoul/#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ulie Dermer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, longtime master instructor at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.soul-cycle.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SoulCycle&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle influencer, and leader in the fitness space, compares lifting weights—or training with just your body weight—to hitting the “refresh” button on your entire system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It keeps muscle on your frame, bones strong, metabolism fired up, and confidence high. Plus, it’s not just about how you look, it’s about moving with power and ease in every part of your life,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6 Strength Exercises That Fight Aging After 45&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l83R5PblSMA?si=xViGaLuaDezPW87T" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodyweight &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; is a classic strength move that fires up the legs, glutes, and core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise builds lower-body strength and mobility, helping prevent falls and knee or hip issues,” Marshall says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the exercise by standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDIpL0pjun0?si=_qWJprSBhw2HOEK-" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushups engage the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core, making them one of the most efficient bodyweight moves you can weave into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise strengthens the upper body and improves shoulder stability and posture,” Marshall explains, noting to keep your body straight as you lower and press back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a high plank position with your hands under your shoulders and your body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a long, straight body as you lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up, straightening your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glute Bridges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp33YgPZgns?si=xynVl2XUZHhrFHro" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge fires up your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move supports lower-back health and hip strength, which supports the development of balance and pain-free movement,” Marshall notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with bent knees and feet hip-width apart on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your buttocks, holding at the top for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your hips back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform glute bridges for 3 sets of 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B296mZDhrP4?si=h9m56rs6qoDsCoyk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/" target="_blank"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent test of core strength. This move engages the core, shoulders, and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Planks build core endurance, which supports posture and reduces the risk of back pain,” Marshall says, noting to keep your body straight while maintaining a tight core throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press into the pads of your fingers and hug your inner arm toward your armpit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk your feet out to hip-width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your abs, squeeze your buttocks, and pull upward through your quads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 20 to 45-second holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bent-Over Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gvmcqr226U?si=aj-PirKmjMTIxdmR" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bent-over rows activate the shoulders, biceps, and mid-to-upper back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move strengthens the back and counteracts the forward posture common with aging and desk work,” Marshall says, stressing to pull the weights toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together, and slowly lowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at the hips until your torso is parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This exercise improves leg strength, balance, and coordination – important for preventing falls,” Marshall explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet parallel and hip-distance apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your hands to your hips.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t panic. If you discover your child is itchy and has pinworms symptoms, this is what you can expect.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:57am &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Number one, out of sheer humiliation and panic this article is being submitted anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Number two,  BCP says they’re the big sister we all need, so of course, at 12:26 a.m. I type “pinworms” into their search bar fully confident they’ll walk me through this one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: I’m met with nothing remotely helpful enough! One post that comes up in the search lets me know &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/what-to-stock-in-your-medicine-cabinet/"&gt;what I should stock in my medicine cabinet&lt;/a&gt; – including one pinworm medication recommendation that I don’t have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-prata-font-family"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;But I needed more tips.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to journal my family’s struggle with this nuisance and share what I can with you. Please, fellow moms, help me by leaving comments below in regards to what has helped for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my limited Googling at 1 a.m., I discovered that pinworms are pretty common in children, especially girls. It’s extremely catchy. Important preventative measures include keeping nails short and clean as much as possible, and washing hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before eating. For context, I pride myself in being a clean and efficient balabusta. We wash our linen weekly, shower nightly, and change towels daily. We also cut nails every Friday. So I’m feeling pretty despondent and a little grossed out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most effective and common treatment seems to be &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/what-to-stock-in-your-medicine-cabinet/"&gt;Reese’s PinX – and like BCP shared in this post&lt;/a&gt;, and as they noted, it would be wise to keep a bottle at home because pinworms tend to reveal themselves during the night. See? Between Carpools WAS being a good &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/the-6-feminine-products-only-a-big-sister-will-tell-you-about/"&gt;big sister&lt;/a&gt;. I just feel like we can have a longer conversation about this! (A friend later tells me &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4qAL2kK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;PinRid&lt;/a&gt; has a much better flavor and comes in chewable form.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also read that it might be wise to treat the whole family at this point since pinworms are highly contagious. I also read that some pediatricians recommend taking the dose again in two weeks to prevent further infestation. But now let’s continue and see what my doctor said in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I know that my child has pinworms? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Note that pinworms can also occur in adults. My friend had pinworms post-birth and her Dr. said it sometimes gets picked up after a hospital stay.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically the patient will wake up during the night with extreme itchiness. If you shine a flashlight to the itchy spot, it’s likely you will see a worm (or worms) crawling out of the vaginal or anal areas (or both). Do not panic–that will not help. If you have the medicine at home, you’re lucky. We didn’t since this is our first rodeo. I did not tell my precious princess that she has pinworms; she’s 7 and I don’t see how that’s helpful information for her to have at 1 a.m. Or ever. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After trying to hold her hands while laying next to her, I see she’s really suffering and I give her a MeloChew (use at your own discretion) and a dose of Benadryl. This stops the itching and helps her fall asleep within the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, she’s asleep, maybe I get some sleep too? Mind over matter. I can forget the visual of that worm for now–can’t I?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:08 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hi Dr. Roth ? My daughter has pinworms–help!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medication is delivered within the hour and my daughter takes her first dose right away. The nurse said to give her a second dose in 7-10 days. She doesn’t think we need to treat the whole family at this point. I’m not sure how I feel about that. Seeing as I laid in her bed last night, I’ll definitely be taking the over-the-counter dose. I think her brother who’s closest to her age will be taking it too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I stripped everyone’s linen to reduce the risk of any stray eggs working their dark magic again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:30 a.m. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m so grateful we got through this with only one night of drama. I’m so grateful my daughter slept the night. In the last two days I learned that high sugar intake increases the likelihood of pinworms since they feed on it. It seems that pinworms live in the intestines and a known natural remedy is garlic which can be taken in vitamin or suppository form. I welcome any feedback from moms who’ve tried that or anything else that has helped. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now keep &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/43FmQn4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;PinRid&lt;/a&gt; on hand. Somehow I feel like if we have it, we won’t need it. We survived this right of passage.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-025-02898-z" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Cardiovascular Diabetology in August 2025 further reinforced this link, that when hypertension is combined with elevated stress-related blood sugar levels, stroke risks spike significantly. Hypertension is such a dominant and well-established predictor that newer studies are now combining it with other biological markers to get an even better picture of the stroke risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While you are already aware of hypertension, there's one type of hypertension that is stronger and dangerous, because it stays high even after taking multiple medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand this type of hypertension, HT Lifestyle reached out to Dr Babu Ezhumalai, senior consultant - interventional cardiology, structural and endovascular interventions cardiology at MGM Healthcare in Chennai. He drew attention to this type of hypertension as it's ‘stubborn.’ It is called resistant hypertension (RHTN)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is resistant hypertension?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the cardiologist, resistant hypertension is more than ‘regular high blood pressure.’ If high blood pressure is dangerous, then this type takes it up a notch because it usually doesn't respond to medications as easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is a stubborn form where blood pressure stays high even after taking three or more medications, including a diuretic. What makes it especially concerning is its strong link to stroke, a risk many people are unaware of," Dr Ezhumalai said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further, the condition progresses quietly, as the cardiologist added, “By the time warning signs appear, organs like the heart, kidneys, and brain may already be under strain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cited a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/10/960/7067985" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 which found that, compared to patients without resistant hypertension, those with the condition had a 14 per cent higher risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this type of hypertension is left unchecked, Dr Ezhumalai alerted that the chances of strokes silently increase. “Patients with RHTN are more likely to experience strokes, often without any obvious warning.” Other than stroke, he added, this hypertension also raises the risk of organ damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“About 10% of people with high blood pressure may have RHTN. In India, millions may be at risk without realising it, because the condition often shows no symptoms until serious complications occur,” he said, adding that the lack of early warning signs makes consistent monitoring essential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the warning signs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/06/original/5909_1757168133533.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Headaches are one of the common signs.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“RHTN is usually silent. Headaches, dizziness, or nosebleeds may occur only in severe cases. Most damage to the heart, brain, and kidneys happens quietly over time," the cardiologist described some of the signs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant Hypertension can be managed with the help of lifestyle adjustments and medical care. Here are 4 key steps Dr Ezhumalai recommended for managing resistant hypertension: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular monitoring is essential: &lt;/strong&gt;Check your blood pressure at home and consider 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to detect hidden spikes or nocturnal hypertension, both key risk factors for stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Even stubborn blood pressure can respond to lifestyle changes. Following a DASH diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy, while reducing salt intake, can help lower blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, also contributes to better control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management and quality sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Managing stress and getting adequate sleep play an important role, as both help reduce strain on the heart and brain and support overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

New research suggests that following a certain diet can help slow down how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s called the green Mediterranean diet, and it’s a more plant-forward version of the classic &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. For the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614%2825%2900235-3/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers looked at data from 294 people who participated in a long-term study on diet and brain health called the DIRECT PLUS trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants followed either a classic Mediterranean diet, a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, or the green Mediterranean diet, which included foods like walnuts, green tea, and Mankai, a leafy green. The researchers tracked several health metrics for the participants at the start of the study and 18 months later. They discovered that people who followed the green Mediterranean diet had lower levels of certain proteins called galectin-9 and decorin that are linked with brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/iris-shai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iris Shai, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iris Shai, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author, adjunct professor at Harvard University, and a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/diet-body-metabolism-core/person/heidi-j-silver-phd-rd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heidi J.

Why might this be the case? Here’s what experts want you to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the green Mediterranean diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different interpretations of the green Mediterranean diet. But this study defined it as being low in meat and having 1,240 milligrams a day of polyphenols. (Polyphenols are plant-based compounds that help the body &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.806470/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manage inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;manage inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic Mediterranean diet embraces lean meats and fish, while the green Mediterranean diet focuses more on whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might these foods help slow brain aging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear why these foods may help slow brain aging, but there are a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of it comes down to the polyphenols, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/diet-body-metabolism-core/person/heidi-j-silver-phd-rd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heidi J. Silver, R.D., Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heidi J. Silver, R.D., Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., a research professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Polyphenols are phytochemicals found in many fruits and vegetables. They have both antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory processes,” she says. “Both of these processes have a major role in brain aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidant properties of polyphenols help tamp down on oxidative stress on tissues and cells, which may lower the risk of age-related damage to cells in the brain, Silver says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study specifically called out polyphenol-rich foods like walnuts, green tea, and mankai, but there are plenty of other foods that are high in polyphenols. Those &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/polyphenols-can-be-found-in-many-fresh-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; berries, apples, broccoli, and dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also found that foods rich in polyphenols may stimulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/15/7262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:growth of neurons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;growth of neurons&lt;/a&gt; (nerve cells) and connections between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421014252" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:synapses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Both of those are associated with younger brains. Also worth noting: Higher BDNF levels have been &lt;a href="https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-022-00279-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with a slower rate of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Keatley, R.D., Ph.D., co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, says these foods impact blood glucose, which has a big impact on the body. “Green tea, walnuts, and Mankai improve insulin sensitivity, stabilize post-meal glucose, and lower chronic inflammation. These are mechanisms that protect blood vessels in the brain and prevent the metabolic stress that accelerates neuronal loss,” he says. It’s important to note that more research is needed here to definitively say that these foods impact blood glucose management. Though some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6014790/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; finds polyphenols’ impact on blood sugars promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foods called out in the study have their own benefits, too. “Green tea contains an amino acid called l-theanine that supports cognition and mood,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N.,&lt;/a&gt; author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers. “&lt;/em&gt;For walnuts, they also contain omega-3s, which are essential for brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Mankai, it’s “uniquely dense in polyphenols, plant-based protein, vitamin B12, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, and supports favorable gut microbiome and metabolic profiles,” says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/iris-shai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iris Shai, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iris Shai, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author, adjunct professor at Harvard University, and a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our data suggest that adopting a green Mediterranean dietary pattern, prioritizing Mankai shakes or other leafy greens, walnuts, and several cups of green tea daily, while minimizing red and processed meat, may help preserve brain structure and function with age," Shai says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can you support healthy brain aging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain health is complex and requires more than just eating a certain diet, points out &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with following a nutritious eating pattern, he recommends taking medications as prescribed to manage conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity. (Leaving these unmanaged may have a negative impact on your brain, Dr. Cutler points out.) “Regular exercise is also an important factor in preserving and protecting brain health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cutler suggests doing your best to avoid alcohol and recreational drugs like marijuana, too. Finally, he recommends staying social to keep your brain sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Dr. Cutler points out that doing all of this isn’t just good for your brain health—it may help your overall health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOUXVscmE1UWFKSk40dW5TSzdxWnl3Q3k3U0F5aHRudlVfUFhINDU3Vk4yakJJd1ZBR0tKQ3c2SW5tcXp3ZllmcE1Rc3RpMVRIUVlrN0QtaHB5SkhQM2RBZUh0U2RxMGpKMk9kVHdJSFFRQ1B4MnFwSEhNZ0c3M0ZkTThOV0NqUGQwMlEzY09n</guid></item><item><title>关于素食主义的7个神话，你应该立即停止相信- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/n-t-7-myths-about-vegetarianism-you-should-stop-believing-immediately/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Crafting a kinder plate should not require myth-busting, yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear the fog fast and keep it practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are seven stubborn myths I hear all the time, and what I have learned from research and lived experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Protein is hard to get&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one hangs on like a bad chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you eat enough calories from a variety of plant foods, you will hit your protein needs with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, edamame, peas, whole grains, nuts, and seeds all bring solid protein to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even vegetables like broccoli and spinach chip in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is simple patterns; a bowl of &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/recipes/n-t-7-protein-packed-vegan-lunches-that-travel-well/"&gt;lentil chili with quinoa&lt;/a&gt;, a tofu stir fry with rice and cashews, or a chickpea wrap with tahini and greens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about “complete” proteins? Your body is smart as it pulls amino acids from your daily intake and combines them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to juggle rice and beans in the same bite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat variety over the day, and you are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) You will be tired all day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy dips do not come from plants because they come from poor planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetarian meals that balance complex carbs, protein, and fat keep blood sugar steady; oats with peanut butter and berries, soba with edamame and sesame, and Greek yogurt with walnuts and fruit if you eat dairy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These do not lead to a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fatigue shows up, it is usually about total calories, hydration, sleep, or a missing micronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitaminb12-HealthProfessional/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, and iodine are worth attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortified foods and smart supplementation can close the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people feel lighter, not slower, when they shift to fiber-rich meals that digest clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) It is too expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most budget friendly staples on Earth are vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dried beans, lentils, rice, oats, potatoes, frozen veggies, cabbage, carrots, peanut butter; these are &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/recipes/c-i-tested-the-top-5-budget-vegan-meals-one-of-them-was-shockingly-good"&gt;value kings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs rise when every meal leans on specialty faux meats or imported snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are nice to have, not must haves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch cooking a pot of dal, roasting a tray of vegetables, or prepping overnight oats cuts spending and decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way during a photo assignment that had me traveling across California on a shoestring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived on burrito bowls I built from grocery store ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beans, rice, salsa, avocado, lettuce; cheap, filling, and repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wallet did not complain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) You cannot build muscle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eathealthy.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell that to the lifters crushing pull-ups on tofu and tempeh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle responds to two main levers, progressive resistance and adequate protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians can do both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; about 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight if you are pushing hard in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hit that with tofu, tempeh, seitan, dairy if you use it, eggs if you include them, legumes, and protein-rich grains like farro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple protein shake can help if appetite lags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training quality still rules; sleep, volume, progressive overload, and consistency matter more than where the protein comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barbell does not care if your reps run on lentils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) You will miss out socially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food is culture, but culture is flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most restaurants have &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/food-and-drink/gen-ive-been-vegan-for-8-years-here-are-the-10-things-i-wish-id-known-from-the-start/"&gt;solid plant forward options&lt;/a&gt; if you scan the menu with intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pasta arrabbiata, veggie sushi, bean-based tacos, Indian thalis, Mediterranean mezze, grain bowls; even steak houses have baked potatoes and grilled veggies that can become a real meal with a salad and a side of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting or being hosted? Offer to bring a dish that can anchor the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring a big tray of roasted vegetables with chimichurri or a peanut noodle salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People eat it first, then ask for the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to defuse tension is to lead with ease, not rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say “I am good with anything plant based” and keep the focus on the company, not your plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) It is all or nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels can be helpful, they can also trap us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to align your choices with your values, health, and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If going fully vegetarian today feels like a leap, start with one meatless meal a day or pick a theme night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taco Tuesday with beans, Stir fry Friday with tofu, or breakfast every day without meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small shifts compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got serious, I built a short list of defaults I could make with my eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smoothie with oats and peanut butter, a tofu scramble with veggies and toast, and pasta with tomato sauce, olives, and a can of chickpeas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defaults remove friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the identity piece &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/all-or-nothing-thinking-examples?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;catches up&lt;/a&gt; with the habit piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) It solves every problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plant heavy diet can lower risk for a bunch of issues, and it is kinder to animals and often the planet, but it is not a magic shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still need enough calories, enough sleep, and movement that challenges your heart and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chips and soda can be vegetarian, so can a life with no sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychology matters too: If food becomes a source of constant stress, the benefits shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to treat my diet as a supportive tool, not a scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask simple questions: Does this meal help me feel clear and strong later today? Does it support the kind of person I am trying to become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-i-spent-10-years-trapped-by-self-limiting-beliefs-these-7-mindset-shifts-finally-set-me-free/"&gt;Perfection thinking is a trap&lt;/a&gt;, while progress thinking is a compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A few closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most myths survive because they contain a tiny slice of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should plan for nutrients like iron and B12, and change can feel awkward at first, but none of that adds up to a deal breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with pattern over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a small rotation of meals you enjoy and can repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep staples on hand, and pay attention to how you feel and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a vegan writer who spends a lot of time with research and a lot of time in actual kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science and the lived reality point to the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thoughtful vegetarian pattern is doable, affordable, energizing, and aligned with a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a myth tries to grab the mic, turn the volume down and let your experience lead.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, there’s another blood test that might actually out‑shine cholesterol, in flagging your risk - the high‑sensitivity CRP (hs‑CRP) test, which measures a protein that signals inflammation throughout the body. This marker can expose hazards that a plain cholesterol reading would miss. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, MD, and a Cardiologist reveals why the CRP test is so important to rule out future heart attacks...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is CRP and how does it predict heart attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRP stands for C-reactive protein, which your liver produces when there is inflammation in your body. Inflammation is your body’s natural response to injury or infection, but when it becomes chronic, it can damage your arteries, says Dr Yaranov. Damaged arteries are more likely to develop plaques that block blood flow or rupture, causing heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What are the most common tests used to diagnose heart conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high‑sensitivity CRP (hs‑CRP) blood test pinpoints trace amounts of C‑reactive protein, with immense accuracy. Research shows that individuals with elevated hs‑CRP face up to triple the chance of a heart attack, than those whose levels, even when their cholesterol numbers appear normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results underscore that inflammation, and not just cholesterol is a pivotal driver of heart‑disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Yaranov, the test outcomes are grouped as...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Low risk – anything, under 1.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Moderate risk – 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High risk: above 3.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why cholesterol alone doesn’t tell the story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cholesterol remains a piece of the heart‑disease puzzle, it certainly doesn’t explain every case. Plenty of people, with normal cholesterol levels still suffer heart attacks, while some, with high cholesterol never experience one. CRP reveals the level of inflammation that can make plaques in your arteries unstable and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaque buildup alone isn’t enough to cause a heart attack-when the plaques become inflamed, they can rupture suddenly. This rupture prompts blood clots that block arteries. An elevated CRP reading, signals the sign of lingering inflammation, and a fragile plaque - something a plain cholesterol panel could overlook. Using cholesterol tests together with the hs-CRP test, gives doctors a fuller picture of your heart health, helping guide more accurate prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How ongoing inflammation chips away at your heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inflamed arterial wall tips the balance toward a plaque rupture-the kind of event that can trigger a heart attack or stroke in an instant. In parallel, the same lingering inflammation is linked to peripheral artery disease (PAD), a condition that narrows leg arteries, bringing aching discomfort and curbing mobility. By quantifying C‑reactive protein, clinicians can spot this inflammation well before a cardiac episode emerges, opening the door to prompt targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Using the hs-CRP test alongside other markers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors however, do not pass a diagnosis, based on just CRP, they usually weigh it together with cholesterol readings, the Lp(a) variant, blood pressure, smoking status and a host of risk factors. This combination helps identify people at moderate risk who might benefit from preventive treatments, even if their cholesterol is normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple investigations have shown that tacking a high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP) measurement onto the risk‑assessment toolkit, sharpens the ability to predict who will go on to have a heart attack or a stroke. It also flags the patients most likely to reap the benefit from statin therapy, which pulls down both cholesterol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to naturally reduce CRP Levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Embrace a diet full of whole plant‑forward staples-fruits, vegetables, hearty whole grains, crunchy nuts and protein‑packed legumes, since they deliver a mix of antioxidants and anti‑inflammatory nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Keep your body moving. Even a simple 30‑minute walk each day, can help calm inflammation and bring your CRP down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Drop the cigarettes – smoking is the one of the leading causes of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Reduce stress, as persistent stress can trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medication options to reduce CRP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situations where simply tweaking one’s habits isn’t sufficient, physicians often turn to statins, which not trim cholesterol, but also exert effects that bring CRP down. Newer medications, specifically targeting inflammation are also being studied for cardiovascular protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your hs‑CRP comes back elevated, sit down with your doctor. Map out the treatment plan that fits you best. Keeping up with follow‑up labs lets you and your clinician see how things are progressing, and tweak the regimen when needed. Remember that reducing CRP is part of a comprehensive approach to reduce your overall heart attack and stroke risk. If you harbor risk factors such, as a family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure or borderline cholesterol, an hs‑CRP test might prove advantageous. It can expose a concealed threat that routine examinations often miss. Getting your hs‑CRP result often sparks the initiative to embrace heart‑healthy habits, and gives your doctor the data needed to tailor your care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgJBVV95cUxQbEk5WElhUXlmakgxTDBqLS1QMmV3d1U5WWljZkVVclIzSXI0NjMxQ0U4cDNhX2M2aTlJLS1KWnRMV2tGSDIyeVgtTUlOMGhQU3JpZ2NpLW9TVzNTa1FlS01STktDZjlxTlczU01wMlRSUkRkdVhHRnZycy13T3lDeUE0NXg5WGdhSDR2ZmFLV3R3cGRsNXRncVFmQWM4NGhJeUY3dWJLVDFtQ1liLUpETG9YT0xQQ2NoR3Q3TWNrUHZVcl9YWTdPeHd0aGVHbnhwaV84akJFRVNPZXBhSFpST19kS1VmdVAzUmZqV2pJekJrV0swSEZrdTJBZWZLQktTYTNiUEt5WHdRTXIwdzJNYUt1ZkNtT1F2WkRHU2J4Mk5ZNzJBbkJTVWJB</guid></item><item><title>“主要问题” ：在新的临床试验中，氯胺酮在治疗重度抑郁症方面的表现未能优于安慰剂- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/major-problem-ketamine-fails-to-outperform-placebo-for-treating-severe-depression-in-new-clinical-trial/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new clinical trial has found that adding repeated intravenous ketamine infusions to standard care for hospitalized patients with serious depression did not provide a significant additional benefit. The study, which compared ketamine to a psychoactive placebo, suggests that previous estimates of the drug’s effectiveness might have been influenced by patient and clinician expectations. These findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2840552" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine, originally developed as an anesthetic, has gained attention over the past two decades for its ability to produce rapid antidepressant effects in individuals who have not responded to conventional treatments. Unlike standard antidepressants that can take weeks to work, a single infusion of ketamine can sometimes lift mood within hours. A significant drawback, however, is that these benefits are often short-lived, typically fading within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led to the widespread practice of administering a series of infusions to sustain the positive effects. A central challenge in studying ketamine is its distinct psychological effects, such as feelings of dissociation or detachment from reality. When compared to an inactive placebo like a saline solution, it is very easy for participants and researchers to know who received the active drug, potentially creating strong expectancy effects that can inflate the perceived benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, the researchers designed their study to use an “active” placebo, a drug called midazolam, which is a sedative that produces noticeable effects of its own, making it a more rigorous comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ketamine has attracted a lot of interest as a rapidly-acting antidepressant but it has short-lived effects. Therefore, its usefulness is quite limited. Despite this major limitation, ketamine is increasingly being adopted as an off-label treatment for depression, especially in the USA,” said study author Declan McLoughlin, a professor at Trinity College Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that repeated ketamine infusions may have more sustained benefit. So far this has been evaluated in only a small number of trials. Another problem is that few ketamine trials have used an adequate control condition to mask the obvious dissociative effects of ketamine, e.g. altered consciousness and perceptions of oneself and one’s environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To try address some of these issues, we conducted an independent investigator-led randomized trial (KARMA-Dep 2) to evaluate antidepressant efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life during and after serial ketamine infusions when compared to a psychoactive comparison drug midazolam. Trial participants were randomized to receive up to eight infusions of either ketamine or midazolam, given over four weeks, in addition to all other aspects of usual inpatient care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, conducted at an academic hospital in Dublin, Ireland, aimed to see if adding twice-weekly ketamine infusions to the usual comprehensive care provided to inpatients could improve depression outcomes. Researchers enrolled adults who had been voluntarily admitted to the hospital for moderate to severe depression. These participants were already receiving a range of treatments, including medication, various forms of therapy, and psychoeducation programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this randomized, double-blind study, 65 participants were assigned to one of two groups. One group received intravenous ketamine infusions twice a week for up to four weeks, while the other group received intravenous midazolam on the same schedule. The doses were calculated based on body weight. The double-blind design meant that neither the patients, the clinicians rating their symptoms, nor the main investigators knew who was receiving which substance. Only the anesthesiologist administering the infusion knew the assignment, ensuring patient safety without influencing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary measure of success was the change in participants’ depression scores, assessed using a standard clinical tool called the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. This assessment was conducted at the beginning of the study and again 24 hours after the final infusion. The researchers also tracked other outcomes, such as self-reported symptoms, rates of response and remission, cognitive function, side effects, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data from 62 participants who completed the treatment phase, the study found no statistically significant difference in the main outcome between the two groups. Although patients in both groups showed improvement in their depressive symptoms during their hospital stay, the group receiving ketamine did not fare significantly better than the group receiving midazolam. The average reduction in depression scores was only slightly larger in the ketamine group, a difference that was small and could have been due to chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there were no significant advantages for ketamine on secondary measures, including self-reported depression symptoms, cognitive performance, or long-term quality of life. While the rate of remission from depression was slightly higher in the ketamine group (about 44 percent) compared to the midazolam group (30 percent), this difference was not statistically robust. The treatments were found to be generally safe, though ketamine produced more dissociative experiences during the infusion, while midazolam produced more sedation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found no significant difference between the two groups on our primary outcome measure (i.e. depression severity assessed with the commonly used Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)),” McLoughlin told PsyPost. “Nor did we find any difference between the two groups on any other secondary outcome or cost-effectiveness measure. Under rigorous clinical trial conditions, adjunctive ketamine provided no additional benefit to routine inpatient care during the initial treatment phase or the six-month follow-up period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding emerged when the researchers checked how well the “blinding” had worked. They discovered that it was not very successful. From the very first infusion, the clinicians rating patient symptoms were able to guess with high accuracy who was receiving ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the ketamine group also became quite accurate at guessing their treatment over time. This functional unblinding complicates the interpretation of the results, as the small, nonsignificant trend favoring ketamine could be explained by the psychological effect of knowing one is receiving a treatment with a powerful reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our initial hypothesis was that repeated ketamine infusions for people hospitalised with depression would improve mood outcomes,” McLoughlin said. “However, contrary to our hypothesis, we found this not to be the case. We suspect that functional unblinding (due to its obvious dissociative effects) has amplified the placebo effects of ketamine in previous trials. This is a major, often unacknowledged, problem with many recent trials in psychiatry evaluating ketamine, psychedelic, and brain stimulation therapies. Our trial highlights the importance of reporting the success, or lack thereof, of blinding in clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledged some limitations. The research was unable to recruit its planned number of participants, partly due to logistical challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This smaller sample size reduced the study’s statistical power, making it harder to detect a real, but modest, difference between the treatments if one existed. The primary limitation, however, remains the challenge of blinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this trial suggest that when tested under more rigorous conditions, the antidepressant benefit of repeated ketamine infusions may be smaller than suggested by earlier studies that used inactive placebos. The researchers propose that expectations for both patients and clinicians may play a substantial role in ketamine’s perceived effects. This highlights the need to recalibrate expectations for ketamine in clinical practice and for more robustly designed trials in psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the researchers emphasize the importance of reporting negative or null trial results to provide a balanced view of a treatment’s capabilities. They also expressed concern about a separate in the field: the promotion of ketamine as an equally effective alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scrutiny of the scientific literature shows that this includes methodologically flawed trials and invalid meta-analyses,” McLoughlin said. “We discuss this in some detail in a Comment piece &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00300-1/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;just published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, such errors have been accepted as scientific evidence and are already creeping into international clinical guidelines. There is a thus a real risk of patients and clinicians being steered towards a less effective treatment, particularly for patients with severe, sometimes life-threatening, depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2840552" target="_blank"&gt;Serial Ketamine Infusions as Adjunctive Therapy to Inpatient Care for Depression: The KARMA-Dep 2 Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Ana Jelovac, Cathal McCaffrey, Masashi Terao, Enda Shanahan, Emma Whooley, Kelly McDonagh, Sarah McDonogh, Orlaith Loughran, Ellie Shackleton, Anna Igoe, Sarah Thompson, Enas Mohamed, Duyen Nguyen, Ciaran O’Neill, Cathal Walsh, and Declan M.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center made the discovery while studying the potential of mRNA-based therapies to activate the immune system against cancer. Their results build on more than a decade of work exploring how messenger RNA could be used to "wake up" the body's natural defenses. The findings also move the field closer to the idea of a universal cancer vaccine that could enhance the effects of existing immunotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of more than 1,000 patient records at MD Anderson provided the data behind the observation. Although the results are preliminary, researchers are now designing a randomized clinical trial to confirm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Extraordinary Implications" for Cancer Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The implications are extraordinary -- this could revolutionize the entire field of oncologic care," said co-senior author Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist and the Stop Children's Cancer/Bonnie R. Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research. "We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilize and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Coller, Ph.D., an mRNA expert and professor at Johns Hopkins University, noted that this discovery highlights another way Operation Warp Speed (the federal initiative that accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development) continues to benefit Americans in "unique and unexpected ways."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results from this study demonstrate how powerful mRNA medicines truly are and that they are revolutionizing our treatment of cancer," Coller said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on Years of mRNA Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published on October 22 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the research extends Sayour's eight years of work combining lipid nanoparticles with mRNA technology. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is present in all cells and delivers the instructions for making proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in July, Sayour's lab reported a surprising finding: to trigger a strong immune attack on tumors, it was not necessary to target a specific protein within the cancer. Simply stimulating the immune system, similar to how it responds to a virus, could be enough to generate an antitumor effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lab experiments, Sayour's team combined their experimental "nonspecific" mRNA vaccine with a class of anticancer drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Together, the combination produced a powerful immune response in mice. The experimental vaccine itself was not directed at the COVID spike protein or any other specific molecule -- it used the same underlying technology as COVID vaccines but worked more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting COVID Vaccines and Cancer Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That discovery, years in the making, sparked a question from former lab member and first author Adam Grippin, M.D., Ph.D., who trained at UF's Preston A. Wells Center for Brain Tumor Therapy and now works at MD Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine work like the nonspecific vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, the research team analyzed existing data from patients with Stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma treated at MD Anderson from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was that receiving a COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy drugs was associated with living longer by a significant amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic difference, Sayour said, was in patients not expected to have a strong immune response, based on their tumors' molecular makeup and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any observational study, the findings require confirmation from a prospective and randomized clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the discovery is pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although not yet proven to be causal, this is the type of treatment benefit that we strive for and hope to see with therapeutic interventions -- but rarely do," said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., Grippin's doctoral mentor and director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. "I think the urgency and importance of doing the confirmatory work can't be overstated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the COVID Vaccine May Enhance Immunotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lung and skin cancers, doctors commonly engage the immune system with drugs designed to "release the brakes" and recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. In advanced disease stages, however, most patients don't respond well and often have exhausted other treatment options like radiation, surgery and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study involved records of 180 advanced lung cancer patients who received a COVID vaccine within a 100-day period before or after starting immunotherapy drugs and 704 treated with the same drugs who did not receive the vaccine. Getting the vaccine was associated with a near doubling of median survival, from 20.6 months to 37.3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the metastatic melanoma patients, 43 received a vaccine within 100 days of initiating immunotherapy, while 167 patients did not receive a vaccine. With the vaccine, median survival increased from 26.7 months to a range of 30 to 40 months; at the time the data were collected, some patients were still alive, meaning the vaccine effect could be even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving non-mRNA pneumonia or flu vaccines resulted in no changes in longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Tests Support Human Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reinforce their observations, UF scientists conducted experiments in mice combining immunotherapy drugs with an mRNA vaccine specifically targeting the COVID spike protein. The results showed that this pairing could transform tumors that had previously resisted treatment into ones that responded, effectively stopping tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the mechanisms for how this works is when you give an mRNA vaccine, that acts as a flare that starts moving all of these immune cells from bad areas like the tumor to good areas like the lymph nodes," Sayour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to launch a large clinical trial through the UF-led OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, a consortium of hospitals, health centers and clinics in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, California and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of our key motivations at OneFlorida is to move discoveries from academic settings out into the real world and the places where patients get care," said Betsy Shenkman, Ph.D., who leads the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the new findings unlock numerous possibilities, and the researchers said an even better nonspecific universal vaccine could be designed. For patients with advanced cancers, the increased survival from such a universal vaccine could provide a priceless benefit: more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If this can double what we're achieving currently, or even incrementally -- 5%, 10% -- that means a lot to those patients, especially if this can be leveraged across different cancers for different patients," said Sayour, an investigator with UF's McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and multiple foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sayour, Grippin and Mitchell hold patents related to UF-developed mRNA vaccines that are licensed by iOncologi Inc., a biotech company born as a "spinout" from UF in which Mitchell holds interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kelli Gehrke, 36, had been in cardiac arrest for seven minutes when a mobile team of doctors and specialists flown in from Harborview Medical Center connected her to a life-saving machine that bypassed her failing heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three days earlier, Kelli Gehrke had traveled with her husband Chris Gehrke from their home in Lacey, Washington, to Madigan Army Medical Center in Fort Lewis for the birth of their third child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things had not gone according to plan. After an emergency C-section, Kelli Gehrke suffered a rare amniotic fluid embolism, causing amniotic fluid from the womb to enter her bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the birth and the complications that followed, Kelli Gehrke lost the equivalent of six people’s worth of blood. Chris Gehrke said doctors told him his wife was losing so much blood, Madigan used everything it had on hand and still needed emergency donations from 72 people to save her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when a Madigan doctor trained in its use suggested the hospital seek out Harborview’s mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to help Kelli Gehrke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They life-flighted the ECMO team out there and when they arrived, her heart rate, everything was super low,” Chris Gehrke said. “As they set up the machine, she went into cardiac arrest.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One team was giving his wife CPR while another was attaching her to the ECMO, a process called cannulation that involves inserting large tubes into major blood vessels in the neck, groin, or chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When they put the ECMO into her, she had already passed away,” Gehrke said. “When they started the machine, it actually kicked her right up to life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/amid-funding-cuts-and-public-health-battles-nih-issues-autism-research-grants" target="_blank"&gt;Amid funding cuts and public health battles, NIH issues autism research grants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECMO machines have been around for more than 50 years. For much of that time, they were used primarily to help patients survive while they waited for an organ transplant. But in the last 10-15 years, and especially since Covid, they are being used as a last-ditch effort to stabilize patients whose lungs or hearts are failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UW Medical Centers at Montlake and Harborview have been on the forefront of this expansion. The two hospitals went from having three ECMO machines in 2012 to 13 in 2025. Last year, they used the machines on 130 patients total, 65 of whom survived.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UW Medicine also has mobile ECMO teams, like the one that helped Kelli Gehrke, that can be deployed throughout the Pacific Northwest for patients who are too medically unstable to transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 50% of patients who are put on an ECMO survive. But that coin-toss survival rate is deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with lung failure, the survival rate is closer to 70%. The survival rate for people like Kelli Gehrke who are in cardiac arrest is closer to 30%. But the survival rate without the machine for those patients is nearly zero, said Dr. John Scott, a trauma surgeon at the UW Medicine Department of Surgery and the medical director of Harborview’s ECMO program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients are not statistics,” Scott said. “For that patient who is clearly on the verge of death, and you put them on [an] ECMO, and they walk out of the hospital, that changes your whole career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Buying time&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the key medical takeaways from the pandemic was the limitations of widely available emergency measures to successfully treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For thousands of Covid patients, the only immediate option was intubation, but that carries risks of infection and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's basically a plastic tube highway for bacteria to enter the lungs and get them re-infected,” said Dr. Jenelle Badulak, associate director of the UW Medicine ECMO program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, hospitals and doctors became experts in treating lung failure, and they recognized the value of having ECMO machines to bypass the lungs as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of ECMO machines — one that bypasses the lungs only and oxygenates the blood while the patient’s heart continues to pump and a second machine that takes over both heart and lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Covid was a crash course in treating ARDS,” Scott said. “A lot of hospitals became a respiratory failure unit overnight. As a result, when we get these calls, so many places have been doing all the hard work. They’ve been doing all the right things, and the patients just aren’t responding.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

    


&lt;/figure&gt;




  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the case with 20-year-old Ethan Noack, a junior studying computer engineering at the University of Washington in Tacoma. Noack started having trouble breathing several days after he had surgery to repair torn ligaments in his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother Elaine Martins Noack took him to the emergency room where X-rays showed damage to his lungs that was inconsistent with a healthy teenager with no history of respiratory disease. Ethan Noack was moved to Tacoma General Hospital, but his lungs kept getting worse and his doctors couldn’t figure out why. After a week, he was intubated and airlifted to Harborview, where he was put on a lung-bypassing ECMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after his arrival in Seattle, one of the Harborview residents forwarded an article to Martins Noack about a rare reaction to the antibiotic Bactrim, a drug that her son had been on before and after his wrist surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I read the article, I was first terrified because that child has suffered so much,” she said. “There was something in me that told me that’s why he was sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When doctors biopsied Noack’s lungs, they confirmed that he was one of only a few dozen verified cases of people who suffered severe ARDS after taking Bactrim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scott said an ECMO buys time for medical staff to evaluate and diagnose challenging cases like Noack’s and gives the body time to do what it does best — heal itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ECMO doesn't cure the lungs,” he said. “ECMO rests the lungs and makes sure the body gets the oxygen it needs while the lungs can recover on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Air hunger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noack, who was on an ECMO for more than a month, was determined to become Harborview’s first patient to walk while hooked up to the machine. He said his primary inspiration was the music of Kendrick Lamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff created a playlist to help get Noack motivated. His mother said it took 10 people to get him walking. They turned the music up extra loud so it wasn’t drowned out by all the beeping and humming of the machines that were keeping Noack alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each day was a different song, and each day he would walk a little more,” Martins Noack said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to these small triumphs, her son also endured anxiety, depression, and fear. One of the most challenging things about being awake on ECMO is a side effect called “air hunger,” an intense feeling of suffocation because the patient is awake but not breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Badulak said rehab psychologists work with ECMO patients, especially during the first few days, to help them overcome the panic of not being able to fill their lungs with air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Martins Noack, the memory of her son struggling to breathe was particularly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He would lose control of his body and believe that he was dying even though I was telling him, ‘You’re not dying. You’re not drowning,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trauma of what her son has been through has shaken Martins Noack's confidence, even now that he is back home and recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time she gets in a car, she worries about getting in an accident, she said. When she takes Ethan for a checkup, she thinks, “What if I get in a wreck and he doesn’t have enough oxygen?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just the fragility of existence is something I think will change anyone,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Road to recovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every successful use of an ECMO is the story of a life saved. But many families who come out on the other side may find their lives turned upside down as they struggle to recover from an emergency that almost killed them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kelli Gehrke is relearning to walk. She now has a drop foot from where the ECMO was inserted near her groin. Her kidneys were damaged during her illness. She gets dialysis eight hours a week and might need a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan Noack remains on oxygen at his home in Lake Tapps, Washington. Doctors determined, at the last possible minute, that he does not require a lung transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remain about whether scar tissue will develop around the small holes in his lungs, which could prevent him from a full recovery and restrict him from eventually doing the things he loves, like playing basketball with his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The financial toll&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of an ECMO treatment at UW Medicine is about $13,000 a day, according to spokesperson Susan Gregg. While reimbursement levels vary depending on the patient’s health insurance, they also face the challenge of making ends meet during extended recoveries that can last months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/trump-might-shut-down-uw-s-primate-research-center-should-he" target="_blank"&gt;Trump might shut down UW’s Primate Research Center.

During his mother’s illness, he bonded with his father’s chest, the only thing that calms him. But at least he’s healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's good,” Kelli Gehrke said. “I'm the one that took the hit, but I'll take it as long as he's OK.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As for Ethan Noack, he’s happy to be back home with his dogs — Gigi, a shiatsu, Bruno, a corgi, and Sebastian or Seba, the wiener dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends of the &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-ethans-critical-care" target="_blank"&gt;Noack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kellis-path-to-recovery-needs-your-help" target="_blank"&gt;Gehrke&lt;/a&gt; families have set up GoFundMe pages to help cover the costs of their ongoing health crises and recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making the call&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Scott and Badulak are part of a specialized medical team that decides whether patients would benefit from an ECMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group considers multiple factors in making what is often a life-or-death decision. Do the benefits of the ECMO outweigh the risks? Is the patient’s illness related to their lungs or heart or are they in danger because of something else, such as liver failure, which an ECMO can’t help? What’s the likelihood the person would survive attachment to an ECMO? What would their quality of life be if they did survive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/supreme-court-allows-nih-to-stop-making-nearly-800m-in-research-grants-for-now" target="_blank"&gt;Supreme Court allows NIH to stop making nearly $800M in research grants for now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program’s advancement combined with more available machines has led UW Medicine to approve more ECMO patients – people they wouldn’t have in previous years, Badulak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefit of us being a high-volume platinum center is that we just have so much experience now that we get braver and braver with our patient selection,” she said. “Patients are surviving that maybe we thought wouldn't. That helps embolden us to continue pushing boundaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Badulak said the challenge now is to get the word out to rural hospitals that have patients who might survive if they had access to a mobile ECMO team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Call us if you have someone who is dying from heart or lung failure, because we may be able to come out and put them on ECMO and save them,” she said. “Not everybody is a candidate for this, but we really want to hear from everybody, because each patient is unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
