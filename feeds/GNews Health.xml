By 2023, that figure increased to 0.5 percent—a rise of over 66 percent in just four years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means that one in five heart attack patients are now younger than 40. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some experts have pointed to the Covid virus as a possible cause due to the strain it puts on the heart and its link to blood flow issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conspiracy theorists have also linked the rise to the Covid vaccines, though there is no evidence linking the shots to widespread heart attacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, a top cardiologist has revealed to DailyMail.com four factors he blames, based on the literature and his experience in the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai in New York, said there had been a notable shift in prescription drug use among young people which could be playing a role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart attacks among 18- to 44-year-olds increased 66 percent between 2019 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Prescription drug abuse &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall and Ritalin prescriptions surged by 14 percent during the pandemic, driven largely by the rapid rise of telehealth platforms and relaxed regulations that made it easier to obtain prescriptions through virtual consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2019 and 2022, roughly 5.9 million new stimulant scripts were written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increase was especially pronounced among young adults aged 20 to 39, who experienced a 30 percent rise in Schedule II stimulant prescriptions during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr. Levine, this dramatic spike in usage 'undoubtedly played a role' in the rise in heart attacks observed within this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall - a stimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - can increase the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular events when misused, as noted by the American College of Cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at a major university hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medication, which is taken by over 16million adults in the US, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13835837/Common-prescription-drug-taken-tens-millions-linked-five-fold-increase-mental-breakdown.html"&gt;increases attention and decreases hyperactivity &lt;/a&gt;in ADHD patients by increasing levels of dopamine (described as the feel-good hormone) in the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite being a commonly prescribed treatment, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency classifies Adderall as a Schedule II drug, the same status as cocaine - meaning they both have a high potential to be abused. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The feeling of euphoria the medication provides can lead to tolerance or dependence - both of which can prompt a patient to take higher doses of Adderall to achieve its effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can cause an addiction to the medication over time. Some common signs of Adderall abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, sweating, restlessness and dilated pupils. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At times, the medication can also constrict blood vessels and hamper blood flow which in turn, can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and increase chances of having an attack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excessive intake of Adderall can increase the risks of having a stroke or a heart attack as it can increase the overall heart rate and blood pressure higher than the baseline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the organ and obstruct blood flow to the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition where the wall of a coronary artery tears, potentially leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is commonly seen in young woman and most times, after they give birth, Dr Levine told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of the condition remains unknown, hormonal fluctuations, inflammation and possible underlying conditions like fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal growth of tissue within the walls of medium and large arteries) are suspected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCAD is becoming more prevalent, especially among younger adults and women for reasons still being understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past 25 years, studies have shown a clear rise in SCAD cases, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the heart and obstruct blood flow to the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This interruption of blood supply can deprive the heart muscles of oxygen and other essential nutrients, which can lead to damage and a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said it is essential that experts find 'more sensitive methods' to detect SCAD in young people to avoid cases of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Crime-related stress &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can cause psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress can have a major impact on health - from affecting sleep to raising blood pressure, not getting enough shut eye can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while work-related stress has often been the focus, Dr Levine told DailyMail.com that stress from crime may be a major contributor to early heart attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologist told DailyMail.com 'society has fallen apart over a number of years with fear of crime in so many [people]', which can lead to stress in the body and affect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the 2024 FBI crime report suggests a decrease in violent crimes including murder, homicide and car jackings, a study by Statista suggests 64 percent of Americans feel like there is more crime now in the country now than in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can have a psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to stress responses ranging from anxiety and fear to more long-term conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While stress itself cannot directly cause a heart attack, it can significantly contribute to the risk by increasing blood pressure and affecting blood flow, which can pose a risk for heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Obesity &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 100 million or 40.3 percent of Americans are suffering from obesity across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies estimate over 370,000 deaths per year in the US are linked to excessive body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity can raise cholesterol and blood pressure and lead to Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c4dad930-1eeb-11f0-b6a2-a344cd87ec8b" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; - all of which increase risks for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher need more blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to their bodies, which forces the heart to beat with more pressure to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extra weight also gives the body volume, which creates more resistance for the heart to overcome as it pumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The larger volume and increased resistance can result in the heart having to work much harder almost all the time. Since the organ is made of only muscle, the increased workload can cause pressure in the walls and increase blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is one of the most &lt;span&gt;common causes of heart attack and is the leading cause of death in obese individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, a group of researchers from across the globe found performing at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14559961/weekend-warriors-exercise-two-days-cancer.html"&gt;over the span of two days&lt;/a&gt; had similar health benefits as to working out the entire week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who only exercised on two days had a 32 percent lower risk of death from all causes, a 31 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 21 percent lower risk of dying from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends adults engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video with Edwards that has just come to light, CHD once again uses the situation to disparage MMR vaccines. Someone off camera asks Edwards if he had never had measles before, to which he replies that he had gotten an MMR vaccine as a kid, though he didn't know if he had gotten one or the recommended two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't work then, does it?" the off-camera person asks, referring to the MMR vaccine. "No, apparently not, " Edwards replies. "Just wear[s] off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Edwards had a breakthrough infection, which is rare, but it does occur. They're more common in people who have only gotten one dose, which is possibly the case for Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single dose of MMR is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses are 97 percent effective. In either case, the protection is considered lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While up to 97 percent effectiveness is extremely protective, some people do not mount protective responses and are still vulnerable to an infection upon exposure. However, their illnesses will likely be milder than if they had not been vaccinated. In the video, Edwards described his illness as a "mild case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data on the outbreak demonstrates the effectiveness of vaccination. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;As of April 18&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials have identified 597 measles cases, leading to 62 hospitalizations and two deaths in school-aged, unvaccinated children with no underlying medical conditions. Most of the cases have been in unvaccinated children. Of the 597 cases, 12 (2 percent) had received two MMR doses previously, and 10 (1.6 percent) had received one dose. The remaining 99 percent of cases are either unvaccinated or have no record of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the video, Edwards tells CHD he's "doing what any doctor should be doing."&lt;/p&gt;

However, they’re far from the only nutrient to consider. Saturated fat and sodium’s roles in blood sugar may not be as obvious, but they’re just as important for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 34.1 million people in the United States have diabetes. And while there isn’t a universal eating plan for managing this condition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends focusing on an overall balanced eating pattern, including limiting foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium. Here, dietitians explain why paying attention to saturated fat and sodium is important for managing blood sugar levels, along with other strategies for maintaining a balanced, diabetes-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention To Saturated Fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Saturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; are solid at room temperature. They’re typically found in animal-based foods, like cheese, butter, milk and meat, though they’re also found in plant-based oils, including coconut oil. While there’s some debate about whether all saturated fat is harmful, high intake of saturated fat has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease, a condition that people with diabetes are already at a higher risk for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to heart health, too much saturated fat may affect blood sugar levels by increasing the risk of insulin resistance, making it harder for glucose to move out of the bloodstream and into cells.&lt;a href="https://nutritiouslysimple.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle medicine dietitian, diabetes educator and founder at Nutritiously Simple, says, “Saturated fat, especially from meat and dairy, can increase insulin resistance, making it harder to manage glucose levels. Fat does not raise blood glucose directly the way carbohydrates do, but it can affect blood glucose in terms of digestion of food, insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturated fat also indirectly affects blood sugar levels thanks to its effects on insulin action. &lt;a href="https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, says, “Dietary fat profoundly impacts insulin action over time. In the short term, the initial insulin response is often slower and lower, but the total insulin needed may still be significant, depending on the fat type and amount.” This interaction is particularly important for people who take insulin to manage their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin recommends limiting saturated fat to 10% or less of daily calories. “For somebody consuming 1500 calories, that would be about 16 grams or less a day. Look at the nutrition facts label, and aim for saturated fat as close to zero as possible,” she says. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean you should limit all fat. Instead, opt for unsaturated fats when possible, including plant-based, whole-food sources like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. Fatty fish, like salmon, are also beneficial thanks to their rich concentration of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001058/best-healthy-fats-for-diabetes-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention to Sodium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you have other complications, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, people with diabetes are encouraged to limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day, which is the same guideline for healthy adults. While exceeding this amount won’t directly cause your blood sugar levels to spike, it can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), which is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the link between sodium and blood sugar levels. However, one study found that treatments focused on balancing sodium levels were linked with better recovery and survival odds in people hospitalized with hyperglycemia. To help prevent hypertension, focus on eating more minimally processed, low-sodium foods, especially ones that are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in potassium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is that foods high in sodium—like fast food, packaged snacks and fried foods—also tend to be high in saturated fat and low in fiber. “Highly processed, salty foods often contain refined carbs, and additives that [may] increase systemic inflammation and worsen insulin resistance. Choosing lower-sodium, whole food options supports both stable blood sugar and reduced inflammation,” says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Strategies to Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many factors affect blood sugar management, including overall eating patterns, exercise habits, sleep and stress management. Here are some tips for keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move Your Body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood sugar levels, including lowering hemoglobin A1C. Physical activity makes cells more sensitive to insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels up to 24 hours after activity. Find a type of activity you enjoy and commit to it. Start small and build your way up gradually. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk with your doctor first. Because exercise can lower blood sugar levels, your medication regimen may need to be adjusted to prevent your levels from dropping too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is an unavoidable, and sometimes necessary, part of life. However, being chronically stressed can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain. “Stress can have long-lasting glucose-raising effects,” says Plunkett. She adds that developing tools to help manage stress is key for supporting metabolic and mental health. “Focusing on deep breathing, sitting quietly device-free, changing your environment (even for a few minutes) or going for a walk can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood glucose and support overall metabolism,” says Plunkett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Work With a Professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for years, working with a diabetes professional is one of the best ways to help manage blood sugar levels. Working one-on-one with a professional can ensure that your treatment plan is tailored to your needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eat More Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber-rich foods are naturally low in fat and contribute to insulin sensitivity, particularly by decreasing inflammation. Higher fiber diets are well known for decreasing a person's risk of developing metabolic disease and lowering hemoglobin A1C levels (three-month average of blood sugar),” says Plunkett. Adding fiber to your meal can also help slow the absorption of sugar, minimizing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber is beneficial for weight loss and supports brain, gut and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans fall short of their daily fiber needs, which are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Luckily, adding more fiber to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. “Swap meat for legumes, like lentils, chickpeas or edamame. They are a great source of protein and fiber. This combination can assist in reducing inflammation, post-meal blood sugar spikes and improve gut health and insulin sensitivity,” says Levin. In addition to legumes, she recommends eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Specifically, Levin says that she encourages her clients to eat 30 different plant-based foods throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Factors To Consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, smoking habits and medication regimens are additional factors to consider when managing blood sugar levels. Technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, can also be helpful for tracking blood sugar levels and adjusting your treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to managing diabetes. Nutrients like fat, sodium and fiber also play a key role in keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Eating an overall balanced diet, with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods like vegetables and legumes, can help limit your intake of saturated fat and sodium while also increasing your intake of fiber and other essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for a long time, there are things you can do to manage your blood sugar. Focus on one change at a time and don’t hesitate to ask for help. To help make getting the help you need more affordable, consider reaching out to your insurance provider.

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most frequently asked questions people with diabetes have is, “What can I eat?” Carbohydrates are often the primary focus, as they have the greatest effect on blood sugar levels. However, they’re far from the only nutrient to consider. Saturated fat and sodium’s roles in blood sugar may not be as obvious, but they’re just as important for diabetes management. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Approximately 34.1 million people in the United States have diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while there isn’t a universal eating plan for managing this condition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends focusing on an overall balanced eating pattern, including limiting foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here, dietitians explain why paying attention to saturated fat and sodium is important for managing blood sugar levels, along with other strategies for maintaining a balanced, diabetes-friendly diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-you-should-pay-attention-to-saturated-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why You Should Pay Attention To Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; are solid at room temperature. They’re typically found in animal-based foods, like cheese, butter, milk and meat, though they’re also found in plant-based oils, including coconut oil. While there’s some debate about whether all saturated fat is harmful, high intake of saturated fat has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease, a condition that people with diabetes are already at a higher risk for.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to heart health, too much saturated fat may affect blood sugar levels by increasing the risk of insulin resistance, making it harder for glucose to move out of the bloodstream and into cells.&lt;a href="http://www.nutritiouslysimple.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle medicine dietitian, diabetes educator and founder at Nutritiously Simple, says, “Saturated fat, especially from meat and dairy, can increase insulin resistance, making it harder to manage glucose levels. Fat does not raise blood glucose directly the way carbohydrates do, but it can affect blood glucose in terms of digestion of food, insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Saturated fat also indirectly affects blood sugar levels thanks to its effects on insulin action. &lt;a href="https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, says, “Dietary fat profoundly impacts insulin action over time. In the short term, the initial insulin response is often slower and lower, but the total insulin needed may still be significant, depending on the fat type and amount.” This interaction is particularly important for people who take insulin to manage their condition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Levin recommends limiting saturated fat to 10% or less of daily calories. “For somebody consuming 1500 calories, that would be about 16 grams or less a day. Look at the nutrition facts label, and aim for saturated fat as close to zero as possible,” she says. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean you should limit all fat. Instead, opt for unsaturated fats when possible, including plant-based, whole-food sources like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. Fatty fish, like salmon, are also beneficial thanks to their rich concentration of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce chronic inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-you-should-pay-attention-to-sodium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why You Should Pay Attention to Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unless you have other complications, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, people with diabetes are encouraged to limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day, which is the same guideline for healthy adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While exceeding this amount won’t directly cause your blood sugar levels to spike, it can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), which is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research is needed to understand the link between sodium and blood sugar levels. However, one study found that treatments focused on balancing sodium levels were linked with better recovery and survival odds in people hospitalized with hyperglycemia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help prevent hypertension, focus on eating more minimally processed, low-sodium foods, especially ones that are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in potassium&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another aspect to consider is that foods high in sodium—like fast food, packaged snacks and fried foods—also tend to be high in saturated fat and low in fiber. “Highly processed, salty foods often contain refined carbs, and additives that [may] increase systemic inflammation and worsen insulin resistance. Choosing lower-sodium, whole food options supports both stable blood sugar and reduced inflammation,” says Levin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors affect blood sugar management, including overall eating patterns, exercise habits, sleep and stress management. Here are some tips for keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Move Your Body &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood sugar levels, including lowering hemoglobin A1C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Physical activity makes cells more sensitive to insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels up to 24 hours after activity. Find a type of activity you enjoy and commit to it. Start small and build your way up gradually. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk with your doctor first. Because exercise can lower blood sugar levels, your medication regimen may need to be adjusted to prevent your levels from dropping too low. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Manage Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is an unavoidable, and sometimes necessary, part of life. However, being chronically stressed can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Stress can have long-lasting glucose-raising effects,” says Plunkett. She adds that developing tools to help manage stress is key for supporting metabolic and mental health. “Focusing on deep breathing, sitting quietly device-free, changing your environment (even for a few minutes) or going for a walk can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood glucose and support overall metabolism,” says Plunkett.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Work With a Professional &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for years, working with a diabetes professional is one of the best ways to help manage blood sugar levels. Working one-on-one with a professional can ensure that your treatment plan is tailored to your needs and lifestyle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat More Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber-rich foods are naturally low in fat and contribute to insulin sensitivity, particularly by decreasing inflammation. Higher fiber diets are well known for decreasing a person's risk of developing metabolic disease and lowering hemoglobin A1C levels (three-month average of blood sugar),” says Plunkett. Adding fiber to your meal can also help slow the absorption of sugar, minimizing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber is beneficial for weight loss and supports brain, gut and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most Americans fall short of their daily fiber needs, which are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, adding more fiber to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. “Swap meat for legumes, like lentils, chickpeas or edamame. They are a great source of protein and fiber. This combination can assist in reducing inflammation, post-meal blood sugar spikes and improve gut health and insulin sensitivity,” says Levin.

Fast food chains are often just tasty indulgences offering a convenient way to grab a meal. But when the craving strikes and you want to get your hands on a greasy burger or handful of fries, sometimes you may want to strike a bit of a balance, health-wise, with your order. That's when it comes in handy to know which chains are sizzling up exactly what you're looking for when it comes to nutrition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a 2024 study conducted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplushcare.com%2Fblog%2Fmost-least-healthy-items-fast-food%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa64542959%2Fmost-unhealthy-fast-food-burger-america%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PlushCare;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;PlushCare&lt;/a&gt;, some fast food restaurants are much more unhealthy than others. Particularly Five Guys, which scored the number one spot in a ranking of the unhealthiest cheeseburgers, with a 50-point "unhealthiness score." Five Guys fries also weighed in as the unhealthiest, with 28 points on the score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whataburger, Smash Burger, and Carl's Jr. trailed behind in the ranking. Five Guys, however, had 73 percent more saturated fat than any other fast food cheeseburger on the list.

"That might mean avoiding fast food altogether, but it can be as simple as making an informed decision about which &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a61039585/these-are-the-top-10-fast-food-chains-in-america/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food chains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt; to visit and which of their products to choose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burger King and McDonald's, somewhat shockingly, tied for second-lowest unhealthiness scores at just 18 points. Cheeseburgers from those chains pack a quarter of the saturated fat (a.k.a what leads to heart disease risk and weight gain) compared to a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19695099/best-burger-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cheeseburger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt; at Five Guys, and less than half of a Wendy's burger.

Aliota is studying the virus in two of the nation’s epicenters over the course of the five-year grant: Minnesota and New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQajJvQUVJM1VFYTlrWUNZbGNlRzBGX0Z5M0VjSlJJVVljdkktd3NvUmJaTklucjRDMUpiSUlnWTlTRHhsbDFOUUYxRDQzNW4tT2hJOFJqSU1NQVpCX2wtWW1JWHBOTjVSQW1TUXlTblk0bU9jeGxMX2JBTlotUUNjdkpyNmo2Ty1LUE1raWY0QTdTQmluQ0VCblRFNlk5bVM2VVVaMkFtMmpqYklwQVdr</guid></item><item><title>六种“沉默”的癌症在男性和女性中悄然涌现......及其微妙的症状-每日邮报 | The six 'silent' cancers quietly surging in men and women... and their subtle symptoms - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQbXpCUHpvRHduVG43U3JXbWFHcnZMejlIcWdiLWt2dkE4Mjg2NG5pekQ1SjZaMVhzMC1JVkM1eGh0dEZ4NGN3Ukt1VjRRUVZxYjVTT001NzNZdHRzZHZ4dmptc2RaQlVOVTZ2UEFpUDJRdThpN2NZdjFkVmJOS2lNSlV3N3pDU2ZNX2padmNPckRmQ05XRnZDemdKcDVXS3NPTWFNUVBZWkNuTHNMT05tejRBMHFnQ0540gG-AUFVX3lxTE9YbTNLMldKaTNXM0NGRlBwTjNyYVpOajhNLXppTWhLaERsOU80ZjlkdW0tLTNaX0RxV1VWMm4zT25USlZEZ3JqUEhCN3JyZFo3dzdYR0NuZU1QYmdUVVBtd3AwdGhYNk9tRmhoaUFHdEN2RmY0UUtEM0s3MEkxZjZJeGFQcm1nQXZFeXBmanlMVTFuVThXaFhiS3NSWFUwVEJRbFo4OURvT0pWSnVnOEZSeTZuZUhMZmNJaDFXZmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths caused by most forms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-e7347ae0-1edc-11f0-b170-9f0e11004cf7"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; are falling across the US, according to a major annual report, but still, there are several types of the disease that continue to have rising fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new report from the NIH and American Heart Association (AHA) shows overall cancer deaths have declined steadily over the past 20 years — even during the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-aa821f00-1edf-11f0-a2fc-232d4df57398" class=""&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic — with annual decreases of 1.7 percent for men and 1.3 percent for women between 2018 and 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13735093/Cancer-deaths-men-predicted-surge-2050-global-study-reveals-rise-younger-people-disease.html"&gt;cancer rates in men&lt;/a&gt; remained steady from 2013 to 2021 (not counting the unusual year of 2020), but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14296699/american-doctors-detect-alarming-shift-cancer-patients.html"&gt;for women&lt;/a&gt;, rates slowly increased by about 0.3 percent each year from 2003 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates in children have steadily declined, and rates among teens and young adults have also dropped—though progress has recently slowed. Advances in treatment, early detection, and supportive care have played a big role in improving survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But deaths from melanoma and other skin cancers, as well as those of the mouth and pharynx, bones and joints, pancreas, uterus, and liver, are increasing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say several factors are to blame, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13404251/Obesity-linked-cancers-major-study.html"&gt;high rates of obesity&lt;/a&gt;, which drives pancreatic, uterine, and liver cancer-causing inflammation, hormone imbalances, and delayed or difficult diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An aging population also fuels cancers, such as those of the bones, pancreas, and liver, since older cells have had more time to accumulate DNA damage — and weaker immune systems make it harder to fight disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lack of access to early detection tools affects nearly all cancers, especially oral and skin cancers, which can often go unnoticed or misdiagnosed until later stages when treatment is more difficult, contributing to higher mortality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Increased deaths from liver, pancreas, uterine, bone, oral, and skin cancers are driven by high obesity rates, viral infections, an aging population, and limited access to early detection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the cancers with rising rates, symptoms often begin subtly, not prompting someone to seek medical care right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma, a serious skin cancer, often appears as a new or changing mole that may itch, bleed, or fail to fade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancers of the mouth and throat can cause persistent sores, swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, or unusual lumps. Bone and joint cancers frequently lead to worsening pain (especially at night), swelling, or unexpected fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer may cause upper abdominal pain, jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and eyes), and digestive issues. Liver and bile duct cancers typically cause jaundice, right-sided abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uterine cancer often reveals itself through abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these symptoms can have other causes, persistent or worsening signs warrant immediate medical attention for proper evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35833"&gt;Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;tracks new cancer cases, deaths, and trends in the US, using data from the NIH, CDC, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers drew from CDC programs and US Census data to account for demographic shifts and examined the impact of Covid, focusing on how the pandemic disrupted early detection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the death rates fell overall, certain cancers showed increases in mortality rates from 2018 to 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="14632737" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14632737/six-silent-cancers-quietly-surging-men-women-subtle-symptoms.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They analyzed monthly trends in eight cancers—mainly those typically caught through screenings or routine care—across multiple registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the state level, the researchers looked at how cancer rates where linked to how different states handled the pandemic with three specific factors: how strict the state’s Covid restrictions were, how many people died from Covid, and how much mammogram use changed from 2018 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States with more stringent Covid policies – like masking and school closures – experienced larger declines in cancer incidence, particularly for cancers like female breast, thyroid, and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These differences were minimal, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there was some correlation between the severity of Covid restrictions and cancer incidence declines, this geographic component did not fully explain the decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other factors like Covid death rates and changes in mammography utilization were also considered, but did not show a significant impact on the decline at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report showed death rates in men increased among cancers of the pancreas (0.3 percent per year), bones and joints (1.8 percent), oral cavity and pharynx (2.1 percent), and non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 percent) from 2018 to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This set of four US maps shows how the Covid pandemic may have affected cancer care. The first map shows where cancer diagnoses dropped the most from 2019 to 2020. The second shows how strict Covid policies were in each state. The third highlights areas with the highest Covid death rates. The fourth shows where breast cancer screenings (mammograms) declined the most between 2018 and 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women, death rates increased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (up 1.1 percent), corpus and uterus (1.1 percent), liver and intrahepatic bile duct (0.7 percent), and pancreas (0.2 percent) during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Progress in reducing cancer deaths overall is largely the result of declines in both incidence and death rates for lung cancer and several other smoking-related cancers, according to the NIH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diagnoses and deaths from lung cancer, for example, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-8620971/Lung-cancer-deaths-falling-nearly-5-year-2001-thanks-better-treatment.html"&gt;have declined&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women over the past 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report does not provide a specific explanation for why death rates for certain cancers rose, but &lt;span&gt;are likely linked to a combination of factors such as delays in early detection, limited advances in treatment, or the aggressive nature of these cancers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, tobacco use is a known contributor to oral cancer, while diet and obesity are known risk factors for cancers of all types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2001 to 2022, the cancer death rate among children from newborn to 14 dropped by 1.5 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Death rates for adolescents and young adults also declined until recently, when the decline slowed and stabilized, the NIH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood cancer incidence rate began to decrease by 0.8 percent per year starting in 2015 after increasing by 1.3 percent per year since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatric cancer care has made significant progress over the past few decades, including chemotherapy, surgeries, and targeted immunotherapies, causing survival rates to tick up.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, the rate of new cancer diagnoses was about eight percent lower than expected. This drop is attributed to pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare, which affected routine screenings, doctor visits, and access to healthcare services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates generally continued to decrease during the period 2018–2022, with an average annual decrease of 1.7 percent for men and 1.3 percent for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the pandemic may have influenced this trend, particularly in 2020, when diagnoses were likely delayed and cancers were detected at later stages when they are often harder to treat and have a lower survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found no evidence of data issues or reporting delays; the 2020 decline was real and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to men, the death rate from lung and bronchus cancer in women decreased the fastest, with an average annual drop of 3.4 percent from 2018 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US during the four years combined was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women.

Researchers found associations between memory performance and cardiovascular risk factors, immune markers, and Alzheimer’s biomarkers (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) in individuals aged 24–44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these early-life cognitive differences emerged even without clinical symptoms of decline. The findings suggest that prevention strategies should begin in young adulthood to effectively reduce long-term Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Onset Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s-linked biomarkers were associated with cognitive function in people as young as 24.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Risk Score:&lt;/strong&gt; The CAIDE score, which includes lifestyle and genetic risk factors, correlated with memory performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATN Biomarkers Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers were linked to cognition before midlife, though APOE risk was not yet apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer’s disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108927"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer’s disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to cognitive impairment in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet- Regional Health Americas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, research on Alzheimer’s disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older,” said Allison Aiello, PhD, James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer’s disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and blood biomarkers are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer’s risk factors—such as cardiovascular health, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994-1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70 percent (71.4–72.5%) were White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11, 449 individuals aged 24-34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34-44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews, were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for genetic testing. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50,” Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically — genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer’s disease risk in older populations. ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course,” Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer’s disease in the coming decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors are Jennifer Momkus, Chantel L.

We examined whether established risk factors and blood biomarkers are associated with cognition before midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) were analyzed. Participants were enrolled in 1994–95 (grades 7–12) and followed through 2018. We cross-sectionally analyzed weighted survey and biomarker data from Waves IV and V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score comprised of age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesteroal, and physical activity and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also measured total Tau and Neurofilament light (NfL), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Outcomes included immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analytic sample sizes ranged from 4507 to 11,449 participants in Wave IV and from 529 to 1121 participants in Wave V. The survey-weighted median (IQR) age was 28 (26–29) years in Wave IV and 38 (36–29) years in Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the survey-weighted Wave IV participants were female (48.4–52.1% across analytic samples), 71.4–72.5% were White, 12.5–14.9% were Black, and 9.3–10.2% were Hispanic. In Wave V, 43.6–46.8% were female, 68.7–69.3% were White, 17.1%–20.0% were Black, and 7.3%–9.6% were Hispanic. The CAIDE score was associated with all cognition measures in Wave IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, among adults aged 24–34, each 1-point increase in CAIDE was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation lower backward digit span score (95% CI: −0.04, −0.02). Total Tau was associated with immediate word recall in Wave V (β = −0.13, 95% CI: −0.23, −0.04). Wave IV hsCRP and IL-10 and Wave V IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 were also associated with lower cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease are linked to cognitive function as early as ages 24–44, highlighting the need for early prevention in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHP01HD31921, U01AG071448, U01AG071450, R01AG057800, P30AG066615, T32HD091058, P2CHD050924.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:09:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5JcTRFamxtZFd5WjhYNWg1ZjhhaDZpb0pES3FHR2xhVDFBcDAzN1d1djE4dWpUWUFwR3pTemhzQk1BcE5CTzViNTRPQ1R4dTd5M0FFWDRWMW1HMWpPMVMzTS1UVXNXejlkSzZVN0FDczd1Yzg</guid></item><item><title>突破性药物恢复视力：研究人员成功逆转视网膜损伤- SciTechDaily | Breakthrough Drug Restores Vision: Researchers Successfully Reverse Retinal Damage - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk</guid></item><item><title>高蛋白柠檬鸡ORZO - EatingWell | High-Protein Lemon Chicken Orzo - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTFBhclVfTUx0TFdUanRiRktCN2lFMlVHdklDZFQ0Yy1vSGdHLXVlTmlBUlNKZzl5S2pPT244MFRtSUxZdHhwckdxQ2pTQ2diWGpYb2tfZnEtdmRHbGJPcVpkY1lpM2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mm-recipes-intro__content_1-0" class="comp mm-recipes-intro__content mntl-sc-page mntl-block" data-sc-sticky-offset="190" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="1" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one-skillet &lt;strong&gt;Lemon Chicken Orzo&lt;/strong&gt; is the flavorful weeknight dinner you’ve been looking for.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Toasting the orzo enhances its flavor, adding a nutty richness that wouldn’t be achieved otherwise. Coating the orzo in oil also helps prevent it from sticking and allows for even cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To save time, consider using shredded rotisserie chicken and stirring it into the other ingredients at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can’t find whole-wheat orzo, regular or tricolor orzo would work well. You can also substitute chicken thighs or another cut of chicken, and including feta cheese would add some extra flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We recommend cooking in a cast-iron skillet, but you can also use a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet or sauté pan.&lt;/li&gt;

Spinach is especially rich in vitamin K, a nutrient that supports healthy bones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicken broth &lt;/strong&gt;typically doesn’t add a whole lot of nutrition (though this does vary by brand). It can, however, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;add a lot of sodium&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to check the label and choose a reduced-sodium or no-salt-added broth.

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has identified an influenza virus circulating in pigs that shows multiple traits associated with pandemic potential. Known as H1N2, the virus belongs to a lineage of flu viruses that originated in birds, adapted to pigs, and has now been detected in humans. According to researchers, this strain—called 1C H1N2—has the ability to infect human airway cells, transmit between individuals, and escape most people’s existing immunity. These characteristics place it in a high-risk category under a pandemic risk framework published last year in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" aria-label="Nature Communications"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses are not exclusive to humans. They also infect birds, pigs, horses, and other animals. In pigs, three main subtypes circulate: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These viruses are further divided into genetic lineages based on their evolutionary history. The 1C lineage emerged in Europe in 1979, when an avian flu virus crossed into pigs and contributed genetic material to a new strain. Since then, the 1C lineage has remained largely confined to swine populations in Europe and Asia—until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2011 and 2024, viruses from the 1C lineage have been detected in humans at least 29 times, with almost half of those cases occurring since 2021. Most of these cases appear to be isolated spillover events from pigs, but their increasing frequency is cause for concern. Surveillance data also suggest that individuals who work with pigs are more likely to have been exposed to these viruses, underscoring the potential for transmission at the human–animal interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 influenza have been increasing since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings from the new study is how little immunity most people have to the 1C H1N2 virus. In blood samples collected from U.S. adults, only about one-third showed any detectable neutralizing antibodies, and most of those were from individuals born before 1950. This limited protection appears to stem from residual immunity to the 1918-like viruses that circulated early in the 20th century. More recent generations show almost no immune recognition of 1C H1N2. Current seasonal flu vaccines also offer little to no cross-protection, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laboratory tests, the 1C H1N2 virus displayed several traits associated with the ability to spread among humans. Like the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, it binds preferentially to receptors found in the human upper respiratory tract—an important trait for human-to-human transmission. It replicated efficiently in cultured human airway cells and remained stable in aerosol-like droplets across a range of humidity levels, mimicking the conditions respiratory viruses encounter in real-world settings. The virus also showed high neuraminidase activity, a feature that has been linked to increased transmissibility. Neuraminidase is a key protein on the virus’s surface that helps it escape from infected cells to infect new cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the virus’s ability to cross species, researchers conducted transmission experiments using pigs and ferrets—a standard model for studying influenza in humans. Infected pigs were housed near uninfected ferrets with no direct contact. While the ferrets showed no symptoms, all of them developed antibodies against the virus after exposure, indicating successful transmission. Notably, even ferrets that had prior immunity to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain became infected, suggesting that existing human immunity may not prevent spread of the 1C virus if it were to emerge more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 have appeared in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the pandemic risk assessment framework, viruses that exhibit a specific set of traits should be prioritized for surveillance. The 1C H1N2 virus checks nearly every box. It evades existing immunity in most people, binds to human-type airway receptors, and replicates efficiently in human bronchial cells. It remains stable in airborne droplets under typical humidity conditions and has a low pH of fusion—meaning its surface proteins can undergo the necessary changes for cell entry within the acidic compartments of human airway cells. In animal studies, it transmitted through the air both to naïve ferrets and to those with prior immunity to the H1N1 strain responsible for the 2009 pandemic. Taken together, these features place 1C H1N2 among the highest-risk flu viruses currently circulating in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that meeting the biological criteria for pandemic risk does not guarantee a severe outcome. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus also spread widely and met many of the same risk thresholds, but caused relatively mild illness in most cases. That experience was a reminder that pandemics can vary in severity—and that a virus can be highly transmissible without being highly lethal. The current study does not evaluate how deadly the 1C H1N2 virus might be. In fact, infections in pigs were mild, and the virus is not classified as a highly pathogenic strain like the H5N1 avian flu currently circulating in U.S. dairy herds and poultry. Still, the ability to spread efficiently in humans—especially when combined with low levels of immunity—makes early detection and risk assessment essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of 1C H1N2 underscores the importance of both structured risk assessment and detailed experimental investigation. In this case, researchers combined serology, molecular virology, and animal models to evaluate a virus that would otherwise remain hidden in the background of routine surveillance. Their work demonstrates how careful, labor-intensive studies can bring clarity to potential threats before they escalate. While it remains uncertain whether this virus will ever spread widely in humans—or how severe it might be if it does—this study provides a strong scientific basis for keeping it on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

The study identifies tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene as a shared mechanism that disrupts gene splicing and contributes to ASD-like social behaviors in individuals with DM1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mis-splicing creates protein imbalances that interfere with brain development and function.

While ASD is present in around one per cent of the general population, it is 14 times more likely to develop in people with DM1.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that the genetic variation that causes DM1 — tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene — also impacts brain development. The research team found that the effects of TREs interfere with a critical process called gene splicing, which is essential for gene function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disruption causes a protein imbalance that can result in mis-splicing of multiple genes involved in brain function, and may explain why some of the social and behavioural outcomes of ASD develop in people with DM1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism,” explains Dr. Ryan Yuen, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are TREs? &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;TREs occur when sections of a DNA strand are repeated two or more times, and the likelihood of those repeats causing errors in gene function increases each time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Yuen discovered that TREs are genetic contributors to autism, identifying more than 2,588 different places in the genome where TREs were much more prevalent in people with ASD. Similarly, people with DM1 have a TRE in the DMPK gene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease,” says Dr. Łukasz Sznajder, a research lead and Assistant Professor at UNLV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gene splicing a key contributor to the development of ASD &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the tandem repeat expands in the DMPK gene, the research team, including collaborators at the University of Florida and Adam Mickiewicz University (Poland), found its altered RNA binds to a protein that is involved in gene splicing regulation during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called “toxic RNA” depletes the protein and prevents it from binding to other RNA molecules in important areas of the genome, causing a protein imbalance which results in mis-splicing other genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly,” explains Yuen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yuen Lab and Sznajder Lab are already exploring whether this mis-splicing is happening in other genes associated with ASD, as well as how their findings could inform precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this work is already underway. In 2020, Dr. Christopher Pearson, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids, identified a molecule that can contract TREs in Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to identify how this could be applied to other conditions, the team remains optimistic their findings could inform future research and care for DM1, ASD and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Azrieli Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy Association, the UNVL startup fund, the University of Florida Centre for Autism and Neurodevelopment, the National Science Centre, Poland, SickKids Research Institute, Brain Canada, the Government of Ontario, the University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), The Petroff Family Foundation, Tribute Communities, The Marigold Foundation and SickKids Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Autism and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed8b9f8c838e889e8e8cc39d8c86ad9e848e868684899ec38e8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Francesca Pak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sickkids.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Yuen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide enrichment of gene-specific tandem repeat expansions has been linked to autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mutation is the CTG tandem repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt; gene, which is known to cause myotonic muscular dystrophy type 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there is a clear clinical association between autism and myotonic dystrophy, the molecular basis for this connection remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that sequestration of MBNL splicing factors by mutant DMPK RNAs with expanded CUG repeats alters the RNA splicing patterns of autism-risk genes during brain development, particularly a class of autism-relevant microexons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that both &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt;-CTG expansion and &lt;em&gt;Mbnl&lt;/em&gt; null mouse models recapitulate autism-relevant mis-splicing profiles, along with social behavioral deficits and altered responses to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support our model that myotonic dystrophy-associated autism arises from developmental mis-splicing of autism-risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE51d0xvNmdCLWZGWWtwc0NIV0xqZ05TTVJRdUNSbzh3eWpjTVVXMW93UEJwdTNzV2p4QVV0dnR1Vk1xUUZHRXpicjdqWEdON3lmXzFOaGJfa3lGUTE4WnhobWRB</guid></item><item><title>由营养师制定的7天高蛋白地中海饮食计划，帮助减掉内脏脂肪- EatingWell | 7-Day High-Protein Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan to Help Lose Visceral Fat, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxORS1hblAwNjNmX1F3eXJyeFRHdkt5N2tOaUY1azltUjhrYkRNSEJ3aEN3dGM5dnZXY2RkTHlNM0ROWmRxRlhFcnJwMDA1RUFXdVZodERXWE1OcmFRS1V6WmN6VFV4TVNvTTdhcGVsYU9DbE1JdWxnR0lmczA5ZkVSN2tVWUlMR3F6ZGt1N0VJWkpiX3RBWE5BSHR6MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different meal in this list or browse more of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we chose recipes with total daily calories, protein and fiber in mind, it may be helpful to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile or plan to adjust a snack or two, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, go for it! Each breakfast option spans 352 to 409 calories while lunches range from 314 to 410 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to make small adjustments to snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat refers to fat around the abdominal region. It can surround internal organs and increase the risk of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is also linked to an increase in inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_171-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4274/mediterranean-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is a popular way of eating that emphasizes protein, legumes, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats. It limits refined grains, ultra-processed foods and added sugars. This eating style is often praised for its flexibility, health benefits and nutritional quality—but does it help with weight loss? Research points to the Mediterranean diet as an effective strategy for both weight loss and a reduced risk for gaining weight over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you can’t necessarily &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;target specific areas for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, reducing total body fat can often lead to a reduction in visceral fat. Because of its focus on whole grains, beans, lentils and ample produce, the Mediterranean diet tends to be high in fiber. Fiber is an important nutrient with many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; and research shows that it can have benefits for weight loss as well.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the Mediterranean diet does not restrict any particular food groups, which means it’s likely more sustainable long-term.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can be a double-edged sword, especially for very young kids. Recent research has found evidence that frequent antibiotic use can raise children’s risk of childhood asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Rutgers University led the research, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf191/8114163"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study found that children given antibiotics before the age of two were noticeably more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and allergies later on, particularly the more antibiotics they took. The findings are the latest to suggest that antibiotics should be carefully managed in their use, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are our best weapon against bacterial infections. But scientists have known for decades that they don’t come without risks. Bacteria have steadily learned how to resist these drugs, for instance, and antibiotic resistance is now one of the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;most pressing public health issues&lt;/a&gt; of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another risk concerns the microbiome, the neighborhood of usually harmless and often helpful bacteria that live in or on our bodies. Many antibiotics are broad-spectrum, meaning they can kill a wide variety of bacteria, including these friendly bacteria. The splash damage caused by antibiotics might then &lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/what-happens-to-the-gut-microbiome-after-taking-antibiotics-69970"&gt;disturb the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could increase our risk of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some research has suggested that antibiotic-triggered disruptions of the microbiome are even more harmful to children, with studies linking their use to chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10142236/"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;. But according to the Rutgers researchers, past studies had limitations—such as small sample sizes and numerous variables to account for—issues they tried to minimize in their new study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the medical records of over one million children born in the UK. They also conducted a separate analysis of children and their siblings, allowing them to compare children with similar environmental and genetic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that antibiotic use before age two was positively linked to a higher risk of asthma, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). They also found a possible association between antibiotic use and intellectual disability in general. On the positive side, they failed to find any connection between antibiotics and most other conditions they looked for, including autism spectrum disorder, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research can’t prove that antibiotics are triggering asthma in some young children, it can only suggest a correlation. But the researchers did see a higher risk of asthma in children who took more antibiotics than others, which is evidence of a dose-response effect. The same pattern was also seen when the researchers only compared children to their siblings, further strengthening a causative link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown that antibiotics are frequently prescribed when they shouldn’t be, such as for infections likely not caused by bacteria—a problem in children as well. A study in 2020, for instance, found that one of every four children given antibiotics in hospitals likely &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/1-in-4-kids-who-get-antibiotics-in-childrens-hospitals-are-prescribed-the-drugs-incorrectly/"&gt;didn’t need&lt;/a&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So while further research might be warranted to confirm these links between antibiotics and certain chronic childhood conditions like asthma, the take-home message should remain the same: We need to rein in our use of these vital, but not risk-free, medications, perhaps even more so in kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics are important and sometimes life-saving medicines, but not all infections in young kids need to be treated with antibiotics,” said lead author Daniel Horton, an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers School of Public Health, in a &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/frequent-use-antibiotics-infants-and-young-children-may-increase-risk-asthma-allergies-and"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “Parents should continue to consult with their children’s doctors on the best course of care.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Conducted with nearly 900 parents, the research found that while both emotions were beneficial, awe had a stronger impact on psychological richness and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, offering a sense of wonder that slows time and deepens emotional connection. These findings suggest that everyday moments with children—not just major milestones—can offer profound emotional rewards that help buffer the mental health challenges of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe improves well-being more holistically than pride by enhancing life meaning and emotional richness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe can make time feel slower, helping parents immerse fully in special moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe doesn’t require rare events—it can arise from everyday interactions like outings or shared joy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from the University of Rochester suggests that experiencing feelings of pride and awe toward one’s children can significantly enhance parental well-being. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which will be published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;, found that these positive emotions contribute to greater life satisfaction and stronger parent-child bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108919"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a parent and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Princeton Chee, conducted a series of studies involving nearly 900 parents to examine how parental pride and awe affect various aspects of well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parental pride and awe are common and beneficial feelings parents can have with their children,” explains Chee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents may feel proud when their child does something they worked hard to succeed in and accomplish. They may feel awe when their child does something amazing or completely unexpected that make them feel like saying ‘woah’ or ‘wow.'” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both emotions proved beneficial, the research showed that awe had more profound effects on overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that awe can actually strengthen parental well-being more broadly and holistically, compared to pride, making parents lives feel happier, more meaningful, and richer in experiences,” Chee notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, such as the parent-child relationship or the concept of parenthood itself, while pride tends to focus more on personal ego and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction helps explain why awe showed stronger associations with purpose, meaning, and psychological richness in parents’ lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly noteworthy was the finding that awe can alter parents’ perception of time. “Awe in particular can help parents fully immerse themselves by making time feel like it’s slowing down during extraordinary moments,” says Chee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research appears especially relevant amid growing concerns about parental mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents everywhere are struggling with mental health and well-being, with even the US surgeon general calling for an urgent need to better support parents,” Chee points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research finds that one way in which parenthood can be rewarding, rather than detrimental, is through feeling pride and especially awe with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, experiencing parental awe doesn’t require rare or exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awe may be easier to find and cultivate than you might think,” Chee explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be only once in a lifetime, extraordinary experiences in which parents feel awe. These certainly are rewarding moments that elicit awe, but awe, along with its many rewards, can also be cultivated through things as simple as weekend outings and quality time spent with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Rather, the findings suggest that cultivating and savoring moments of pride and awe can help parents find greater joy, meaning, and richness in the parenting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this parenting and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196a6e78757d6b7677596a696a6937766b7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephen Waldron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spsp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephen Waldron – Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19485506251332690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;” by Princeton Chee et al. &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenthood is challenging but fulfilling. We examined how parental pride and awe may enhance various aspects of well-being across cross-sectional (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 505), longitudinal (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 130), and experimental (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 261) studies, along with an internal meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thematic analyses suggested similar yet unique frequencies and underpinnings of pride (child growth, talent, resilience, and good behavior) and awe (child love/kindness, growth, talent, and shared moments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, we found that pride predicted greater pleasure (i.e., high satisfaction and low negative affect), and awe predicted greater pleasure, purpose (i.e., meaning), and variety (i.e., psychological richness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that strengthened relationship quality with a child, self-transcendence (for pride and awe), and slowed time perception (for awe) served as mechanisms for these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these rewards were consistent across parent and child characteristics and could not be explained by child temperament or other positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate how pride and awe can make parenting bright, meaningful, and rich.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:08:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1ucjI2dWVEUTkxSGRTUkl6RlNCVmwxM1hYaE42YTNMNGp2c25mbzlIUVA1OFdzYzNPaE9mNWVkSTlaWlAxRGNRcWVZcTRRZTFYX3F6SU41WTR0WXBoeF9hZDF2QlJRdVVqbWw1VGJiOHV1V1pjbl9JZQ</guid></item><item><title>“为呼吸而战” ：随着疫苗接种率的下降，百日咳激增- NBC新闻 | 'Fighting to breathe': Whooping cough surges as vaccination rates drop - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNTzVDRnpXYnRNWXUzZ01sT3RzWEZfQWVxMDVOODJld2lPWTB4Umw5QVVhbldLLTh6aWttRXlBeHZZeVBwb0FBZTZoVFVGVVk2UWxZS0dwQ2ZPYXNxSVl4M1VGcVVtcEVVMWwtSGw4RTlxT243MWpPLWVSOVNjMF9MckxfSDktRlZFbzczSkhWLUc5VExQVEF5d2MyWdIBVkFVX3lxTFBWbEtwVUd0LXRwcm9iMTZISGQwMlFFLXZQWmRGNWJLU3hNdTZVeFdrdVFiamhVazcxeGVpZzBFSGQ4SUJ1eEFfMjNvd0hqOFZXbU5FYlln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kate and Greg Moor weren’t thinking&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/whooping-cough-spike-unvaccinated-teens-rcna171781" target="_blank"&gt; “whooping cough” &lt;/a&gt;when their son, 13-year-old Joe, started having coughing fits in early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Joe probably just had a&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-cases-high-cdc-illness-hospitalizations-rcna191203" target="_blank"&gt; late winter virus&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, couple figured.

It’s also called whooping cough because of the sound some kids make during the coughing fits that Joe experienced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The constant hacking is exhausting and sometimes life-threatening, doctors say, especially for small children and babies with tiny airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re unable to catch their breath,” said Dr. Sapna Singh of Texas Children’s Pediatrics near Houston. “They’re fighting for air. They’re fighting to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The virulent cough is unparalleled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had a patient this year who broke two ribs coughing,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We had an infant who coughed so hard that they ended up with a pneumothorax,” also known as a collapsed lung. “That’s essentially when your lung pokes a hole out of itself and air starts collecting outside the lung.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why whooping cough is making a comeback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data&lt;/a&gt;, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Michigan, where the Moor family lives, whooping cough cases have skyrocketed. There were 110 cases in the state in 2023, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/pertussisupdates" target="_blank"&gt; state’s department of health&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, 2,081 cases were reported — a nearly 1,800% increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The state’s on track to meet or exceed last year’s number. In 2025, 497 whooping cough cases have been reported in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Louisiana, two young infants died of pertussis within the last six months, the state's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;urgeon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yiQ4LjRwUsoKcB28MFxtnP6s2YwEHSx6m8PoyX1HqFhW67MTTp5fpNjsKoX9AraUl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;eneral posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March.

A new study with the largest dataset of its kind has identified distinct brain activity patterns that separate lucid dreaming from both REM sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research reveals unique shifts in perception, memory, and self-awareness that occur during this rare conscious state within sleep. These findings challenge the traditional boundary between wakefulness and sleep, suggesting consciousness can emerge entirely from within the dream state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Brain Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Lucid dreaming shows neural patterns distinct from REM sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Awareness in Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain regions linked to cognitive control and self-perception are more active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consciousness Redefined:&lt;/strong&gt; The study supports the idea that consciousness can arise during sleep without waking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucid dreaming is a surreal phenomenon in which people are consciously aware that they are in a dream. Çağatay Demirel, from Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Radboud University Medical Center, and colleagues shed light on the neural correlates of lucid dreaming in their &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a rigorous processing pipeline as they collected and assembled data from multiple labs to create what is, according to the authors, the largest sample size to date for this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108911"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows clouds and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lucid-dreaming-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Comparisons of brain activity during lucid dreaming, rapid eye movement sleep, and wakefulness revealed distinct activity patterns for lucid dreaming.

During initial LD eye signaling compared to baseline, source-level gamma1 power (30-36 Hz) increased in right temporo-occipital regions, including the right precuneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased inter-hemispheric and inter-regional gamma1 connectivity during LD, reflecting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that distinct source-level power and connectivity patterns characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying LD, including shifts in network communication and regional activation that may underlie the specific changes in perception, memory processing, self-awareness, and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:29:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1tSGZHeVVyMkhoU0k2bVVya3BOV2NudEgxSnh1d3MySUY4RmNIWXBWTHBmcmwzanI4VGpWRnZSa3h4RnFkU25nY2NONHk1R3pqRnlCdHFtZ1BWRFJDMjUwY2l2aHF5Q3hiTWZfZC1sd0hWUQ</guid></item><item><title>越南报告H5N1禽流感脑炎病例- CIDRAP | Vietnam reports H5N1 avian flu case with encephalitis - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPbzNCTE1IMkJDSm5FSzVpOXdfMExNVXR6S3p1WkhQYWZKUEF6TUdEQ0xjeFhEZEJ0eGtDdWxpdkhTY0puLUVhVk9NVkhENzFjTFMxQktNYm5hQkdHZHMyWm1CZGlaVnpCMVBkMVB6WHJXMWVyZGZWNUdkNkQ4MkEzVS0xbG9uQXZpSFZ5QXlKWG1ETG9HZzVVRVhXbkR3VG1zRFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Vietnam have reported a severe H5N1 avian flu infection in an 8-year-old girl who is experiencing encephalitis symptoms, which appears to mark the country's first human case of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl is from Tay Ninh province, located in southern Vietnam between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City, according to an April 18 statement from the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Health that was translated and posted by &lt;a href="https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/asia/h5n1-h5n8-h1n08-tracking/vietnam-aa/1011898-vietnam-8-year-old-child-suffered-from-encephalitis-due-to-h5n1-avian-influenza-virus-ho-chi-minh-city-doh-tay-ninh-province-april-18-2025"&gt;FluTrackers&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease new message board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient's symptoms, which included fever, headache, and vomiting, began on April 11, and she was initially admitted to a provincial hospital. When her condition didn't improve, she was transferred to Children's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on April 13, where she was diagnosed as having encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the girl has an underlying heart condition and had surgery for a ventricular septal defect when she was 2 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymerase chain reaction tests on her respiratory samples were negative for H5 avian flu, but her cerebrospinal fluid sample was positive for the virus, with results confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient remains hospitalized on a ventilator with stable vital signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epidemiologic investigation found that, before she got sick, the child had contact with a poultry flock at her grandmother's house that had experienced mass deaths 2 weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Earlier report described meningitis presentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said H5N1 infections that involve only the central nervous system are rare but have been reported before, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa044307"&gt;2004 in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; when clinicians identified H5N1 in the cerebrospinal one of two siblings who died within weeks of each other from severe neurologic symptoms, but without respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the illness spectrum is wider than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam reported its last human H5 case in &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-human-h5-avian-flu-case"&gt;December 2024&lt;/a&gt;, which involved an 18-year-old man from Long An province who was exposed to sick poultry and died from his infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear which H5N1 clade infected the girl, but in 2024 scientists warned of an H5N1 reassortant circulating across the Greater Mekong region that has infected both birds and people. It contains surface proteins of an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) that has circulated in parts of Asia with a newer clade (2.3.4.4b) that has circulated globally since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There's sun one day, and then wind and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/our-best-tips-to-protect-your-smart-home-tech-in-the-snow-and-rain/" target="_self"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; rush in the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;If you're &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3166406/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; deficient or just need a boost without using &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, check out these foods that are rich in vitamin D. The benefits of vitamin D stem from supporting &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-muscle-building-foods/" target="_self"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/pack-your-diet-with-these-12-brain-healthy-foods-for-a-mental-boost/" target="_self"&gt;neurological&lt;/a&gt; health to helping with calcium absorption in the bones and, most importantly, serving as a great defender against attacks on your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-immunity-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods high in vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of vitamin D can vary depending on the fish you use. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698592/" target="_self"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found farmed salmon had 25% of the vitamin D content as found in wild-caught salmon. As such, if you're getting vitamin D from fish sources, try to opt for wild-caught fish instead of farmed-raised fish. The USDA says sockeye salmon has an average of 670 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swordfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fatty fish that is an excellent source of vitamin D is the swordfish. The USDA lists a 100-gram serving as having 666 IU of vitamin D. That's more than the 600 IU daily recommendation for people ages 1 to 70 years old, so cooking up some swordfish for dinner may help you easily meet your vitamin D needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tuna&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lunchtime staple can also pack a vitamin D punch. While not as high as salmon or swordfish, fresh yellowfin tuna still contains 82 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. It can be a food to include as part of an overall diet in vitamin D rich foods. However, bluefin tuna has 227 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, so check which type of tuna you're eating as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Egg yolks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As listed by the USDA, one whole egg yolk packs a whopping 218 IU in vitamin D. Simply making a frittata or some scrambled eggs in the morning with two eggs could give you a 436-IU boost of vitamin D. That's a good way to start off any morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Orange juice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While oranges are more known for their vitamin C, orange juice often comes fortified with added vitamin D to help boost our health. Check the label on your orange juice to see if it has been fortified with vitamin D. One study found that both vitamin D2 and D3 are as equally &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869510/" target="_self"&gt;bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; in orange juice as taking vitamin D capsules, meaning the body can still absorb the vitamins well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified milk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk is another drink that is often fortified with vitamin D to help us get this valuable nutrient. Like orange juice, milk is not a natural source of vitamin D, but the FDA allows &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/vitamin-d-milk-and-milk-alternatives" target="_self"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to voluntarily add up to 84 IU of vitamin D3 per 100 grams of milk and 84 IU per 100 grams of D2 to plant-based milk alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified cereal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good way to access vitamin D is to choose cereals that have been fortified with it. There are a wide variety of cereals that all add vitamin D. You simply need to check the label of what you are buying. The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-d/art-20363792" target="_self"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; lists fortified cereal as a good source of Vitamin D. You might look for more healthy brands of cereal, such as whole grain options, which are more likely to fortify with higher levels of Vitamin D and be better for you overall. Try to avoid highly sugary cereals with fewer nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beef liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver is a love-it-or-hate-it food, but if you like beef liver, it's another good way to get vitamin D. You can either cook it up, popular with onions, or liver sausage can be a good source of vitamin D. According to the USDA, pan-fried cooked beef liver has 40 IU of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/usdandb/VitaminD-Content.pdf" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; in a single slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sardines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another food people either really love or really hate. However, if you're a sardine fan, sardines have a higher amount of vitamin D as well. The USDA says 100 grams of canned sardines have 193 IU of vitamin D. Enjoy sardines on some crackers or add them to your favorite pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Herring &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring is another type of fatty fish that is popular to eat out of a jar and on crackers, or you can cook it up for dinner. Herring boasts 214 IU of vitamin D for a 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. In fact, herring is a popular food to eat around the holidays in the Midwest. During the cold and darker months, it's a convenient and popular holiday food, and it boasts fairly high vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wild Mushrooms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for vitamin D that doesn't come from an animal source, mushrooms are perfect. Just like us, mushrooms create &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d#6.-Mushrooms" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to UV light from the sun. Fungi are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213178/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D2&lt;/a&gt; (animal sources contain vitamin D3), and one cup of wild mushrooms can equal about 136 IU of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:01:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNYVFza2tmdlAyV0ptWGVtLVc0cm5SQlZTVXFqZmVrcWdCNEpvcC1MSnA4XzZFYzR6NWVCUnJFTFBqVmp4Z2tzemtfd01kYnNKMWgwaG9SbTlLU3h1VEUzY3kwY2FmMjBnMlZ6VXNuQTJqR0dWUmE1b2N1aWpuQkZOd3NxTl9Nd0tuemVGRTBtcnpDSzY2SFE</guid></item><item><title>未接种疫苗的儿童长期感染COVID的风险高达20倍，分析发现- Medical Xpress | Unvaccinated kids face up to 20 times higher risk of long COVID, analysis finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPYXFWVFI5WklnUE0tZFVIRjR5bXk4Tlg1eWFRWHFxODBwU3hVeUdqamVWYm1pVTVlZkRrblpiRjNBb0RZbUtLajBSSGdPbWNJNXNfSGRRVXV6RXo1RTV3cUU0RzZkc3BYTzhNZXItVkgwXzl0Y2RDVDd3ZF83Q215QUlsRHZuVk4xS1pn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated children and adolescents were up to 20 times more likely to develop long COVID than their vaccinated peers, according to new research led by a team from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the analysis they performed also indicated that protection afforded by the vaccine primarily comes from preventing infection in the first place, rather than offering special protection against long COVID itself.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In other words, vaccination has been key to preventing COVID-19 infection, which is important to reducing the risk of long COVID as well," said Yong Chen, Ph.D., a professor of Biostatistics and senior author of the study &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537024005418" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID's impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the enduring mysteries of the COVID-19 pandemic is the cause of "long COVID," a collection of symptoms that can appear or persist weeks and months after a person's initial infection has subsided. While the underlying mechanisms of this syndrome remain unclear, scientists know that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; often give rise to post-viral syndromes featuring fatigue, "brain fog," and other non-specific symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections, caused by the emergent coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are no exception: Long COVID, known more formally as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), became remarkably common during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in June 2022, after the worst phases of the pandemic had passed, a survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) suggested that about 7.5% of Americans, including more than 9% of American women, were still suffering from long COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the causes of long COVID remain unclear and no common treatments are currently available, some prior studies have examined whether vaccination prior to infection offers any protection against developing long COVID. However, their findings have been inconsistent. New research now suggests that vaccines may offer greater protection against long COVID than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior studies that simply compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may not fully capture the true impact of vaccination on long COVID, as they often overlook the fact that vaccination substantially reduces the risk of infection in the first place," said co-author Jeffrey Morris, Ph.D., director of Biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research on vaccine effectiveness against long COVID has primarily focused on adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study targets children and adolescents because their immune responses to vaccines and the development of long COVID symptoms might differ significantly from those seen in adults," Morris explained.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Protection against long COVID or infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a research initiative known as RECOVER—which gathers and analyzes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health systems&lt;/a&gt; nationwide to better understand long COVID—the research team conducted an observational study with de-identified electronic health records from nearly 400,000 children and adolescents across the United States. The study pulled data from the major COVID-19 waves of 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these records, the researchers constructed three separate groups or "cohorts" of vaccinated and unvaccinated young people: 112,590 adolescents (12-to-20-year-olds) whose records from July through Nov 2021—when delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 dominated—were analyzed, and 188,894 children (5-to-11-year-olds) and 84,735 adolescents from records dating to January through November 2022—when omicron was dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that the vaccine was about 95% effective in preventing long COVID in adolescents during the delta wave of 2021—meaning vaccinated adolescents were only about 5% as likely to get long COVID compared to their unvaccinated peers. In this cohort, the researchers found 0.11 cases of long COVID in the vaccinated group per 10,000 person-weeks (a statistical measure that accounts for the number of participants and how long they participated), compared to 3.54 cases in the unvaccinated group—a 32-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In 2022, against omicron variants, vaccination was about 60% effective in preventing long COVID in the 5-to-11-year-old group and 75% effective in the 12-to-20-year-old group. In the children's group, the long COVID incidence rates were 0.33 in vaccinated children and 1.07 among the unvaccinated (the rate tripled in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/unvaccinated+children/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt;). Among adolescents in omicron, the incidence rates were 0.24 in the vaccinated and 1.43 among the unvaccinated (almost a six-fold difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using mediation analysis, we were able to disentangle how much of the vaccine's protection was due to preventing initial infection versus a direct benefit on long COVID after infection," said first author Qiong Wu, Ph.D., who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn Medicine and is now an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mediation analysis suggested that, once infected, vaccinated children and adolescents were just as likely to develop long COVID as their unvaccinated peers. This seemed to indicate no additional, special protective effect once infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preventing COVID-19 infections in the first place, including through vaccination, appears to be the best way to avoid long COVID," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer's disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer's disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S. The findings are published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25000973" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet-Regional Health Americas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previously, research on Alzheimer's disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older," said Allison Aiello, Ph.D., James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School. "The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer's disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+biomarkers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations provide a baseline for predicting long-term trajectories of cognitive decline. "Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer's risk factors—such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, body mass index, cholesterol, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+factor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994–1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70% (71.4–72.5%) were white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11,449 individuals aged 24–34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34–44.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+testing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt;. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50," Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically—genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk. The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer's disease risk in older populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife. However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course," Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer's disease in the coming decades."&lt;/p&gt;

My response was appropriate; I vomited. I was the first person among my peers to get a cancer diagnosis. No one knew what to say or do for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LZGROKBSSJC4JBAPC2CL3KEQHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why news headlines like “&lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-younger-adults-what-to-know-about-screening-and-your-risk/2024/04" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Is on the Rise in Younger Adults&lt;/a&gt;” hit me hard. Worldwide, the incidence of early-onset cancers (those 18-49) has surged  almost 80 percent between 1990 and 2019; deaths from these cancers increased  almost 30 percent over that same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AARAPM73DVFY7OTWIVG7PCNTRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am now a 40-year survivor, something I didn’t think I’d live to see. While I’m glad researchers are working hard to understand why this rise in cases is occurring, I’ve found that telling my story to other young people can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JHFT456XFJC5PHQ2HOU47PIUDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It comes up in the strangest of places, at a college reunion or a friend’s birthday, and when I volunteer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I can put it no other way than to say I’m transformed into a gift called hope. (Or my story is.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUPY63CCOJGQHE3AAG5L67RJYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what happened after the oncologist told me I had testicular cancer: Over eight months, I had two surgeries and 16 administrations of a powerful chemotherapy “cocktail.” I lost the beard on my face and the hair on my head, chest and pubic region. I shed 15 percent of my body weight and experienced mouth sores, neuropathy, nausea, constipation and hearing loss. I was left with two scars, a three-incher in my pubic area and the other, a 12-incher that runs from below my belly button up to my breastbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LLBIIAUWFG5XIDWP3DKCUYJLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My cancer — which I named “Max” so that I could curse him out by name — affected every aspect of my life, from career and money to sex and intimacy, upending my mental health and my relationships. In the vernacular of young people today, it was “a lot.” I would have called it “too much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJGQDFTLCNHXJGGJZI2KQHTNYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I know all too well the fear and isolation many young people with cancer experience. Cancer is always a lonely proposition, but it’s especially so for young adults. The loneliness I experienced was pervasive. Older people, mostly my parents’ friends, didn’t understand, and my contemporaries often struggled because I had the dubious distinction to be their first friend facing a life-threatening illness. One grad school colleague told me years later, “I just didn’t know how to be your friend once you were diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S3DGBBQACFCODMWT3KH6MJ2GDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Back then, I joined a support group, where almost all my “peers” were married, had kids (even grandkids) or were retired. “Issues for someone age 25 may be very different from someone 35 or 45,” as well as those who are even older, Nancy Borstelmann, the co-director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://www.yalecancercenter.org/patient/specialty/early-onset-cancer-program/#:~:text=The%20Early%20Onset%20Cancer%20Program,onset%20cancer%20and%20their%20families." target="_blank"&gt;Early-Onset Cancer Program&lt;/a&gt;, told me recently. But if there’s one thing we all have in common, she said, it’s the “fear about dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJO4IXO4YJGFZPUVOASDNGFKYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To be fair, I didn’t always know what to say or do, either. I snapped at those who mindlessly asked how I was doing or even in some cases if I was going to die. My peer group just didn’t know better or have much experience with really sick people. One afternoon I got into a heated argument with a nurse who was suggesting a men’s “Small” for the prosthesis I needed. Like any other dude in his twenties, I insisted I was a “Large.” (There were no “Mediums” available.) I responded as though this was a life and death decision. Obviously not, but I did feel as though my “manhood” was on the line. This was new territory, and we all had lessons to learn, including me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMS5XJOX6NADRP4NKZZL7AYABM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I tried hard to wait to worry (or at least not to freak out) while awaiting pathology reports, X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scans. So much uncertainty. A nurse suggested &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664#:~:text=Biofeedback%20is%20a%20type%20of,get%20information%20about%20your%20body." target="_blank"&gt;biofeedback&lt;/a&gt; to me, which she explained could lessen my dependence on antianxiety drugs. I tried it and it helped. She also explained that the worst possible outcome is not the most common one. I struggled with that suggestion when she said it but time has proved her right; I remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCLT7ZRXGNCA3MPVPIPNDEWUGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were other challenges. Postsurgery I could no longer do everything for myself as I once had. That included bending over to tie my shoes or going food shopping. I needed help for the first time in my life; it took me a while to learn how to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYDHMWDSRRGYBKGSGR7BCWWDSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I didn’t know how to talk about my fears. While hospitalized for two weeks I relied on a well-honed sarcasm, which pushed people away, or my ever-growing list of grievances, like the poly/cotton sheets on my bed, the robes that never cover your butt, and the size of that silicone prosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XYKE2ULHIJEALBA6LEH7LM34JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I railed at the loss of control as I tried — in vain — to reassert it. When my hair began to fall out, I cut it off preemptively. Fearing that my boyfriend would leave me, I broke up with him first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PHU23XSNNBHJATKLK3WXPJALI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And I blamed myself. “What did I do to deserve this?” I asked repeatedly. I had yet to learn the lesson that bad things happen to good people, or really, that any illusion of control is just that. Cancer pierced any notion that life is fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VA6CGIVOYVCOFKCBFCHSCOOVL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I also discovered that the psychological side effects of my disease could rival the physical ones. My second, more complicated surgery had a frequent side effect of affecting fertility. At 26, I’d hardly given any thought to raising a family, when a hospital social worker asked me, “Would you like a referral to a sperm bank?” (Yes, I would.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHCGF3YR6RDFFIGQOQFAQYY4SA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few years after my diagnosis, and when all my treatments were done, I left grad school in a fog of uncertainty. I wrote in my journal back then: “If I have a shorter life, I don’t want to spend the next five years in this program.” I didn’t think about saving for retirement, buying a house, or doing any of the “adult” things my friends were now doing. Instead I bought a lot of nice sweaters, putting them on multiple credit cards. Why pay today, when tomorrow might not come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJQ7UOC5JNBLJNSZIM46HKRYJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’d be misleading you if I left the impression that all was dark. I found a new career as a writer. I met a new boyfriend. My hair grew back! I also chose to face some weighty questions: How do I live a life that matters? How do I want to spend my time? What gives me joy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HSHU4XJUGZHONC2FNVRTTFE7JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s the ironic thing about having cancer as a young adult: You confront the idea of death too soon, but if all goes well you have a lot of years afterward. You struggle to believe it’s behind you, while still dreading its return. But time does heal some wounds. It also gave me much-needed perspective, even a sense of humor. When I lost a job, separated from my husband and even when a huge branch of a pecan tree almost  crushed my house, I was able to say to myself, “At least, it’s not cancer!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPSFB5QWNNUHB5djZIQkR2cUpQbzRENUJBS2FPaWUxeXhSYWxIWElYRTJIY3h3M0pRbDhyb2FwaEQyTXk5SW9rU0pUc2E1RXlCQnFBNWtSVFJjeks0UTN6OTA4bTVzam1VQkxKM1pZM3pySkZGZXZQcExNQTZuaS05UlJOYmk3ajJvRFhTUQ</guid></item><item><title>如何快速安全地减掉多达5磅的水分- womansworld.com | How To Lose up to 5 Lbs of Water Weight Quickly + Safely - womansworld.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE13YXdTbHN2RVJwMFgyVTFfUmlNZVp0MllrVk1xVWRma1EzbjFWbVBvcHFsaF81d2xsb2NKOTdGY01VeEFzS2tTaTVIaTZpNnU3MWRTbkoySUlDRUlZQjhXZFVaUGliREJOLWtWUTFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-221442 single-format-standard post-lose-the-water-weight theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Last week, he promised to find some of the causes of rising U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-autism-cases-health-secretary-ca210c5c37e12d6377a1af16ae4f4fbc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism rates&lt;/a&gt; in under six months’ time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's followers — a contingent of health-conscious moms, Republicans loyal to President Donald Trump and others — have celebrated his “Make America Healthy Again” initiatives. But scientists and public health experts have expressed dismay over some of Kennedy's statements about Americans' diets, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a look at some of those claims Kennedy has made, with additional context and facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at a news conference Wednesday: Studies show that autism rates in the U.S. were “1 in 10,000 when I was a kid” compared to a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that found it to be 1 in 31. He says that is evidence of an autism epidemic in the U.S. and that, “we know it's an environmental exposure. It has to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: It’s true that in the 20th century, only 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism —- the diagnosis was rare and given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders,” and the number of kids labeled as having some form of autism began to balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The term “epidemic” is widely used to describe surges in different health problems — like autism, obesity and gun violence, to name a few. But strictly speaking, “epidemic” is defined as a fast-spreading outbreak of disease, and there's not good evidence that autism meets that definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials have largely attributed growing autism numbers to better recognition of cases, through wide screening and better diagnosis. Last week, the CDC said &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are no blood or biologic tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to his rise to health secretary, Kennedy joined anti-vaccine advocates in claiming childhood vaccines are responsible for autism, but studies by the CDC and others have ruled that out. A fraudulent single study that claimed a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy recently announced a major study into the cause of autism and told an April 10 Cabinet meeting: “By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” But last week, he softened that to having ”some of the answers by September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Mike Stobbe and Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in interview with Sean Hannity that aired on Fox News on March 11: “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is safe and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. There have been no documented deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/#:~:text=Fact%3A%20Getting%20the%20vaccine%20is,don't%20get%20the%20vaccine." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Infectious Diseases Society of America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people who get the MMR vaccine have no serious problems from it, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The most common side effects are mild: a sore arm, fever, mild rash and temporary joint pain or stiffness in teenage or adult women who don’t already have rubella immunity. There is a very small risk of febrile seizures that increases as infants get older, which is why the shot is recommended as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people can have allergic reactions; people allergic to the antibiotic neomycin should not get the shot, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in an April interview with CBS: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the (MMR) vaccine wanes very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.&lt;/a&gt; Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 million to 4 million cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;3 million to 4 million cases&lt;/a&gt; per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Usually, most measles cases come to the U.S. from abroad. This is why high vaccination rates are important. When 95% or more people are vaccinated, entire communities are considered protected from the virus, which is important for people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in a CBS interview posted April 9, discussing death of 8-year-old child in Texas who had measles: “The thing that killed (her) was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Two children in Texas have died — both from measles complications, according to the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services. The state health department has made clear that the children were not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Doctors at University Medical Center in Lubbock who treated the 8-year-old said she died of “measles pulmonary failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Claiming that patients die of complications and not the actual disease that led to them is a tactic that anti-vaccine advocates have used to undermine Texas health experts since the first child died of measles in March — and in other outbreaks before that. It's also a talking point that Kennedy, who spent &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-vaccines-trump-rfkjr-7f8dcb25de76a5a70710d22bbc63f6fa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;20 years&lt;/a&gt; as one of the world's leading anti-vaccine activists, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:continues to amplify;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;continues to amplify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles complications can include pneumonia, brain swelling and other respiratory or neurological complications, which can lead to death in 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,&lt;/a&gt; said two &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas doctors&lt;/a&gt; "have treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Pediatricians note there is no cure for measles: It is a virus that the body has to fight off on its own. The best way to protect against the risks of measles is to get vaccinated to lower the chance of contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Budesonide is a steroid used in different forms to treat asthma, ulcerative colitis and other conditions. Clarithromycin is an antibiotic; it fights bacteria, not viruses. Neither drug is recommended for treating measles — the use is “risky and unproven” — &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOopVJ39D8WDjcJEmWlUZYL1J9rLVJURjgaldZptndNq-UQVOGGZ2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the American Academy of Pediatrics says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are no miracle cures for measles,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, who chairs the academy's Committee on Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOorT8Sr9yjNVQdr2q9VZwpm0YYljuJGUDnKV-BWaft656gAsiHDC" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently said in a fact check on the organization's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recently said in a fact check on the organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. "If your child becomes sick with measles, doctors will do everything we can to care for them, but the truth is we do not have effective treatments against this viral infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nutrition and obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at an April 15 event in Indianapolis, said 70% of Americans are obese or overweight, compared to 3% of Americans during President John F. Kennedy's tenure in the early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Nearly three-quarters of Americans are overweight, including about 40% with obesity, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent figures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent figures&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. Between 1960 and 1962, about 13% of people in the U.S. had obesity, according to historic CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rise in obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries in recent decades has been well-documented and studied. Experts say there is no single explanation for the increase, but that it stems from a combination of factors, including biological and environmental contributors, an increase in available calories and a decline in physical activity. Changes in the food supply, including the development of high-calorie, cheap ultraprocessed foods have been linked to obesity, but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-nih-kevin-hall-kennedy-b40b626771519f3f9a6546699491fc3b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exactly how these foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exactly how these foods&lt;/a&gt; affect weight gain remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY at April 10 cabinet meeting regarding food dyes: “We’ve shown now that this directly affects academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: &lt;a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/report/health-effects-assessment-potential-neurobehavioral-effects-synthetic-food-dyes-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recent research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows synthetic food colors common in U.S. foods are linked to neurobehavioral problems in children and that the dyes may cause or exacerbate symptoms, particularly hyperactivity. In addition, children may vary widely in their sensitivity to the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is clear that some children are likely to be more adversely affected by food dyes than others," researchers in California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment reported in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those responses have the potential to affect school work and behaviors such as aggression, but to date there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between food dyes and academic performance, violence or other mental and physical conditions, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To date, scientific evidence shows that “most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY on March 28 during a speech in West Virginia to encourage restrictions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: “Twenty years ago, there was no diabetes in China. Today 50% of the population is diabetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Diabetes prevalence has gone up in China over the past two decades, driven by rising living standards, urbanization and an aging population.

Because intermittent fasting doesn’t typically require monitoring calories or changing what you eat, it can feel easier to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZXZ7ROZORBK3DA3X4367CW6EA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Interest in the practice took off in the last decade or so, after experiments in animals showed that eating restricted to certain times had a profound impact on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30174302/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25470548/" target="_blank"&gt;the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. But in people, the weight-loss benefits linked to intermittent fasting may be because they took in less food in general — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9407646/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 550 fewer calories per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WHWIR5RJJB5BFUZVDUQBUNXVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both intermittent fasting and overall calorie restriction approaches can result in weight loss for a few months, but they are very hard to sustain; studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11192144/" target="_blank"&gt;some of that weight comes back&lt;/a&gt; after a year, regardless of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YL2XKAVZPFBRHNY6IPYRP7TXMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Given all these factors, intermittent fasting is not my go-to recommendation for healthy eating.

That means the control group was likely consuming more calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="KRZQ337LSNHHNGS77XNA5TP3ZM" data-apitype="header" level="5" id="KRZQ337LSNHHNGS77XNA5TP3ZM"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time-restricted eating&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3YR5WNCRGRBBVG54P7CGTU3P2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This approach involves fasting for a part of the day — say, 16 hours of a 24-hour cycle — and then eating only within the remaining window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JNTFMTEOSNBW3ICD4P7C4YXZSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11192144/" target="_blank"&gt;large study from last year&lt;/a&gt; found that time-restricted eating was just as effective as calorie-restricted diets for weight loss — about 10-12 pounds in both groups after 12 months. This study was notable because it included participants from a diverse American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FT2WWVUK7JFEBDGG2MKONN3MKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there are also potential risks: A widely publicized 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/18/intermittent-fasting-time-restricted-eating/" target="_blank"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; presented at an American Heart Association meeting indicated that an eight-hour time-restricted eating pattern was linked to a 91 percent higher risk of &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over a median of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QEKYV5UUAVGEBL5VBCDUSBNFJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most scientists would agree that this study raises questions but is not conclusive.

These studies can’t fully exclude the possibility that people who skip breakfast engage in other less healthy activities. But other benefits of eating breakfast, such as improved work performance and &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124320" target="_blank"&gt;an optimized circadian rhythm in the gut&lt;/a&gt;, are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WI32VWVO4BADBNPG75T6H73ZLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So my advice to intermittent-fasters — and everyone else — would be to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/23/healthy-breakfast-ideas-feel-full/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy breakfast&lt;/a&gt; every day and avoid late-night meals. The evidence shows that late-night snacking and eating &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7" target="_blank"&gt;impacts how we burn calories and store fat&lt;/a&gt;, putting us at greater risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="5Y7TRIWQKRHMLLRKI2H4YEUI64" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="5Y7TRIWQKRHMLLRKI2H4YEUI64"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there downsides to intermittent fasting?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P5P2FDDQO5AM3AT4KFSFHE6UAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of my patients who try intermittent fasting suffer from hanger — much like with any diet — and can also experience headaches or fatigue, at least in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAMMUZCFZNFBBBP2H5UD4TUCNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also important to consider how this approach can impact your social life. Meals are often what brings us together, and intermittent fasting can affect that. The risks and benefits are worth considering carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NY36GKNXKZBPTNLTBWGJXFDFHA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NY36GKNXKZBPTNLTBWGJXFDFHA"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I want my patients to know&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42VKRDSXXNFQFPXOJ47CYG7PZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Intermittent fasting has become popular as a lifestyle choice even among non-dieters: Limited studies in people have found that, for instance, intermittent fasting can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5990470/" target="_blank"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity and blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; regardless of weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VF562JQC5JGDPMAB7R3G5JNW54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But you should always run any big changes in your diet by your physician.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ryan Yuen, study author and senior scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Las Vegas, said: 'Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means essential proteins sapped away from DNA could be added back, repairing faulty genes and preventing further errors from appearing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.5776?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042125"&gt;another new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China found a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment may improve certain autism signs like trouble sleeping and issues with social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment, called transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) involves sending electrical impulses through electrodes that are placed on a patient's scalp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The signals coming through the electrodes are thought to increase brain activity in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children ages three to 14 who received 20 tPCS sessions over four weeks had 'significant' improvements in sleep, language, sensory issues and socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both studies come as the latest CDC data shows autism is on the rise in the US, affecting one in 31 children. This is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;staggering increase&lt;/a&gt; from one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many experts believe the rise is due to better screening and diagnostics, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14625349/autism-expert-likely-causes-america-surge-rfk-jr-toxin-cases.html"&gt;health authorities like Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; believe environmental factors like pesticides, food additives and ultrasound scans could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UNLV study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed RNA in 38 gene sets from people with and without autism. RNA is a key molecule that helps cells build proteins and function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that when the DMPK gene responsible for DM1 repeats, it creates 'toxic RNA' that binds to proteins involved in DNA production during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That 'toxic RNA' depletes the protein and prevents it from binding the other RNA molecules, causing a protein imbalance and errors in other surrounding genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yuen said: 'TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted both DM1, the muscle-weakening condition, and autism can both be caused by repetitions in the DMPK gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lukasz Sznajder, a research lead and assistant professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), said: 'A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DM1 leads to muscle weakness around the limbs and, as it progresses, vital organs like the heart and lungs. This leads to abnormal heart rhythms and breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear in adolescence or young adulthood and start with weakness around the muscles in the face, neck, fingers and ankles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects 140,000 Americans and the life expectancy is around 48 to 55 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors said more research is needed connecting DM1 to autism, but the group is planning to look at if these DNA errors are occurring in other genes that have been associated with autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also received FDA approval for a similar stem cell therapy to enter clinical trials for &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), another neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These regulatory steps “[pave] the way for these therapies to advance into clinical trials in the United States and [lay] the foundation for future commercialization in the global market,” Xellsmart’s CEO and founder Xiang Li, PhD, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xellsmarts-allogeneic-ipsc-derived-cell-therapies-for-parkinsons-disease-and-als-officially-approved-by-the-us-fda-for-phase-i-clinical-trials-302427583.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ongoing clinical trial of XS-411 in Parkinson’s patients in China, where Xellsmart is based, has so far reported a reduction of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and no adverse events related to the treatment, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s disease, the loss of nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical transmitter essential for motor function, leads to tremors, slowed movement, and a range of both &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. XS-411 is designed to replace these damaged cells, potentially alleviating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What is XS-411 and how does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy utilizes induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a versatile type of cell that can be developed into nearly any other cell type in the lab. Researchers can differentiate iPSCs into dopaminergic neurons, which are then injected into the brain. If successfully integrated, these new dopamine-producing neurons may help restore some of the function lost as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XS-411 uses allogeneic iPSCs derived from third-party donors, rather than from the patients themselves. This approach &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9906386/"&gt;allows for the mass production of stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and the development of an “off-the-shelf” product that can be readily available for multiple patients. While autologous iPSCs, that is, those derived from the patient, can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025001091#sec0005"&gt;help minimize the risk of immune rejection&lt;/a&gt;, allogeneic iPSCs offer the advantage of scalability and the potential for more accessible, standardized treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XS-411 has shown initial safety and efficacy in a clinical trial in China, according to Xellsmart. In the study, cells were injected into the striatal putamen, a brain area affected by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, in patients with moderate or moderate to severe Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six to 12 months of follow-up, the participants haven’t reported complications related to the therapy, according to the company. All those treated showed significant improvements in key measures, such as increased on time, which is when symptoms are adequately controlled, and reduced motor and nonmotor symptoms, as reflected by lower scores in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company believes the results support XS-411’s further development. “XellSmart remains firmly committed to providing allogeneic, off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived regenerative cell therapies to patients with [central nervous system] diseases worldwide,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work by students Emmie Casey and Tomi Kuye, supported by Rice’s &lt;a href="https://oedk.rice.edu/#gsc.tab=0"&gt;Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; (OEDK), builds on a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.624317/full"&gt;small Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt; that found coordinated, vibratory stimuli delivered daily to the fingertips improved patients’ motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to take this breakthrough and make it accessible to people who would never be able to afford an expensive medical device,” Casey said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-students-develop-low-cost-vibrotactile-glove-help-treat-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. “We set out to design a glove that delivers the same therapeutic vibrations but at a fraction of the cost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the loss of neurons in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical that is essential for nerve cell communication and motor control. When dopamine levels drop, patients may experience tremors, stiffness, slowed movements, and problems with balance and walking. These &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are partly due to abnormal, overly synchronized firing patterns in motor-related brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier work at Stanford University found that wearing a glove that vibrates between 100 and 300 times per second, for about two hours twice a day, can help break up that synchronization and ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;‘Not just masking symptoms’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casey and Kuye worked up a lower-cost prototype, and they said the first reactions have been positive. One early version, made for a friend’s mother who has early-onset Parkinson’s, showed some surprising results. “After about six months of wearing the gloves regularly, she was able to walk unaided,” Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their prototype uses the vibration motors found in wearables and smartphones, instead of the expensive ones used in other designs. Each fingertip of a soft, wireless glove has its own vibration motor, all powered by a custom circuit board placed on the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This glove is designed to stimulate the Pacinian corpuscles within the fingertips to help resynchronize the neurons within the brain that cause tremors and stiffness,” Kuye said. A Pacinian corpuscle is a nerve ending that can sense pressure and vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not just masking symptoms. We’re aiming to actually retrain this part of the brain,” said Kuye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the students are “not claiming it’s a cure,” Kuye said, “if it can give people just a little more control, a little more freedom, that’s life changing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casey and Kuye are developing a commercial version of the glove that will sell for about $250, and have started a nonprofit to use sliding-scale pricing based on what patients can afford. They’re &lt;a href="https://kinnections.foundation"&gt;taking preorders&lt;/a&gt; and accepting donations to help get the first 500 pairs out by this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students also shared &lt;a href="https://oedk.wildapricot.org/Treatment-Glove"&gt;free instructions online&lt;/a&gt; so anyone can build their own gloves. While soldering, 3D printing, and light sewing are recommended, the instructions note that the soldering joints are simple, the 3D printed parts can be ordered, and a stapler or fashion tape can be used instead of sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Casey and Kuye are working on getting approval to test usability — that is, how well the gloves fit for use — and they’re planning to team up with people at the Texas Medical Center in Houston to test how effective the gloves are with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This project exemplifies what we strive for at the OEDK — empowering students to translate cutting-edge research into real-world solutions,” said Maria Oden, PhD, a professor of bioengineering and director of the OEDK, who supervised the work along with Heather Bisesti, an engineering design professor at Rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oden, who is also co-director of the &lt;a href="https://rice360.rice.edu"&gt;Rice 360 Institute for Global Health Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, said the students “have shown extraordinary initiative and empathy in developing a device that could bring meaningful relief to people living with Parkinson’s, no matter their resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, it helps lower cholesterol levels, which contributes to general cardiovascular well-being, which is another way in which it improves heart health. Because of this, it is not only a supplement for weight loss, but it is also a product that promotes general health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem: Step-by-Step Working!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an effort to facilitate healthy and efficient weight loss, the formula is intended to preserve the body's ketosis in a state&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than carbohydrates and calories, this condition allows the body to rely on adipose cells as an energy source. With the goal to simplify this function and provide the body with an adequate amount of energy, &lt;strong&gt;the formula is comprised of natural forms of natural BHB molecules&lt;/strong&gt;. It improves digestion, alleviates inflammation, and resets metabolic function. A new wave of interest in plant-based, science-based solutions has been ignited by this early morning habit. It lowering appetite, enhancing physical performance rates, clearing brain fog, supplying energy, and so lowering inflammation and oxidative stress damage, &lt;strong&gt;the Lipozem formula also helps the users to burn that additional fat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wyoQG-ly14Qd5Owbk2YfVIqK2iORivBhBW_1ikFE7yXNIWjkT-241oQZIuDtCs-4YcLc8pyl-V12njj7_V8rd3CiRwx-ElRthF2Jdp_1ZK9nrs9tuFHtOHScghYOM2DLQbEh8XVGTzptKbflGDlCt7HlmYi-1dkvGEfg4rxZyuGnG6NlRu7fCjIUl9DXunkP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTHING TO LOSE: “LIPOZEM” OFFERS 60-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power-Packed Ingredients of LIPOZEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the natural components that are included in the &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; recipe is essential since these components are the ones that are accountable for the effective burning of fat in individuals who use the product. &lt;strong&gt;As a result of Lipozem's ability to enhance digestion, promote fat burning, and speed up metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, it is able to accomplish a synergistic impact. In the following list, you will discover a potent component!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Beta Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;during the process of the body transitioning into a low-carb state, a molecule known as magnesium BHB is created. &lt;strong&gt;By modulating hormones, this provides the body with the ability to burn fat cells for fuel rather than carbohydrates, which in turn helps to lower appetite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-xjBRSoD-CfuRh7h12aEqq4WdCrOj2ZEpmrpaHrnA3oRscjYyJU7Z7S5hr26FW-D_2Qk0vPlqGaXSd59E72XxBJ53pqaN7uo0cs5eex5dXyPsUypFLBRarsVtANtZWBbFTAZ8OKJcZf1dfzUXAlSP-rpuDG8U15YY5XQTlQaZxVNF0DyyldJzAI4vida3CAZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium Beta Hydroxybutyrate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Due to the fact that it helps stabilize blood sugar levels and boosts energy levels, sodium BHB is vital for individuals who suffer energy troughs or who have issues with the management of blood sugar. The glucose level in the blood can also be brought back to normal, which is another advantage. With the support of this addition, the body is able to maintain high levels of energy throughout the course of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2vD3P6JjnWYgXuoeXXOv_JNKcl8C8sBppH_OGUjnyxqxIXDoqq7fKrq_RJkvz-kXH8Z_0XpfoADPCBF5NGNG2VfJE-gKs6v1zfPrrCK0ksAj-R9EztIMdwM5AbfgrfGo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Calcium BHB"&gt;Calcium BHB&lt;/a&gt; is an element that helps the body transition into a low-carb state more smoothly and decreases the negative impacts of this transition. In addition to promoting improved cognitive capabilities, it helps reduce inflammation and the damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem Benefits That Make a Difference between Other Products!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A great number of advantages are made available to you as a result of the fact that it is an entirely pure product, with each and every component being pure.

It is designed to help people lose weight in an effective and long-lasting manner. One of the primary goals of the dietary supplement &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem is to assist individuals in increasing their fat burning and weight loss&lt;/strong&gt;. In most cases, it is composed of a wide range of naturally occurring components, including calcium and salt, in addition to a number of additional compounds that either stimulate thermogenesis or speed up the metabolic reactions. &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; is commonly sold as a quick treatment for persons who have sluggish metabolisms or stubborn body fat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer may have somewhat varying formulations, but the product is frequently touted as a rapid fix. One more research stated that In addition to providing a little boost in energy and assisting in the decrease of cravings, this combination of natural appetite suppressants and fat burners may also be able to sustain a calorie deficit that ultimately leads to weight loss. The use of &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; may be beneficial for those who struggle with fat that is either trapped or plateauing, particularly in the waist region.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping It Up: Is Lipozem Worth for You?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a lot of potential for Lipozem as a weight loss tablet because it has a lot of benefits that go beyond just burning fat&lt;/strong&gt;. Through the use of its natural components, it improves digestion, increases energy levels, suppresses hunger, and controls metabolism. It is a perfect complement to health since it benefits the cardiovascular system much more than it already does. It has been determined that the formula provides support for the cognitive talents and functions of the user.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who is looking for a chemical that is completely natural and safe to use in order to assist with weight control will find that &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; offers a comprehensive solution.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the body of a patient, a small clump of cells, growing undetected, has begun to form a tumor. It has yet to cause pain or visible symptoms of illness. Several months from now, or perhaps years, those first signs will prompt a doctor's inquiry, a referral to a specialist, and an eventual diagnosis. Treatment will depend on how long the cancer has gone unnoticed and how far it has spread.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There were early signs, though not ones the patient or doctor could have noticed. Small fragments of RNA, cast off from dying cells or spit out of the tumor's twisted transcriptions, floating about in the bloodstream—early signals of a tissue in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new method developed by Stanford researchers aims to bring the moment of detection much closer to the beginning. They have developed a blood-based method called RARE-seq that detects tumor-derived cell-free RNA with around 50 times the sensitivity of standard sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq showed an ability to identify lung cancer signatures in patients at various disease stages, outperforming commonly used DNA-based approaches. RNA from vaccines and many transcripts associated with non-cancer-related conditions were also detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-based liquid biopsies offer a non-invasive approach to capture cancer-related changes by identifying circulating tumor DNA. This allows early detection, genotyping, and monitoring of disease, even when specific tumor locations are unknown or would require surgical biopsy to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell-free RNA, fragments of RNA released into the bloodstream by dying or active cells, presents a broader diagnostic view of gene activity throughout the body. Detection requires precision because most RNA circulating in the bloodstream originates from blood-forming cells rather than tumors. Rare tumor-derived RNA molecules are often masked by the background signal of these hematopoietic transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In the study, "An ultrasensitive method for detection of cell-free RNA," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08834-1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed RARE-seq (random priming and affinity capture of cell-free RNA fragments for enrichment analysis by sequencing), a method optimized for the detection of cell-free RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples analyzed in the study included 437 plasma collections from 369 individuals. Participants represented a range of cancer stages, non-malignant conditions, and healthy controls drawn from multiple clinical centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers optimized the full experimental workflow for analyzing cell-free RNA in plasma. Pre-analytical variables such as blood collection, RNA extraction, and sample storage were systematically evaluated to reduce variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps in library preparation were adapted for low RNA input, including enzymatic removal of contaminating DNA, improved complementary DNA synthesis, and end-repair protocols to enhance efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central feature of the method involves selective enrichment of transcripts using a capture panel during library preparation. Researchers used molecular probes to isolate 4,737 rare abundance genes and 50 housekeeping genes. These genes were selected because they are typically low or absent in healthy plasma and are more likely to reflect tissue-specific or disease-related RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; was developed to eliminate expression noise caused by residual platelet RNA. This model identified gene patterns linked to platelet contamination and adjusted for them using data from healthy reference samples.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;RARE-seq detected expression signatures associated with non-small-cell lung cancer in 101 out of 139 participants with previously confirmed lung cancer. Detection rates increased by cancer stage, with 30% in stage I, 63% in stage II, 67% in stage III, and 83% in stage IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a head-to-head comparison using matched plasma samples, RARE-seq identified cancer in 34% of cases that were missed by ctDNA analysis, while no samples were detected by ctDNA alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq also identified somatic driver mutations in 28% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma as well as 1% of controls. Known variants such as EGFR, KRAS, and RET were among those detected through RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq revealed cell-free RNA expression profiles associated with histological transformation, MET amplification, and drug resistance in patients treated with EGFR-targeting therapies. In one patient, cell-free RNA markers of small-cell transformation diminished following chemotherapy, reflecting a shift in tumor state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For samples unrelated to cancer, RNA from mRNA vaccines was detected for up to six weeks after administration. Transcripts linked to COVID-19 infection, lung injury, and mechanical ventilation were also found, particularly in individuals with recent tobacco exposure or active pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this preliminary validation, RARE-seq achieved levels of detection sensitivity beyond those of current ctDNA-based methods, identifying tumor-derived RNA at extremely low concentrations. Detection of gene activity patterns and cancer-related mutations from a single blood sample enabled detailed molecular characterization of lung tumors and resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results imply a much broader utility for cell-free RNA analysis in both cancer and non-cancer conditions. RARE-seq introduces a foundation for future blood tests that capture gene expression changes in a wide range of clinical scenarios. Diagnostic use will require clinical trials in early-stage &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and expanded reference datasets for cell-free RNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been a suspect in dementia. Some studies have hinted at a correlation between lower blood pressure and fewer dementia cases, but they were too small and too short to lend statistical significance to the link. It’s also been noted that people with untreated high blood pressure carry a 42% higher risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP3869588X1A85522C2ADE48719455668AF40B97CDYI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41591-025-03616-8&amp;amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study published Monday in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reports that intensive blood pressure control lowered the risk of dementia by 15% and cognitive impairment by 16%. The large, cluster-randomized trial in rural China once again illuminated the role of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/02/hypertension-u-s-china-village-doctors-dan-jones/"&gt;“village doctors,”&lt;/a&gt; the local term for community health workers, who outdid usual care. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an incredibly important study,” Dan Jones, a past president of the American Heart Association, told STAT. He was not involved in the new research. “Here’s something tangible that now we can tell our patients. This is so important for motivating people to control their blood pressure, and treating it intensively as well.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial included nearly 34,000 people age 40 and older in rural China who had untreated hypertension. Just over half of the people received care from community health workers who started them on blood pressure medications, adjusting the drugs and the doses as needed to reach a goal of bringing blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg. These non-physicians also gave participants discounted or free antihypertensive medications and coached them on home blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle changes (such as weight loss, reducing dietary sodium, and limiting alcohol), and medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Whole villages were in either the intervention group or the control group, whose members received usual care from their health care providers to reach a more modest target blood pressure of below 140/90 mm Hg. People who got more intensive guidance in the intervention villages took an average of three different blood pressure drugs, compared to one that people in the control villages were given.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After four years, the intervention group achieved better blood pressure control as well as a 15% reduction in dementia and a 16% reduction in cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first to report a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all-cause dementia associated with antihypertensive treatment, providing strong evidence to support its use for the primary prevention of dementia,” study author Jiang He, a physician and professor of epidemiology at UT Southwestern, told STAT in an email. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The non-physician community health care providers have garnered attention before for their success at controlling blood pressure and reducing risk for cardiovascular disease. Well-trained but not M.D.s, they’ve helped thousands of people living with high blood pressure in rural regions, studies in the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00325-7/abstract#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2820165?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2024.1463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 focused on cardiovascular risk have said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Village doctors are seen as key players in places with lower income, Jones wrote in an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2820166" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; that appeared with the JAMA Cardiology paper.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This focus on low-resource settings would be a comprehensible recommendation if hypertension control rates were much better in high-resource settings, such as in the U.S. This is not the case. Might it be that this simple approach would be useful not only in low-resource settings but in high-resource settings as well?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of American adults have blood pressure higher than 130/80 mm Hg, three-quarters of whom do not have it under control, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. Much like the village doctors in China, community health workers lowered blood pressure among certain populations in New York, this &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.009321" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated. But an effort  in Maryland and Pennsylvania had mixed results, a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069622" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next research steps might be longer studies in different populations with more frequent cognitive assessments, the paper’s authors and outside experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging that the intervention worked in real-world, rural settings using non-physician healthcare workers. However, this four-year study cannot tell us whether the benefits will last in the long-term,”  Richard Oakley, associate director of research and innovation at the U.K.’s Alzheimer’s Society, said in a statement. “Although no single behaviour is guaranteed to prevent dementia, we know that what’s good for your heart is often also good for your head.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s strength in establishing cause and effects helps solidify what’s been advanced before as a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would take a lot of money, a lot of years, but I think if you take the results of this study and extrapolate to what it might mean for younger and middle-aged patients, the impact could really be astounding,” Jones said. “But you have to do the studies to know that for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about half of cases&lt;/a&gt; could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 risk factors including hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and social isolation – as well as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers say tackling the last of these could reduce the risk of dementia by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Antihypertensive treatment can prevent dementia in patients with uncontrolled hypertension,” said Prof Jiang He, the co-author of the study, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Given the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension worldwide, this effective intervention should be widely adopted and scaled up to reduce the global burden of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03616-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers in China and the US reported how the trial involved 33,995 people aged 40 years and over with uncontrolled high blood pressure, spread across 326 villages in rural China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team randomly selected 163 of these villages, with the 17,407 participants who lived there given intensive blood pressure management from non-physician community healthcare providers, often called “village doctors”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This included free or cheap medications to lower blood pressure, given at tailored doses, health coaching to help them stick to medications and lifestyle modifications – such as weight loss, alcohol reduction and reducing salt intake – and equipment and instructions to monitor blood pressure at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The other 163 villages – encompassing 16,588 participants – received “usual care” – meaning participants’ blood pressure was managed in their normal clinical settings. While lifestyle changes were recommended and some took blood pressure-lowering drugs, this group did not receive free at-home blood pressure monitors or medications, or coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers followed up with the participants after four years, they found 668 of those in the intensive blood pressure management group had dementia, compared with 734 in the usual care group – with analyses suggesting the former group had a 15% lower risk of dementia. Further work revealed this group had a 16% lower risk of cognitive impairment without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the team noted that the cognitive function of participants was not assessed at the start of the study, they said the similarity of participants in the two groups means this is unlikely to skew the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Amid all the warnings about a ‘dementia tsunami’, here are the things you should know | Devi Sridhar","elementId":"a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/08/warnings-dementia-tsunami-research-hope"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, Prof Joanna Wardlaw, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the study could not unpick the relative contribution of optimal blood-pressure control and lifestyle changes on the reduction in dementia risk, suggesting the results reflected a combined effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others said similar research should now be carried out with longer follow-up periods, and added that the approach also needed to be trialled in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said the research “provides further strong evidence supporting the importance of managing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks to protect the brain during ageing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, she added: “It is important to note that treating high blood pressure was not a foolproof guarantee as some people receiving treatment still developed dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNSWVkM1VvbXVod1pSdkhLY2pwdXR5THVOUHB4TWVKZVE4S21xTmhLNDU3WHJHRDJNR1EzV2V0QTZuOXBUSWRodlRickZoOXE2bW5xWGRMNTFpSVMtdmw0SkxCOFpxYkhNeXJCU2NvTFJqT294UHdMZjBDSTJDZ1VXUjhCRGdjTTZ6TVlYWDdvWFhVTjVGcDVoSXN5dXpFMEhzYXprUnFZa25qRkZZVzgzWWo5dUp2UQ</guid></item><item><title>降低高血压的5种有效方法-印度快报 | 5 effective ways to lower high blood pressure - The Indian Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block"&gt;&lt;img class="lazyloading" decoding="async" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg" data-lazy-type="lazyloading-image" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-lazy-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as a 15-minute walk around your home or up the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/posture-climb-stairs-avoid-joint-pain-expert-9869705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even just 10 minutes after a meal can make a significant difference in your blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose protein over carbs for breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap plain oatmeal for Greek yoghurt with berries and oats! A protein-packed breakfast keeps you fuller for longer and helps stabilise blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="osv-ad-class"&gt;

					&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ATF_1X1" class="ad-slot"&gt;
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for five grams of fiber per meal or snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibre is key. Try to get 25-30 grams daily by adding fibre-rich foods like berries in the morning, a high-fibre smoothie for lunch, and plenty of vegetables with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise 7-9 hours of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep regulates your blood sugar. Set a consistent bedtime &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/walking-exercise-fitness-health-guide-duration-9392836/" class="" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and ditch social media an hour before bed to improve your sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress effectively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce cortisol (stress hormone) by finding what works for you—whether it’s tapping, walking, reading, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee. Less stress, more balance, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_1_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To verify and assess the efficacy of these viral tips, we consulted an expert. Here’s what we learnt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can following these measures really help you lower your blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant in internal medicine at Gleneagles Hospital Parel, &lt;a rel="noamphtml" class="keywordtourl" href="https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, agreed that adequate sleep and stress management help tackle blood pressure. “Try to manage your stress levels effectively while adding simple changes to your daily lifestyle. Focus more on doing things that help you stay calm. This can include deep breathing, meditation, going for a walk, listening to music, watching your favourite movie, or as simple as just lying down on your sofa,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also shared that including fibre and choosing protein over carbohydrates helps with weight management, which can help you feel more satiated and improve your exercise results. “This can help keep your blood pressure levels in check. Individuals are advised to incorporate various exercises or physical activities like yoga, stretching, brisk walking, cycling, swimming, cardio, or strength training in their daily lifestyle for at least 30 to 50 minutes a day,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a sedentary lifestyle, you are more susceptible to high blood pressure, said Dr Agarwal. “Ensure you take out time to move through the day, and especially after a few minutes of your meals for at least 10 minutes,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_2_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, she also emphasized the importance of eating a healthy diet and avoiding oily or junk foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are someone who actively smokes or drinks alcohol, then you should try to curb this habit. Too much alcohol or smoking can contribute to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/this-is-what-happens-to-your-blood-pressure-when-you-add-magnesium-to-your-diet-9722921/" class="" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Quitting smoking or drinking completely can help protect your overall health,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="id_newsletter_subscription" class="ev-meter-content" data-slug="express-sunday-eye" data-bottom="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;Media Advisory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-21T11:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Monday, April 21, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Annual Report to the Nation: Cancer deaths continue to decline&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Overall death rates from cancer declined steadily among both men and women from 2001 through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall death rates from cancer declined steadily among both men and women from 2001 through 2022, even during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer. Among men, overall cancer incidence, measured as the rate of new cancer diagnoses, decreased from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021. Among women, overall cancer incidence increased slightly every year from 2003 through 2021, with the exception of 2020. The report appeared April 21, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Cancer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in reducing cancer deaths overall is largely the result of declines in both incidence and death rates for lung cancer and several other smoking-related cancers, the researchers noted. New diagnoses and deaths from lung cancer, for example, have declined in both men and women over the past 20 years. Meanwhile, the incidence of cancers associated with obesity has been rising. These include female breast, uterus, colon and rectum, pancreas, kidney, and liver cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also shows that new diagnoses of breast cancer gradually increased over the study period, but the overall breast cancer death rate decreased. Cancer death rates in children declined steadily over the study period; those for adolescents and young adults also declined until recently, when the decline slowed and stabilized. From 2018 to 2022, cancer deaths decreased for each major racial and ethnic population group. From 2017 to 2021 (excluding 2020), cancer incidence was stable among men in each major racial and ethnic population group but increased among women in each major racial and ethnic population group. During the same time period, among men, incidence was highest in non-Hispanic Black men, whereas among women, incidence was highest in American Indian and Alaska Native women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also included an analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on observed cancer incidence in individual states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for the first two years of the pandemic. Cancer incidence declined sharply in 2020, likely due to pandemic-related disruptions in health care, but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. The magnitude of the 2020 decline was similar across states, despite variations in COVID-19 policy restrictions. The researchers noted that these findings underscore the importance of providing access to health care, even during public health emergencies, to ensure the timely diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer is a collaborative effort among the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the American Cancer Society (ACS); and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).The report provides annual updates on cancer trends in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is based on cancer incidence data from population-based cancer registries, funded by CDC and NCI and compiled by NAACCR, and on cancer death data from the National Center for Health Statistics’ National Vital Statistics System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of people a year could benefit from so-called voice prosthesis. Their cognitive functions remain more or less intact, but they have suffered speech loss due to stroke, the neurodegenerative disorder ALS, and other brain conditions. If successful, researchers hope the technique could be extended to help people who have difficulty vocalizing because of conditions such as cerebral palsy or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of voice neuroprosthesis is beginning to trigger interest among businesses. Precision Neuroscience claims to be capturing higher resolution brain signals than academic researchers, since the electrodes of its implants are more densely packed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has worked with 31 patients and plans soon to collect data from more, providing a potential pathway to commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision received regulatory clearance on April 17 to leave its sensors implanted for up to 30 days at a time. That would enable its scientists to train their system with what could within a year be the “largest repository of high resolution neural data that exists on planet Earth,” said chief executive Michael Mager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step would be to “miniaturize the components and put them in hermetically sealed packages that are biocompatible so they can be planted in the body forever,” Mager said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink, the best-known brain-computer interface (BCI) company, has focused on enabling people with paralysis to control computers rather than giving them a synthetic voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important obstacle to the development of brain-to-voice technology is the time patients take to learn how to use the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key unanswered question is how much the response patterns in the motor cortex—the part of the brain that controls voluntary actions, including speech—vary between people. If they remained very similar, machine-learning models trained on previous individuals could be used for new patients, said Nick Ramsey, a BCI researcher at University Medical Centre Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="" data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman, has become a living example of what’s possible when you challenge conventional ideas about aging. Once a modest baker, Morgan now stands as a four-time world rowing champion, a remarkable achievement considering he only picked up the sport at the age of 70. His story not only inspires but also offers valuable insights into healthy aging, as a recent study of his fitness and lifestyle was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5953"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="589" data-end="827"&gt;Morgan’s case has caught the attention of both scientists and fitness enthusiasts. His story provides hard evidence that aging doesn’t have to mean a decline in &lt;strong data-start="750" data-end="760"&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong data-start="764" data-end="775"&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s possible to defy the odds, even later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="829" data-end="855"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="832" data-end="855"&gt;A Body Half His Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="857" data-end="1265"&gt;What makes Morgan’s fitness truly extraordinary is how his body compares to someone much younger. Researchers have found that his &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="998" data-end="1013"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="1019" data-end="1036"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/strong&gt; align more closely with those of a man in his forties. Weighing in at 76 kilograms, Morgan boasts an impressive 80% muscle mass and only 15% body fat. For someone his age, his cardiovascular and muscular health is extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1267" data-end="1608"&gt;For example, during a &lt;strong data-start="1289" data-end="1316"&gt;2,000-meter rowing test&lt;/strong&gt;, Morgan’s heart rate peaked at an impressive 153 beats per minute—an intensity more typically seen in athletes several decades younger. This remarkable physical condition isn’t just about &lt;strong data-start="1505" data-end="1522"&gt;good genetics&lt;/strong&gt;; it’s the result of a well-rounded &lt;strong data-start="1558" data-end="1578"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong data-start="1585" data-end="1607"&gt;nutrient-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1610" data-end="1912"&gt;As &lt;strong data-start="1613" data-end="1629"&gt;Scott Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, points out, “The body’s ability to adapt to exercise doesn’t fade with age.” This insight underscores Morgan’s exceptional fitness and proves that it’s not just about luck or age but rather a consistent effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="At 93, He Looks 40?! The Fitness Secret That Defies Aging!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofODzzgGl70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1914" data-end="1949"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1917" data-end="1949"&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1951" data-end="2226"&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of Morgan’s fitness journey is that he didn’t start his athletic pursuits until his seventies. His late start has sparked interest among scientists studying the body’s ability to adapt to intense physical activity, even at an advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="2228" data-end="2458"&gt;“The idea that aging equals inevitable decline is a myth,” says &lt;strong data-start="2292" data-end="2310"&gt;Bas Van Hooren&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at Maastricht University. “Morgan’s transformation shows that it’s possible to build a strong and resilient body even later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2460" data-end="2805"&gt;This is a powerful reminder that it’s never too late to begin a journey toward better health. &lt;strong data-start="2554" data-end="2575"&gt;Strength training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="2580" data-end="2600"&gt;proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; are key to slowing down, or even reversing, the muscle mass loss often associated with aging. According to &lt;strong data-start="2708" data-end="2718"&gt;Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, the human body still retains the ability to respond to exercise, even in older years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2807" data-end="2846"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2810" data-end="2846"&gt;Richard Morgan’s Fitness Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2848" data-end="2993"&gt;So, what does it take for Morgan to maintain a body as fit as someone half his age? His routine is &lt;strong data-start="2947" data-end="2966"&gt;straightforward&lt;/strong&gt; but undoubtedly demanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="2995" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="2995" data-end="3042"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;40 minutes of rowing several times a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3043" data-end="3074"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;Regular strength training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3075" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3077" data-end="3182"&gt;A &lt;strong data-start="3079" data-end="3100"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/strong&gt;, far exceeding the daily recommended intake of 60 grams for someone of his weight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3184" data-end="3501"&gt;Morgan’s high-protein diet plays a critical role in maintaining and building muscle mass. As &lt;strong data-start="3277" data-end="3295"&gt;Philip Jakeman&lt;/strong&gt;, a professor of &lt;strong data-start="3312" data-end="3329"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="3334" data-end="3358"&gt;physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of Limerick, highlights, “Exercise combined with proper nutrition allows us to build and maintain a strong body at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3503" data-end="3887"&gt;For Morgan, each aspect of his routine works in tandem to keep his body functioning at an elite level. &lt;strong data-start="3606" data-end="3616"&gt;Rowing&lt;/strong&gt; helps with cardiovascular health, &lt;strong data-start="3651" data-end="3672"&gt;strength training&lt;/strong&gt; ensures muscle maintenance, and a &lt;strong data-start="3707" data-end="3728"&gt;protein-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt; supports overall vitality. His regimen not only defies aging but sets a powerful example of how lifestyle choices can impact health well into our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3889" data-end="3921"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3892" data-end="3921"&gt;A Lesson in Healthy Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3923" data-end="4323"&gt;Richard Morgan’s story is a clear testament that age need not dictate our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-perfect-water-heater-temperature-to-save-money-without-health-risks/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. His success reveals that a combination of &lt;strong data-start="4047" data-end="4067"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="4069" data-end="4088"&gt;smart nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;, and a willingness to start—even late in life—can lead to remarkable outcomes. By challenging outdated beliefs about aging, Morgan proves that it’s possible to stay physically fit and mentally sharp well into the later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4325" data-end="4643"&gt;As Morgan continues to impress with his feats in the world of rowing, his story encourages us to prioritize health and fitness at any age. His life serves as a powerful reminder: with the right approach, we can all build a &lt;strong data-start="4548" data-end="4563"&gt;strong body&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong data-start="4567" data-end="4583"&gt;healthy mind&lt;/strong&gt;, and a future filled with vitality—no matter when we start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment also lessened missed work time, reduced work efficiency, and overall work impairment due to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), according to the researchers. TITAN participants whose condition improved with treatment tended to work more hours than those who remained stable or worsened, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tysabri infusion also was found to improve life quality for the RRMS patients taking part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall work impairment and overall activity impairment decreased with [Tysabri] treatment, and people with MS on [Tysabri] reported reduced physical and psychologic impact of MS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40120-025-00725-x"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact of Natalizumab on Productivity and Ability to Work in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in France: The TITAN Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Significant improvements seen for patients at 6, 12 and 18 months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is an inflammatory condition marked by damage to certain parts of the brain and spinal cord, resulting in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as walking difficulties, numbness and tingling, pain, excessive fatigue, and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the condition can arise at any age, MS most commonly manifests in people between the ages of 20 and 40, a time when most adults are working. Accordingly, most MS patients in France — 8 of every 10 in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1352458517708125"&gt;one study in the country&lt;/a&gt; — reported that the condition negatively impacted their work productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt;, known as DMTs, have &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/89/11/1200"&gt;positively impacted the working ability&lt;/a&gt; of people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of researchers in France specifically launched TITAN to gauge the impact of the DMT Tysabri on the work productivity of employed adults with RRMS. &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.com/"&gt;Biogen&lt;/a&gt;, the company that markets the medicine, sponsored the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 162 RRMS patients in the study were receiving Tysabri for the first time or had been given no more than one treatment infusion before the study. The mean age of the participants was 36.8, and slightly more than three-quarters were women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year before starting Tysabri, most patients (80.6%) experienced relapses, with about half (48.1%) reporting one relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, “significant improvement was seen in overall activity impairment” — meaning impairments were lessened — at six months, one year, and 1.5 years after starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Psychological impact of RRMS seen to ease with Tysabri infusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted that the number of working hours markedly dropped from Tysabri initiation through one year of treatment, during the time of the COVID-19 lockdown in the country (mean 1,224.9 vs. 808.3 hours), demonstrating a drop in “annual mean … productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Work productivity after the lockdown was substantially decreased, suggesting that this reduction in productivity at 12 months [the primary outcome] may be related to the lockdown,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with stable disease, as assessed by scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), working hours per year decreased by 76.9 after one year of Tysabri and by 315 hours among those with worsening disability. Conversely, patients with less disability worked 190.7 hours more per year after starting Tysabri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with sick leave related to MS in the year before Tysabri, the annual productivity remained stable the year after (mean 1,298 vs. 1,247 hours). At 12 months, the proportion of patients who took at least one period of sick leave was similar to before treatment (64.2% vs. 66%), but was higher among those who took at least three sick leave periods (19.1% vs. 10.5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year of Tysabri significantly attenuated time missed from work (mean 25.3% vs. 17%), reduced work efficiency (mean 25.2% vs. 18.4%), overall work impairment (mean 26.4% vs. 19.1%), and overall activity impairment (mean 37% vs. 26.3%), as measured by the WPAI-MS questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;These findings suggest that early treatment with [Tysabri] may improve the work function of patients with MS, thereby decreasing the economic burden of the disease and improving patient quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quality of life measures, the psychological impact of RRMS lessened after 12 months of Tysabri, as indicated by a drop in scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (mean 31.8 vs. 26.7 points). Physical impact scores also improved (mean 19.4 vs. 16.7 points). As assessed with the EQ-5D-3L, quality of life scores remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical measures, the number of relapses per year significantly decreased before and after Tysabri (1.2 vs. 0.1). While EDSS scores for disability improved overall with Tysabri, there was no change in EDSS scores for most patients (77.4%) after one year of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, within six months of starting on Tysabri infusion, “patients in France reported improved work function, as noted by decreases in absenteeism, … overall work impairment, and overall activity impairment. … These improvements were maintained at 18 months of follow-up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the team concluded, “these findings suggest that early treatment with [Tysabri] may improve the work function of patients with MS, thereby decreasing the economic burden of the disease and improving patient quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

chemical levels, said Miriam Diamond, a study co-author and environmental chemist at the University of Toronto. One mattress’s weight was 3% flame retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses,” Diamond said. “The kids are getting quite a dose of this stuff.” The study was done in partnership with the Green Science Policy Institute in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates and flame retardants are classes of chemicals with compounds linked to serious health issues like cancer, reproductive harm, genital malformation, neurological damage, hormonal disruption and early puberty. Exposure to some types of flame retardants is strongly linked to lower IQs in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates are typically used as plasticizers that help materials bend, and are added to plastic mattress covers, but they were also detected in non-plastic covers, which surprised the authors, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some types of phthalates are restricted for use in children’s products in the US because of their high toxicity, and the levels in four mattresses exceeded those. No limits exist for other concerning phthalate compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;UV filters are added to textiles to prevent dyes from deteriorating, and research has increasingly raised concerns about potential health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mattresses need to meet flammability standards to prevent fires from spreading, so most companies use flame retardants. However, public health advocates and even some &lt;a href="https://earthjustice.org/feature/firefighters-turn-up-the-heat-on-flame-retardants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;firefighting organizations&lt;/a&gt; say flame retardants are largely ineffective and do more harm than good because of their toxicity both to people exposed to them in products, and firefighters who encounter them in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No federal limits for flame retardant levels in mattresses exist in the US or Canada, but several types of flame retardants that are outright banned in one of the countries, or restricted from use in kids’ products, were found in the mattresses. TCEP, for example, constituted 1% of the weight of one mattress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mattresses made of natural materials such as cotton or latex are less likely to have phthalates, though it’s not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Setting mattresses outside to off-gas after purchase can help get rid of some chemicals, but not all, as phthalates and flame retardants could take years to seep away. Diamond said adding a protective barrier like a terry cloth towel that’s good at absorbing chemicals can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But ultimately, “the onus is on the mattress manufacturers” to stop using toxic chemicals, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The mattress manufacturers need to be more vigilant,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNdExqQnBiVDZjOHl2ZVRZR2poaGVfRlpvX3kxc2ZVVUhibWwtRnhJdUFpc1NXOUEyeV9MdGI3a1lQTWFLeXVMZXo1RS1HNkZXY3NDejR5QUp5UzBLbDdHZGR6dDEwNUQ1bnpQYXY1ZDBfWEtGYmhPMlQ0YjFDMEtjdWZCckw5WlhCeHV2Tkp2bWF0OU0zQTJj</guid></item><item><title>新报告称，癌症死亡率正在下降，但女性的诊断率正在上升- CNN | Cancer death rates declining, new report says, but diagnosis rates are on the rise for women - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE04bE1wWEkzRThOZGg3LTU2R1lpODJaQ2lKYVU5VFd5S0duWFluNFJId2lsNDFqNlBfT2ZyT0FEUWtodlNZSkZ6Z05LU1RabXN4ZmN1SXlOc05ES0x6Q3lGOGxrOHdVZkJoN0ZmN2RGU2ZoNkdjODBodU5BQdIBckFVX3lxTFB4TzEzYVRqMUR2RjRoUFdHSEFuamFrSXRQejF4ZVVzX2pHRUxJbG8yVzg5T0I2STg2dEhoXzJTOVZBMzdsNGNsLVZ3LTJiVjE0WFVSVFItZjJHeVJ4aXhtd3YyRHlBeUtUWTlVTjBFZDNnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A new report on cancer in the US shows a steady decline in overall deaths from 2001 through 2022. The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000053b6o8hgiv9gt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt; shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. After 2020, they returned to expected levels. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000063b6odgesjxa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published Monday in the journal Cancer. It’s based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute, and it’s released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000073b6obw3h0sn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment,” the researchers write. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000083b6ot7p6r2i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. And these sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000093b6oo38zdqrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000a3b6o20gmhhgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/health/young-women-cancer-incidence-report-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previously published research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000b3b6ot870r1pw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. The largest observed increase among women was for stomach cancer, which the researchers say may be largely due to a change in the classification of tumors by the World Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000c3b6out0bzsq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000d3b6oze18y7n2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data continues to show large racial disparities. For example, Black women have a 40% higher rate of death from breast cancer than White women, and their rate of death from uterine cancer is double that of White women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000e3b6o14ohnxve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/health/fdas-formaldehyde-hair-products-trump-administration/index.html"&gt;hair relaxers&lt;/a&gt;, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r48mzm00003b6onmxinsy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Screening&lt;/a&gt; can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread. Screenings are available and recommended for certain people for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most of us have experienced a ringing in our ears – perhaps after a concert or a loud party. Usually, it’s temporary. But imagine living with that same noise constantly. That’s the reality for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/19/the-foods-that-can-ease-tinnitus/"&gt;people with tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. The effects can significantly impact mental health – especially for the 2 per cent who suffer from “tinnitus distress” – a condition that can lead to severe anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed my own symptoms in March 2020. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/tinnitus-dominate-every-hour-how-to-manage/"&gt;constant high-pitched buzzing in both ears&lt;/a&gt; felt as if a tiny insect had penetrated my inner eardrums and become trapped. I’d feel an overwhelming urge to claw at my head – so agitated by this sound, imperceptible to others – that simply refused to stop. I knew exactly what it was. After all, as an NHS-trained audiologist with a clinical doctorate in audiology, I’d been treating patients with similar symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is tinnitus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is described as the perception of a sound in the ear (usually both “bilateral” but sometimes just one, “unilateral tinnitus”) that isn’t presented by an external source, so it can feel uniquely isolating for the sufferer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medically-speaking, when the brain loses access to specific sound inputs, it compensates by increasing neural activity, which is believed to cause the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of sound when none exists. This hyperactivity can also interfere with the brain’s natural filtering mechanisms. What’s more, the limbic (emotional) and autonomic (stress) systems come into play, potentially increasing our awareness and perception of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only five per cent of sufferers have “objective” tinnitus – meaning a doctor can hear the sound with a stethoscope. The majority have “subjective” tinnitus, and there is no test to confirm the disorder – we can only diagnose it based on the symptoms reported. Ten per cent of people – myself included – have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-laugh-selective-deafness-is-a-serious-matter/"&gt;normal hearing according to hearing tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who is most at risk?/What causes it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my patients are aged between 20 and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-ignore-hearing-loss-in-your-50s-how-to-fix-it/"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; – though it can affect anyone, regardless of gender or ethnic background. As tinnitus is commonly linked to hearing loss, there can be a genetic element, and it often increases with age. Exposure to loud noise is a common risk – I’ve treated many musicians and construction workers – but head injuries and certain medications can also trigger symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m now in my thirties and have lived with the condition for five years. Mine began when I was &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/signs-of-stress-eye-twitch-ulcer/"&gt;incredibly stressed at work&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d just had Covid – studies have shown that the virus can cause hearing loss and tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no medical or drug treatments for tinnitus, and sadly, there’s a lot of “snake oil” out there. But these are the strategies I’ve found so effective that the condition now barely affects my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Don’t ignore your tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people with tinnitus are advised to “just ignore it”. But that’s not helpful. If I say, “don’t think of a pink elephant,” the first thing you do is think of a pink elephant! If you’re constantly trying to avoid thoughts of tinnitus, your brain thinks it’s a threat and pays it more attention. Instead it’s better to lean into it when it’s flaring up - use it as a gauge of your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m certain stress plays a role for me, when I’m more stressed my perception of the sound intensifies. This has now become a signal for me to know I’m pushing myself too hard and to take a break. I go into the garden and play with my dog and try to tune into the sounds outside instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;It’s more about your brain than your ears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed there are certain personality types who seem more prone to tinnitus. Those of us who are “type A” who are very highly driven, ambitious and like to be in control can struggle the hardest. Because when we get a medical condition we want to get on top of it as quickly as possible, thinking the harder we work the sooner it will get better. With tinnitus, however, that’s not usually the case. Accepting it’s out of our control can actually help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is brain related, not a physical affliction - it’s not the ears so much as the signal in the brain that’s being generated and triggering negative feelings. Pushing myself harder wasn’t working, realising I needed to change my outlook and spend an evening watching Netflix (instead of chastising myself for being “lazy”) was more what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because no one else can experience the sound you’re hearing there’s a tendency to feel a fraud. I certainly found myself seeking validation from my husband and embarrassed that as an audiologist I couldn’t make my problem go away. Know that tinnitus is uniquely isolating and it’s common for sufferers to avoid socialising, but this can further impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Listen to ‘pink’ noise – not ‘white’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might imagine that listening to “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-white-noise-machine/"&gt;white noise&lt;/a&gt;” can mask tinnitus. But I don’t agree. White noise, for example the sound of an electric fan, is more “broadband” – it’s continuous and harsh. Pink noise is a little bit softer, with different frequencies, so it might be the sound of the ocean or running water with modulations which is more relaxing to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Practice good sleep hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading before bed engages your prefrontal cortex, so as well as being a distraction (especially if you read something escapist, as I tend to) it calms your nervous system. But don’t read in bed, keep bed just for sleeping. Poor sleep can worsen tinnitus, so make sure the room is dark, a comfortable temperature and that your neck is supported (as muscular tension exacerbates tinnitus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Try this easy mindfulness technique&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing mental overwhelm is key with tinnitus, so don’t dismiss mindfulness as too “woo woo,” I promise you it helps. One technique I use to ground me is the “54321”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look for five things that I can see, four things I can hear, three things that I can feel or touch around me, two things that I can smell and one thing that I can taste, like my coffee. This distraction technique forces you into the present moment, telling me that I’m not just hearing my tinnitus, but I’m actively looking for other sounds and sensations to be in the present moment and stop your mind racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises also work well, and there’s an app, Oto, specifically designed for tinnitus which is worth trying. Or simply use one finger to trace the fingers up and down following their shape across your palm, breathing in as you follow them up and out as you follow them down. Even sitting with your feet rooted firmly into the ground is a self soothing device which anchors you, reminding you you’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good technique for calming and distracting is to imagine the same vivid scene time and again. I’m in a cafe with a cup of cappuccino. There’s two ladies sitting on the left of me, having a chat, and they’re laughing. I admire the pink jumper one is wearing. It’s a cosy, happy picture I return to as I feel stress rising. When, in my head, I walk out of the cafe I picture myself walking away from the stress and noise and leaving it behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBT has been found to be one the most effective treatments for tinnitus. This psychological therapy challenges negative thoughts, helps reduce stress and crucially reduces the fear around tinnitus. When I first noticed my own symptoms I often felt so scared I didn’t like to go to bed if my husband wasn’t there. I notice that “fear” is one of the biggest hurdles for my patients too, so CBT teaches us that tinnitus doesn’t mean there is something wrong or that we are unwell. That’s very important in easing agitation. You may not be able to get rid of tinnitus, but CBT can change your relationship with it so much that it no longer dominates your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Susanna Galton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'They just kind of forget to eat,' DeLauer reveals - seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One common habit? Skipping breakfast - unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These accidental fasts could lead to lower insulin levels and a boost in glucagon, a hormone that may&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622837/Daily-pill-replace-weight-loss-injections-like-Ozempic-patients-lose-stone-matter-months-trial-data-shows.html"&gt; help burn fat more &lt;/a&gt;efficiently, DeLauer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says another big thing he noticed with people who are slim is that they tend to prefer operating on an empty stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says these people report preferring to train on an empty stomach and they say they can 'think clearer' when they are not full from a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, lunch is their biggest meal of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Celebrity fitness and nutrition expert Thomas DeLauer has shared some of his surprising insights around how people with little body fat keep in shape (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer talks about his observations in a video as part of his hugely popular YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tells viewers: 'I've spent literally years just asking people what they do to stay in shape or what they do to just naturally be thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people say "I've just always been this way" but when you start actually looking at their habits... you start finding there's these common denominators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One observation that has shocked DeLauer is how many slender people love chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chocolate is often associated with weight gain due to its high calorie and fat content, the fitness aficionado says in small quantities, it could help stave of cravings. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'I have noticed that 60 to 70 percent of people that I know that are thin, they consume a fair bit of chocolate, [mainly] dark chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me, I love dark chocolate and it kills my appetite and it also gives me an energy boost, that I feel really good with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer believes that by having small pieces of chocolate occasionally, slim people 'don't feel like they have to indulge in other places' and it satisfies their sweet cravings without going overboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that dark chocolate has a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe a chemical called theobromine, found in cocoa beans and abundant in milk and dark chocolate, is an underappreciated natural elixir with anti-inflammatory properties that could be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been found to contribute to weight management by enhancing the body's ability to break down fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says that most slim people tend to gravitate towards dark chocolate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While you might think it's down to rigorous dieting and hours in the gym, DeLauer says after observing more than 200 subjects over the years, their fat-busting tactics are much less taxing than that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of their meal choices, DeLauer says slimmer people prefer less fatty foods, and will opt for salads over burgers and leaner cuts of meat such as skinless chicken over a juicy steak.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says in a YouTube video: 'The reality is most [slender] people that I talk to, they don't opt for the fattier cuts, they don't opt for oil.... they tend to just eat that way a little more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Generally speaking, they are the kinds of people that might do two eggs and some egg whites and they might have it cooked dry instead of in oil.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strict portion control is another habit people with little body fat follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a smaller dinner and larger lunch could be the key to shifting weight, and DeLauer says from his observations, many slim people follow this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on meals and portion control, the content creator says: '[For slim people], lunch seems to be the big meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a light breakfast or even skip breakfast, [then a] big lunch and then moving on to dinner, it is just something light and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'How often have you heard that from your thin friends 'it's okay I had a big lunch'... they're aware of that they don't just feel like three square meals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that 'there's a huge metabolic benefit to having a big lunch' and 'a lot of the Mediterranean regions do that'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another of DeLauer's observations around slim people, is that they do the reverse of comfort eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He muses: 'By and large I've noticed that people that are thin, tend to be the people that starve their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meaning when they get stressed or anxious or mad, they tend to not eat compared to people that maybe emotionally or stress eat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that it doesn't mean that slim people never comfort eat when they are stressed but 'these are just common denominators based on about a decade worth of surveying people'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the drinks side of things, DeLauer reveals he has noticed many people with less body fat order water with lemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says whether this is a 'habit or just for flavor' lemon has a multitude of benefits when it comes to keeping weight off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DeLauer says something that has shocked him, is how many slim people are big fans of chocolate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One2021 study out of Germany found that a soluble pectin fiber contained in lemons expands in your stomach, which could help you to feel full for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shakes are another beverage DeLauer says people with less body fat enjoy, along with an array of supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says they often have shakes for breakfast and these people are more aware of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to exercise, DeLauer says many&lt;span&gt; fit people he meets tend to be physically active without trying to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He reveals one consistent character trait is that they are constantly restless, fidgety and highly strung. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'They tend to be the fidgety people, the people that move a lot... sometimes a little edgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just kind of what I've noticed with them... they're always up around the house, always busy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, DeLauer says slim people will tend to be more outdoorsy than the average person, and they enjoy spending more time outside keeping active or they will ditch driving to walk to a location instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are naturally more active, DeLauer claims this population of slim people actually spend less time in the gym as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On this final point he says: 'Finally, I notice a lot of slim people are actually the ones that don't spend a ton of time in the gym.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They do quick workouts... they're usually in and out in less than half an hour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:31:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQUUZGZjdlREo2bDF5VXRZWmlHd2tKRG9JeW95d05sUFJ6RzRhNkttaG1XYktDdm5ObVdLVU42MnNjVWVXd2hoVGNGX1QwcXM3My1kZElSTGI4bFpscDc5bmIzbHpIem1iWjB3cGF2WmRVUG04b1JoQmt3RHZKRG1pR3J4ZzRPTzBuYXRVX3JQa0k2NGdIX3BabFEyZmPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT244MXI2U0RJSTF6VE15SlNCUE1hSXZtTmRDRURCVTR5a2RfWWlXdGpLVDVXQzZrY2RfOUFwdmgzNnFiWF9GMzRRRGt1ZEZaQ202b3ZQbjdKV0RrOHlkUjFsd2JaN0g4QWRHY0xtWEdNV1lMMTNFSzBhQlM3ekE4bFVWZ2FkYlhrZkZ5VHZrbW9ROWw5bDdfTzNFNHFHeDdkSUZR</guid></item><item><title>在美国梅毒病例急剧上升的情况下，特朗普政府牵制了关键的性传播感染实验室--《卫报》 | Trump administration axes key STI lab amid dramatic rise in US syphilis cases - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPODl4VHZHZWJ6VDl1Qm5PU05MTUVlVWN4eTRUQUFMR3ZRdzVmdk8yeUdCQmRTV2lWOVdlNUZVd1BjT2tTMF9wekVLUHhsVlBCM2NnNDJmd1NYVTc0QXFFcmVia05mSVUwVVB0UEptOVZaYlotMXN1M1hRWWlZT1hySzln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;’s cuts to a sexually transmitted infection lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) comes as some states, such as Wisconsin, announce enormous increases in syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Syphilis mitigation is just the latest example of work in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that will be affected by the lab’s closure, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;

The trend mirrors a nationwide increase that officials at the CDC described only two years ago as a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/epidemic-congenital-syphilis-std-cdc" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“heartbreaking”&lt;/a&gt; epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Congenital syphilis is also on the rise. The secondary infection occurs when a fetus is infected with syphilis in the womb. The condition is both highly preventable and devastating. Experts consider even one case a sign of failing health infrastructure, because it is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/17/congenital-syphilis-crisis-us-biden-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;easily treated&lt;/a&gt; with a single-dose antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a raging congenital syphilis epidemic in this country,” said David C Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “CDC’s STI lab provides an important backup to confirm results and to tackle difficult diagnosis. We know this is going to negatively impact on our ability to prevent babies being born with syphilis and to prevent stillborns from syphilis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common diseases in the world – and the most marginalized. Years of flagging public health funding already meant that the US had some of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573159/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;highest STI rates&lt;/a&gt; in the developed world in four diseases tracked by public health authorities: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most recent data shows gonorrhea slightly decreased and chlamydia remained stable, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC from 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New HIV infections&lt;/a&gt; decreased 12% between 2018 and 2022, because of new government supports, some put into place during Trump’s first term. Trump pledged to eliminate HIV in the US in his &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/03/trumps-state-of-the-union-2019-hiv-1140379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; State of the Union address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the short term, we’re going to see a rebound in a lot of this because public health departments are already suffering under the clawback, and people are having to let go of staff and programs that support [pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV],” said Gonsalves. “All this other stuff is collapsing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts have pointed specifically to the highly specialized lab at the CDC, formally called the STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch, as one of the most shocking cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The lab worked on syphilis and multidrug-resistant gonorrhea, sometimes called “super gonorrhea”. It had the “highest degree of viral hepatitis expertise of any public health laboratory in the world”, according to a letter from the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the nation’s only capacity to use a PCR test for syphilis, which primarily still relies on mid-20th-century serology testing. The work was not replicated anywhere else in federal or state government, or in private universities or labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All 28 employees were laid off by the Trump administration on 1 April, alongside a total of roughly 10,000 colleagues in cuts imposed by the health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Together with cuts by the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has lost nearly a quarter of its 82,000-person workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is very concerning to our ability to maintain a functioning public health system and a world-class system that protects the American people,” said Harvey. “We don’t know what’s going to happen, and we’re very worried about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Updating syphilis testing was an especially important project for the lab. Although syphilis is easy to treat, it can be difficult to diagnose, even spawning its own medical aphorism: “He who knows syphilis knows medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Symptoms of the highly invasive bacterium can be mild or go unnoticed for years, causing feared outcomes such as dementia-like symptoms or blindness. Congenital syphilis is a special horror: up to 40% of infants who contract the disease in utero will be stillborn or die. Those that survive can suffer lifelong disabilities including seizures, cataracts and deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In comments made to the Guardian just before Trump was elected, Dr Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she was looking forward to developing new diagnostics for syphilis and researching vaccines for gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’ve made commitments to things we can’t back down on – and STIs are a great example,” Marrazzo said. “One of the most frustrating aspects of syphilis in the field is making a diagnosis of active syphilis and then monitoring the response to therapy … So we desperately need new diagnostics.” As part of Kennedy’s cuts, Marrazzo was placed on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/fauci-s-successor-put-on-leave-as-rfk-jr-reshapes-agencies?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administrative leave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly placed on leave was Jonathan Mermin, former director of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP). In 2023, Mermin described congenital syphilis as “an unacceptable American crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to work on syphilis tests, the CDC lab was charged with investigating cases of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea. Gonorrhea can only be reliably treated with one antibiotic: ceftriaxone. While resistant strains of the infection are rare, they are rising globally – a fact that is only known because the CDC lab was one of three globally that worked alongside the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the disease. Trump pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/world-health-organization-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdraw from the WHO&lt;/a&gt; as one of his first acts as president. It is not clear what will happen to the 50,000 samples of gonorrhea isolates the lab held in freezers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re irreplaceable,” a former CDC employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/05/cdc-sexually-transmitted-diseases-laboratory-closed-by-trump-administration/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;. “Are they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cuts imposed by Doge and Kennedy have also eviscerated expertise and funding for STI research and testing beyond the CDC. The administration’s clawback of more than $11bn ended grants to study STI testing and prevention among trans women in Florida; efforts to improve the health of mothers and babies in the Mississippi Delta region (an area especially hard-hit by congenital syphilis); and a grant to study the best way to tackle the HIV-syphilis “syndemic” in Chicago. HIV awareness campaigns and studies into prophylactic treatment for chlamydia – among many other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The biggest concern about containing syphilis is the erosion of our ability to ensure people who have the disease or who have come into contact with the disease are taken care of medically,” said Brandon Kufalk, supervisor of the STI unit at the Wisconsin department of health services, about cuts to health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We want to maintain our capacity to ensure proper medical care is given, that the correct medications are available to medical facilities, to perform contact tracing on individuals, and communicate what is happening with syphilis in our state effectively,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPODl4VHZHZWJ6VDl1Qm5PU05MTUVlVWN4eTRUQUFMR3ZRdzVmdk8yeUdCQmRTV2lWOVdlNUZVd1BjT2tTMF9wekVLUHhsVlBCM2NnNDJmd1NYVTc0QXFFcmVia05mSVUwVVB0UEptOVZaYlotMXN1M1hRWWlZT1hySzln</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心咨询小组考虑缩小新冠疫苗建议的范围-水星新闻 | CDC advisory group considers narrowing COVID vaccine recommendations - The Mercury News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOaGhUTWhhbnQ4M0t5RkNLS3JGNGdmVlRJRnJwb2lrVDM0V0c4UWJxMFRLWXZRNFVldzN0RHIxT2E3NFZVbEFBcmZmelY1MGVRM3I5Mjl3NzZjM3g5UVlsWFhDelVnZU9nVVY5d01oVGE5ZmZXdG5qeVNLVzRhR05WMW5oQmptNlVTeGZzelFLZEdTUXNuNXE4aG1fRktSU3Y5Y3htNF9XZUZSQnBa0gGyAUFVX3lxTE9GMVFFYlJDU3FqOHZwMWpQbFpuZXAyazl0WjZEdDNFekQzaUxPX3lQZDJMYmVvdDU0a3RsaGJVZmE4SE9ka0VVZVQtTHRBWktsNGQ1SmFvbGVEWGtSLWdsTXVrWVdVSHRnV1FzdkZwWGt0dWpmT056cm11RWV2NnNXbHN5SHFFMDBaN0xuTW5qT3RNbEw1d2pYWXdJYnFMREh5c0JRLU4yQzBsa1NzQWtTREE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If finalized in June, the change could put the U.S. more in line with other countries' recommendations.            &lt;/p&gt;

Dr Chris van Tulleken, known for his &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/bbc" data-link-tracking="InArticle|AutoLink"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; science programmes and expertise in infectious diseases, alongside his medical twin brother Dr Xand, a regular on &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/bbc" data-link-tracking="InArticle|AutoLink"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Morning Live, left listeners including host Steven Bartlett astounded with his claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his recent work titled "Ultra-Processed People," Dr Chris addresses the persistent confusion about what constitutes a healthy diet: "For a very long time, we have been incredibly confused about what to eat." He points out the common misunderstanding regarding unhealthy foods: "We've called the foods that harm us junk food and processed food - high fat, salt and sugar food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-top-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've not had a way of labeling food even as a pandemic of disease taken over the world," reports Birmingham Live. Dr Chris also draws attention to the global reach of this problem, affecting impoverished nations and disadvantaged communities within the UK alike: "This is particularly true in low income countries and particularly true with low income people living in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautions about the dire impact of diets laden with ultra-processed foods (UPF): "So poor diet, which means a diet high and ultra processed foods (UPF), has overtaken tobacco as a leading cause of early death on planet Earth for humans, for the animals we farm and for wild animals.", as reported by the Mirror. He delves into the detrimental effects of such foods on our planet: "This is because ultra-processed food is produced by food system that is the leading cause of loss of biodiversity and the second-leading cause of carbon emissions and the leading cause of plastic pollution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis" class="ovp-primis-h251"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shed light on the origins of the term 'ultra-processed food': "So about 12 years ago, the definition was developed to describe a western industrial American diet. And it was done by a team in Brazil, and much of the best work on this stuff has been done by teams in Central and South America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His observations reveal a dramatic shift in health trends within certain nations: "In places like Mexico, Columbia and Brazil, obesity was essentially unheard of and within a decade, it went to being the dominant public health problem. Where once obesity was a rarity, in a span of 10 years "everyone would know someone who had an amputation for type two diabetes." The question arises as to what influenced this rapid escalation: The expert continued: "The only thing that has changed was the influx of, broadly an American diet of industrial processed foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the evolution of the concept, he noted: "The definition was invented in 2009/2010 and we've had a decade evidence now that is very clear that it is ultra processed food that is responsible, not just for pandemic weight gain and obesity, but also for a long list of other health problems, including early death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlights the dangerously addictive nature of UPFs, likening them to tobacco, alcohol, gambling and drugs, stressing that this assertion is backed by solid research. He also warned that "nagging" someone to give up junk food for the sake of health and weight loss is counterproductive, often leading to the opposite effect and "pushes people towards doing things that are harmful and generally makes them more likely to do the thing you're nagging them about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further noted: "High UPF consumption is associated with an increased risk of a variety of chronic diseases and mental health disorders. At present, not a single study reported an association between UPF intake and a beneficial health outcome. These findings suggest that dietary patterns with low consumption of UPFs may render broad public health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A viewer responded to the video on YouTube, saying: "I cannot overstate how much Chris has changed my life in the space of just 5 months. In early June I watched a podcast in which he was a guest and he spoke about the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the 6th June 2023, I've cut out ultra-processed food almost entirely from my diet. Initially I thought it'd be impossible to find foods without crap in it but it's actually been really easy. When I fancy a snack I have an apple or a few grapes, or some nuts. I have a variety of home cooked meals every night. For breakfast I have a 'full fat' natural yoghurt (containing just milk) and occasionally I'll have toast with organic jam or scrambled eggs on the weekend (bread sourced from a bakery).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The home cooked meals aren't what people would consider particularly healthy (plenty of meat, cheese, starchy foods) and I've not cut down on portion sizes. In the last five months I've gone from 112KG to 99.9 KG (as of yesterday). The only other lifestyle change I've made is to take a one-hour walk every week day. Other than this, I've done no other exercise in the last 5 months whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 12:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNSnJENWNOTzlOeVRoN3RYYUZsMHpyeUdMai13RFR0MnVyenhndmd4Qkt2amoxV0VzbE1uWFFEYWE1ZVc0UVRUQUMwWFVnbEtqSHU2VE1lLTJUY0Y3aWdHcDFkRnRSdmhYa3luT09GRFhuVUYtUUc5dXVRMjluZGhFQlJheThJSEp30gGOAUFVX3lxTFBMbmRkVGZjVFl2UUd1TzVJanFmZjF0X2xBcHB1X2lxbzFGclMySFU5Uk1DVGhLaW5UMUdKMDJtcjJYQjA0U29ucWFNMTBuRGRteWVKWm9ISU1ET1ZITFVITF9YMUpTN0ZiQ1ZuWENLbUU1QlpxN1VGZTVxWDBEYW1yYkF3RlIxX0VQTGZTR0E</guid></item><item><title>这种维生素含量低的饮食可能会影响您的记忆力-印度时报 | A diet low in THIS vitamin may affect your memory - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxOdUtzV0NfNkI1SjNnb3o3bjZ6b2pFcjREenRpcVlnUW91Q1VkM2dfb3VxcVFBUHh3ZjJ4djVuVUhiVnBMdWptWHVkaDRLYVU4Z3FjVFBzXzA3eFQ1RDY5NkE1ZjFwZ0hvM25UYmFBUi1qRlpLQjUtd2FLcFpXRnhpZnlRZGRneTlsY2YyODVGdUthNkZhRW9uZXdPYTNnRTRwQTNHdGxhTzVSSU1XdmJDaUhySFotMjFwMElFN001Wm13ckljN2FhamVQQmgzUGxNMzBpYjVVak5SVmRBLWE2b3p2NA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have trouble walking down memory lane? Are you missing some of the chores on your to-do list? Well, it's time to look at your plate. Yes, that’s right. Your diet has a lot to do with cognition. A new study has found that the absence or decrease of certain vitamins in your diet may impair memory and accelerate cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022316625000306?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that low vitamin K intake impairs cognition, neurogenesis, and elevates neuroinflammation in mice. The study highlights the importance of vitamin K for better brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the link between vitamin K and cognitive function, the researchers examined middle-aged male and female mice fed a low vitamin K diet or another group with a regular diet for six months. The results were surprising. They found that the mice on the low vitamin K diet exhibited poorer cognitive performance and reduced vitamin K levels in their brains compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also research that indicates vitamin K contributes to brain function and that brain function declines during the aging process,” Tong Zheng, lead author of the study and a research scientist at the HNRCA, said in a news release. “Vitamin K seems to have a protective effect. Our research is trying to understand the underlying mechanism for that effect so that we might one day be able to target those mechanisms specifically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that the mice on the low vitamin K diet had less interest in exploring novel objects, a hint of impaired recognition memory. The researchers also looked at the physiological differences. Mice on the low vitamin K diet had lower levels of Menaquinone-4 (MK4), which is the primary form of vitamin K in the brain. They also had a lower amount of vitamin K in their livers and kidneys. Male mice on the low vitamin K diet had a decreased survival rate and lower weight gain compared to female mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found changes in the hippocampus of vitamin K-deficient mice, which pointed to cognitive decline. “We found a higher number of activated microglia, which are the major immune cells in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/work/trick-your-brain-to-become-successful-with-these-7-simple-psychological-laws/articleshow/120430237.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. While microglia play a vital role in maintaining brain health, their overactivation can lead to chronic inflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases,” Zheng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution that the study does not mean people should go after vitamin K supplements; instead, try adding vegetables to their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This included not only doctors and nurses but also blood bank runners, lab runners and many others who were ready for the child to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Trauma care takes a village,” said Dr. Katherine Hoops, who leads the Clinical Programs and Practice Team at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions. Mental health professionals and social workers are also critical to have on staff for these responses, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Firearm injuries are the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leading cause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death among children and teens in the US.

Data from 2018 through 2023 in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and DC was included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The analysis specifically showed that most of the patients with gunshot wounds arrived at the emergency department between 2:30 and 3 a.m., and the slowest times were between 10 and 10:30 a.m. The peaks were highest overnights from Friday into Saturday and Saturday into Sunday. The case rates were highest in July and lowest in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although emergency departments might have adequate staff at off times, other hospital resources might be limited at night and on weekends, which could be a problem in these emergencies, Johns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say there can still be deviations from these patterns, underscoring the importance of continued emergency room staffing. The peaks can also differ for firearm injuries in pediatric patients, Johns explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US. - Sarah L.

Kennedy Jr. to reinstate the center, which lost more than 200 employees, according to Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, which is leading the newly formed coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67d60b72baca3a655c137808/t/67f99eefce19ad5f787f58f6/1744412399452/Letter+to+Sec+Kennedy+from+Safe+States+Alliance+041125.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational.

            The recent study, which was published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the firearm injury visits are not evenly distributed.

            Experts say the results are not surprising but that the findings from this analysis — which the authors say is the largest of its kind to use timely data in urban and rural areas — can inform staffing to provide better care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Knowing when firearm injury emergency department visits are higher can help inform decisions about physician staffing, resource allocation, and trauma preparedness to reduce delays in care and use resources most effectively,” the CDC said in an email to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Johns says the young child she treated survived because there was well-prepared staff at the hospital’s &lt;a href="https://www.amtrauma.org/page/traumalevels" target="_blank"&gt;Level 1 trauma center&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Just the sheer number of staff – there must have been 15 people, with the appropriate team inside the room and at the bedside,” Johns said. This included not only doctors and nurses but also blood bank runners, lab runners and many others who were ready for the child to arrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000b3b5vp5x0u6yx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Trauma care takes a village,” said Dr. Katherine Hoops, who leads the Clinical Programs and Practice Team at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions. Mental health professionals and social workers are also critical to have on staff for these responses, she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Firearm injuries are the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death among children and teens in the US. Emergency medical service encounters for firearm injury spiked in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/firearm-injuries-cdc/index.html"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; and remain higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Firearm suicides have continued to rise and are now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than at any other point in the past 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000d3b5vf5k7nivi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study analyzed over 93,000 emergency department visits for firearm injury through data from the CDC’s Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms, or FASTER, which collects real time data from select jurisdictions. Data from 2018 through 2023 in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and DC was included.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000h3b5v93czv0ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis specifically showed that most of the patients with gunshot wounds arrived at the emergency department between 2:30 and 3 a.m., and the slowest times were between 10 and 10:30 a.m. The peaks were highest overnights from Friday into Saturday and Saturday into Sunday. The case rates were highest in July and lowest in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000i3b5vt0ww0shf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although emergency departments might have adequate staff at off times, other hospital resources might be limited at night and on weekends, which could be a problem in these emergencies, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000j3b5vh8aqo1c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say there can still be deviations from these patterns, underscoring the importance of continued emergency room staffing. The peaks can also differ for firearm injuries in pediatric patients, Johns explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000k3b5vgurqy7gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FASTER program is run through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, a division of the CDC that was heavily targeted during federal job cuts this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000l3b5vi5bn02nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 40 health organizations have urged US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate the center, which lost more than 200 employees, according to Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, which is leading the newly formed coalition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000m3b5vjxnzhsq1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67d60b72baca3a655c137808/t/67f99eefce19ad5f787f58f6/1744412399452/Letter+to+Sec+Kennedy+from+Safe+States+Alliance+041125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls36qn00003b5vjb5hx0nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational. The database initiative was funded in 2023 through August 2028, according to the agency, but continuation of this work is contingent on future appropriations from Congress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu00093b5vek8obfb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the surveillance branch has remained intact, other research and programming staff from the center has largely been let go, according to a former employee of the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000a3b5vkpe7rzm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if the data sets remain, they will be rendered useless because they have nobody to clean the data, analyze the data and tell you what it means,” Gilmartin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000b3b5vq0edi89i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Firearm research has been stunted for years because of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993413/#:~:text=For%20more%20than%2020%20years,be%20devoted%20to%20such%20research." target="_blank"&gt;Dickey Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced in 1996 and prohibited the use of federal dollars on research that may promote gun control, according to the former National Center for Injury Prevention and Control employee. The budget for fiscal year &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/lifting-of-federal-funding-ban-tied-to-increase-in-gun-violence-research/#" target="_blank"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; reintroduced funding for gun violence research for the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000c3b5vehsj70c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a result of banning us from doing that work, the field of firearm violence is pretty far behind,” the former employee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000d3b5vaebf0vxx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, experts are worried that this work could fall even further amid possible cuts laid out in an&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/politics/trump-rfk-jr-budget-cut-health/index.html"&gt; internal document&lt;/a&gt; reviewed by CNN last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9qzw9er00023b6o0mca6k07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The document showed that the Trump administration is formulating plans to slash federal health spending and consolidate dozens of health programs into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that Kennedy announced during the layoffs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000e3b5vn4qlz72y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plan could still change, but the document currently indicates that while some National Center for Injury Prevention and Control programs will become part of AHA’s primary care programs, others will be completely eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9qzwuoi00043b6o16h50mgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The center’s Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research is among those with a zeroed-out budget in the proposal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            When Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, thinks about her time working at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, one case always comes rushing back:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lt2q6000003b6oqeusk9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two-year-old. Gunshot wound. Chest. ETA five minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00033b5v8yw15j3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was rushed to the emergency department after being accidentally shot by an older sibling who was playing with a gun that was left unlocked in the house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00043b5vs3hsmskl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ll never forget the … child on the stretcher and the blood-curdling screams of the parent outside the room, lying on the floor, distraught,” Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00053b5v6bk6xw1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every 30 minutes, an emergency department treats another firearm injury, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02874" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at 10 jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9m1rr5700013b6ow14je84m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But cuts from the US Department of Health and Human Services and proposed changes to the federal budget could threaten research that reveals these kinds of firearm injury patterns. Experts say it would be nearly impossible to replicate the scale and scope of the timely firearm research the federal government is able to conduct.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00063b5vzcb37c32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The recent study, which was published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the firearm injury visits are not evenly distributed. There were more firearm injury presentations at night, on the weekends and on some holidays, like Independence Day and New Year’s Eve.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00073b5vlvmhd9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            “No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67d60b72baca3a655c137808/t/67f99eefce19ad5f787f58f6/1744412399452/Letter+to+Sec+Kennedy+from+Safe+States+Alliance+041125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.”

            The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational. The database initiative was funded in 2023 through August 2028, according to the agency, but continuation of this work is contingent on future appropriations from Congress.

            Although the surveillance branch has remained intact, other research and programming staff from the center has largely been let go, according to a former employee of the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

            Firearm research has been stunted for years because of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993413/#:~:text=For%20more%20than%2020%20years,be%20devoted%20to%20such%20research." target="_blank"&gt;Dickey Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced in 1996 and prohibited the use of federal dollars on research that may promote gun control, according to the former National Center for Injury Prevention and Control employee. The budget for fiscal year &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/lifting-of-federal-funding-ban-tied-to-increase-in-gun-violence-research/#" target="_blank"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; reintroduced funding for gun violence research for the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health.

            “As a result of banning us from doing that work, the field of firearm violence is pretty far behind,” the former employee said.

            Now, experts are worried that this work could fall even further amid possible cuts laid out in an&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/politics/trump-rfk-jr-budget-cut-health/index.html"&gt; internal document&lt;/a&gt; reviewed by CNN last week.

            The document showed that the Trump administration is formulating plans to slash federal health spending and consolidate dozens of health programs into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that Kennedy announced during the layoffs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000e3b5vn4qlz72y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plan could still change, but the document currently indicates that while some National Center for Injury Prevention and Control programs will become part of AHA’s primary care programs, others will be completely eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The center’s Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research is among those with a zeroed-out budget in the proposal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affectionate mothering in childhood may have a lasting impact on important personality traits, potentially influencing life outcomes such as educational achievement, economic success, and health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found in the results of a new twin study, the data suggests that positive maternal parenting could foster important traits such as openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Personality traits are strong predictors of important life outcomes, from academic and career success to health and well-being,” said Jasmin Wertz, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that fostering positive parenting environments in early childhood could have a small but significant and lasting impact on the development of these crucial personality traits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study examined changes in the Big Five personality traits, which are viewed by personality psychologists as the five basic dimensions of human personality: extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, or emotional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wertz and her colleagues examined how maternal affection during childhood—specifically between the ages of 5 and 10—predicted the Big Five personality traits at age 18. Their research was published by the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined data from 2,232 British identical twins (51.1% female) who were followed from birth through age 18 as part of the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twins Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying identical twins allows researchers to control for genetic and environmental factors by comparing identical twins who grew up in the same family. During the study, researchers conducted home visits with the twins’ mothers and recorded them talking about each of their children. Trained observers then rated the mothers’ responses for warmth and affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twins whose mothers expressed more warmth toward them in childhood were rated as more open, conscientious and agreeable as young adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results offer evidence that positive, affectionate mothering can affect key personality traits that are linked to success later in life, and these influences could have an impact across generations, said Wertz. The researchers note that even modest changes in personality could lead to significant population-wide benefits over time, particularly in promoting conscientiousness, which is strongly associated with success in education, work, and health, as well as the presence of discipline and orderliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no lasting associations between maternal affection and extraversion or neuroticism. These findings suggest that other environmental or genetic factors—such as peer relationships, life experiences, and perhaps later interventions—may be more influential for these in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2025/04/power-affectionate-mothering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; also underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors when designing programs aimed at promoting positive personality traits, according to Wertz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research provides valuable evidence for the potential of parenting programs to influence critical aspects of personality development,” she said. “However, it also highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of how different factors, including genetics, parenting and life experiences, interact to shape who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wertz believes the research provides important practical considerations for policymakers and practitioners working in education, family welfare and mental health. Given that conscientiousness may predict success in school and the workplace, interventions designed to enhance affectionate parenting could contribute to improving educational outcomes, mental health and social well-being on a broader scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are many proven ways to support parents, such as policies that improve a family’s financial situation; access to treatment for parents who struggle with mental health problems such as depression; and parenting programs that help parents build stronger relationships with their children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also sheds light on the possibility of developing parental training models to address inequalities in personality development. “By targeting parenting practices that promote positive traits in childhood, it may be possible to reduce disparities in life outcomes associated with socioeconomic background, family dynamics and other environmental factors,” Wertz said.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Blood in stool is never normal. You need to get it checked out,' she urged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer can cause blood in the stool when cancerous tumours bleed into the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood can sometimes be seen in the stool as a bright red, dark red or black colour, and can make the stool itself a darker, tarry shade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early stages, it can also be present in such small amounts as to be naked to the human eye and only detectable through stool tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood in stool does not always indicate colon cancer, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other conditions like haemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and anal fissures can also cause the symptom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second symptom of colon cancer in young people is unintentional weight loss, Dr Lamm added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing weight without trying is not normal, and could be a sign of the disease, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unintentional weight loss can indicate a range of different cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be caused when cancer cells and the body's reaction to them alters the metabolism, creating a loss of both fat and muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancerous growths release what's known as cytokines - chemicals that increase inflammation, leading to a faster metabolism and calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells also consume a significant amount of energy, causing the body to burn more calories at rest to support this increased demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the number one sign of colon cancer is persistent abdominal pain, says Dr Lamm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whether it's bloating, getting full fast, or crampy abdominal pain, if it's a new symptom that persists more than four weeks, you want to get it checked out,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pain or cramping in the same place of the abdomen is particularly concerning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pain can be constant, or become more pronounced after eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The advice I have for everyone listening is don't be afraid to talk about your poop, or look at your poop. We all should,' added Dr Lamm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has repeatedly documented the global rise of colon cancer among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps the most recognisable victim of the trend is Deborah James — known as 'bowel babe' — who was diagnosed at just 35 and raised millions for charity in her final days in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;James spoke of her rigorous exercise routine, and being in the best shape of her life when she developed the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zu Rafalat, 38, of Finsbury Park, whose bloating left her looking 'six months pregnant', was horrified to be diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer. She is pictured on holiday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Rafalat, pictured riding a horse before her diagnosis, said: 'I've been fit and healthy for my entire life. I never dreamed I could get bowel cancer at my age'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another example of seemingly fit and health women being hit by the disease was Zu Rafalat, of Finsbury Park, London, who died in 2020 aged 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The super-fit globetrotter initially thought she had caught a stomach bug in Central America where she went on holiday in December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But two weeks later, her stomach had become so swollen she was wearing maternity jeans, and even her GP asked if she was pregnant before prescribing IBS pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After getting the opinion of a second, private doctor, Ms Rafalat was given CT scans which spotted a mass on her right ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It later turned out to be stage four bowel cancer which had spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rafalat, who was managing director of a consultancy agency, said at the time: 'I've been fit and healthy for my entire life. I never dreamed I could get bowel cancer at my age.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics suggest that the size of families in many countries is shrinking and a growing number of parents worldwide either willingly or unwillingly end up only having one child. While many psychology studies have explored the differences between individuals who have siblings and those who don't, the effects of not having any brothers or sisters on people's brains and behavior are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Past research has yielded varying and sometimes contradictory results, which sometimes hinted at negative effects of being an only child and other times highlighted its positive implications. In addition, these negative and positive effects were found to be inconsistent across studies, with some studies suggesting that only children tend to do better at school, are more pro-social and less problematic, while others showed the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and other institutes in China recently carried out a study aimed at better understanding how being an only child affects people's brain and behavior during adulthood. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02142-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, highlight specific patterns in the brain's development and activity, as well as behavioral tendencies, that are commonly observed in adults who grew up without siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the worldwide increase in only-child families, it is crucial to understand the effects of growing up without siblings (GWS) on the adult brain, behavior and the underlying pathways," Jie Tang, Jing Zhang and their colleagues wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using the CHIMGEN cohort, we investigated the associations of GWS with adult brain structure, function, connectivity, cognition, personality and mental health, as well as the pathway from GWS to GWS-related growth environments to brain and to behavior development, in 2,397 pairs of individuals with and without siblings well matched in covariates."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data collected as part of the Chinese Imaging Genetics (CHIMGEN) study, which was carried out at 32 research centers in China. They arranged the participants who met their study's selection criteria into pairs, which contained one only child and one person with siblings who had similar demographics and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the brains and behaviors of these pairs of participants, the researchers were able to attain new insight into how a lack of siblings affects the brain and people's behaviors in adulthood. Interestingly, they uncovered recurring patterns among only children in the integrity of white matter, volume of the brain, neuronal activity, memory and mental health, while also unveiling characteristic behavioral phenotypes (i.e., cognitive, personality-related and behavioral tendencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found associations linking GWS to higher language fiber integrity, lower motor fiber integrity, larger cerebellar volume, smaller cerebral volume and lower frontotemporal spontaneous brain activity," wrote Tang, Zhang and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to the stereotypical impression of associations between GWS and problem behaviors, we found positive correlations of GWS with neurocognition and mental health. Despite direct effects, GWS affects most brain and behavioral outcomes through modifiable environments, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/socioeconomic+status/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/maternal+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;maternal care&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/family+support/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;family support&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting targets for interventions to enhance children's healthy growth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent study suggests that while being an only child can have direct effects on people's brain and behavior, most of its effects are related to the environment in which only children grow up and the stimuli they are or are not exposed to. This suggests that carefully designed interventions aimed at broadening the experiences and opportunities available to only children could help to improve their brain functions, mental health and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/behavior/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

Known for his humility, compassion, and outspoken views on poverty and climate change, Francis left behind a powerful legacy. But behind this news lies a medical condition that not many are familiar with — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bcmj.org/articles/bilateral-pneumonia-lessons-learned-unusual-presentation" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;bilateral pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports confirm that the Pope had long suffered from chronic lung issues and had part of a lung removed in his youth. His health took a turn in February 2025, when he was hospitalised for a respiratory infection that eventually turned into double (bilateral) pneumonia, leading to a 38-day hospital stay: The longest of his papacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here is all we need to know about what this condition is, who it affects the most, and what can be done about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is bilateral pneumonia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilateral pneumonia is also referred to as double pneumonia, is a serious infection that affects both lungs. In this condition, the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in both lungs become inflamed and may fill up with fluid or pus. This makes it difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weakness or fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilateral pneumonia doesn’t always start with dramatic symptoms. It can begin with something as mild as a cough or slight fever. But as the condition spreads through both lungs, symptoms can quickly become more serious. High fever, chills, persistent coughing, shortness of breath even while resting, chest pain, confusion (especially in older adults), and extreme tiredness are some of the signs that signal a need for immediate medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (WHO), pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infection, especially among older adults and children under five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilateral pneumonia can affect anyone, but some groups are more vulnerable:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="h4 strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Older adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People above the age of 65 are at much higher risk. This is because, with age, the immune system becomes weaker, making it harder to fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="h4 strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;People with chronic lung conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who already have breathing issues like chronic bronchitis, asthma, or a history of lung surgery face a greater danger. Pope Francis himself had part of one lung removed, which may have made it difficult for his body to respond to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="h4 strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Infants and young children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, especially those below the age of five, are also highly vulnerable to pneumonia. Their immune systems are not fully developed, which puts them at risk of complications if not treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="h4 strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;People with weakened immune systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes individuals with HIV, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, or anyone on long-term immunosuppressive medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes bilateral pneumonia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why pneumonia can develop, and sometimes it’s hard to tell which one is responsible without lab tests. The most common causes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bacteria – such as Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Viruses – like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fungi – more common in people with weak immunity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, what starts as a simple cold or flu can worsen and lead to pneumonia, especially in vulnerable people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can be done?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection and proper treatment are critical in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;managing pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, especially when it affects both lungs. Here's what the standard treatment approach looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hospitalisation in severe cases, like in the case of Pope Francis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics or antiviral medications, depending on the cause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen therapy if breathing becomes difficult&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluids and rest to help the body recover&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the patient is elderly or already has lung issues, recovery can take longer, and complications may arise. That’s why many doctors recommend flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines, particularly for those over 60 or with chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pope Francis Dies At 88 – Global Catholic World Mourns After Shocking Vatican Announcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxOSlBGekJ3ZF9ZOW1PZFQxQ1lIUE9LS3o1NVhuVzhOa2tIa1RCSEN3Q3pNZ2VZR2t3TVFhVE1DdDg2TnVVYzNiTVBnS2ZWOXBsVDdzUGxaVXQ0bE10cDFZXzJVQ3hnMFhwVzFZS1UwSU93N0tvY24tbEQ2MDFmVnd3TGVMal8ySWs3dzRoeVZkYldRa0R3TVFsY3o1NTNtLTVaekdFeVF5My04VTI0WVRkNVB6QjljOW9DS1NqTnFZVGo0M2VfZjByQzliMFJWd25OVExWdFVRM1h4RnVpLUJWSjhsT09IdTJfXzVQMDVMRGFZOHBLSGRYVUZ5UUY5RnNyc0lWajhTWldaOWxvZDdIYQ</guid></item><item><title>您应该比您想象的更早关注骨骼健康—原因如下- MindBodyGreen | You Should Focus On Bone Health Earlier Than You Might Think — Here's Why - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxObEVMcEVjN2lBc1prN1lRSEpCVHhsZzJwUFNka2d2SEh4WXEtRHFpSHFmdG1zd2twUHNldVFraVVDbVF2S3VCeF9hS0d4aDhpZGY4RE52MXJBVnY1Nm16VkR1bUhsVmxfZ2FHNHlBbm5Va2dXUHpOTS00cVdaV1RrU2JOajk3YU9qNHFIR2ZGcFFWUjAwd2U1enZzSmdFemhC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're seeing an exciting shift in how women approach fitness, health, and aging—with an emphasis on strength and longevity versus being small and thin.

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty bending down and standing up, feeling dizzy when standing up quickly, and swollen legs are also indicators that your heart is not adapting to your positions or is holding spare fluid in the body and needs attention. &lt;span&gt;But research of 2,000 adults found 54 per cent wouldn’t associate most of these symptoms with poor heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And half have suffered at least one of these symptoms before. &lt;span&gt;Dr Ameet Bakhai, who has a special interest in research into how lifestyle factors can impact cardiac health and how we can prevent this, also revealed an adult with a healthy heart should be able to run up two flights of stairs without getting out of breath and squat on a toilet, providing they have no other health conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, a healthy adult should be able to hold their breath comfortably for 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Ameet, who has been advising Healthspan's Love Your Heart supplement range, which commissioned the research, said: “We often ignore our heart health and it’s signals until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There’s no annual MOT to be passed for most of us, so we ignore the small signals that our own engine is not performing ideally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Heart issues can often get progressively worse, until one day you have a more complicated issue - that could have been avoided if you'd heeded the warning signs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Heart issues can be connected to other things - you might consider not being able to run up two flights of stairs more of a lung condition or a lack of fitness or of weight gain, but there is a lot of overlap with coronary artery disease or heart valve problems or irregular heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So, looking after your heart health is essential and should be planned as a new year resolution every year.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The public study also found one in five adults have reported feeling dizzy after standing up too quickly, while 11 per cent have experienced chest tightness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a third think such symptoms could be from a number of different things, while 26 per cent just didn’t see them as ‘serious’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worryingly, 17 per cent didn’t raise these issues with other people because they didn’t want to be seen as melodramatic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And 13 per cent consider themselves simply too young to have heart issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr Bakhai added: “This is sadly a misunderstanding as heart disease can affect people of all ages, particularly in the era of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, as the virus can attack the heart and the heart lining quite commonly as a condition called myopericarditis (inflamed heart and heart covering - the pericardium).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Warning signs like chest tightness, aches in your arms or jaw, dizziness on standing, breathlessness with bending down should act like a wake-up call that your heart is calling out for help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Becoming heart aware is vital and more than half of those in the survey were not aware that if they partner had suffered a cardiac episode in the last five years it was highly likely that their risk factors are also increased due to parallel lifestyles.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rob Hobson, registered and sports nutritionist with Healthspan, said: “These results show a bit of a contradiction between what people do, and what they’re doing for their heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Millions know heart health is vitally important yet ignore warning signs and do heart-unfriendly things like eating junk food, smoking and the survey showed people are trying to make changes but there is a clear lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Simple dietary changes and supporting dietary gaps with heart specific supplements, such as Love Your Heart, can all make a difference over time, and over half of those asked are conscious they need to keep their heart healthy but knew little about what supplements to take to help them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 HEART HEALTH SYMPTOMS BRITS HAVE HAD – AND NOT ALWAYS INVESTIGATED:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Dizziness on standing up quickly&lt;br&gt;2. Shortness of breath&lt;br&gt;3. Difficulty bending down&lt;br&gt;4. Palpitations&lt;br&gt;5. Tightness of the chest&lt;br&gt;6. Arm pain - neck or upper arms often the left&lt;br&gt;7. Difficulty standing up&lt;br&gt;8. Chest discomfort (excluding tightness)&lt;br&gt;9. Swollen legs&lt;br&gt;10. Frequent extra or skipped heartbeats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOUXNrc0czcjFVb0R4VTYydEp0WXFWR3R2dHBTSFUwRTVlRkwyNGE5SzJjRzJkZmlOYndJWE1mQkNyRjNxRHA0X3JHd2RNYnlXeXVuWEV2OHhNNHhXUFZzdnVtaHotMWZYNGxnbzczYzl3RkdxTS14c01nWlZjSjJHVnluQXVyVmlVSVNVbTNB</guid></item><item><title>8个科学支持的戒酒理由-福布斯 | 8 Science-Backed Reasons For Quitting Alcohol - Forbes</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPaHlDYlB4UGZhQmxmZEtsWGtsdjNOZmdQb1BTZ19mQWkxY0xOSmhXZ3E3WXY5UW45clVMSWd1WXB6MV9uelh0d3gyaTV1cTM5UkFiRDZtODFWbWZMRTdKTENoZFpFbUs0N1BPSGlPakZsdGZsZUFRdjNEMVRiaDFTSEFhZG1UMnI3Y1k4UGpLa1pwVHJQdlI0TzI3R0QtTGRKMGtz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-0" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;“No thanks.” Choosing health over habits — because saying no to alcohol is saying yes to better &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; health, improved sleep, clearer thinking, and a longer life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol holds a paradoxical place in modern life — celebrated for its ability to enhance social connection — but also associated with health risks. What is increasingly clear is that for those aiming to optimize their long-term health and reduce alcohol health risks, quitting alcohol completely or cutting back dramatically may be one of the most impactful decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait, isn’t light drinking good for you?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, it’s true that decades of observational studies suggested there might be health benefits from light drinking, in particular from red wine. But what is increasingly clear is that those studies were &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/02/four-reasons-red-wine-is-no-longer-a-health-food/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/02/four-reasons-red-wine-is-no-longer-a-health-food/" target="_self" aria-label="flawed"&gt;flawed&lt;/a&gt; due to what’s called “healthy user bias”. That’s where light drinkers do better because they are wealthier, more socially connected, and more health — not because of the alcohol they’re drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major public health organizations including the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol" aria-label="World Health Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have updated their guidance, now stating that no level of alcohol consumption is truly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are eight science-backed reasons to consider quitting alcohol for good, or at least scaling back drinking considerably to less than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol Increases Cancer Risk — Even at Low Levels, Quitting Alcohol Reduces That Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most consistent findings is the link between alcohol and cancer. Alcohol is classified as a Class 1 carcinogen. This is the same category as tobacco and asbestos. Alcohol use has been definitively linked to at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, liver, esophageal, oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/em&gt; estimated that over 740,000 new cancer cases globally in 2020 (4.1% of cases) were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00279-5/fulltext#:~:text=Globally%2C%20about%20741%20000%2C%20or,and%20breast%20(in%20females)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00279-5/fulltext#:~:text=Globally%2C%20about%20741%20000%2C%20or,and%20breast%20(in%20females)." aria-label="attributable"&gt;attributable&lt;/a&gt; to alcohol consumption. Even low levels of alcohol use contributes to measurable risk. For example, women consuming just one drink of alcohol per day have a 7–10% higher risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Dramatically Improves Sleep Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alcohol may help people fall asleep faster, it disrupts the structure and quality of sleep throughout the night. Alcohol suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, increases wakefulness in the latter half of the night, and impairs the body’s ability to enter restorative deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, the effect is obvious. But for others, the loss of restorative sleep can be more subtle. Ask anyone who wears a sleep tracker about the type of sleep they get after a night of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is that even a single night of drinking can lead to daytime fatigue, poor concentration, and irritability. On the flip side, abstaining from alcohol — even for just two weeks — can improve &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/29/10-drug-free-ways-to-sleep-better-according-to-andrew-huberman/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/29/10-drug-free-ways-to-sleep-better-according-to-andrew-huberman/" target="_self" aria-label="sleep quality"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, reduce nighttime awakenings and enhance next-day energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Is Impaired By Alcohol, Quitting Alcohol Improves It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even light drinking is associated with measurable negative effects on the brain. A 2022 study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from over 36,000 participants found that consuming as little as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5" aria-label="1–2 drinks per day was linked to reduced brain volume"&gt;1–2 drinks per day was linked to reduced brain volume&lt;/a&gt; and white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also interferes with the brain’s neurotransmitter systems — particularly GABA and glutamate — disrupting mood, memory and learning. Over time, alcohol accelerates brain inflammation and aging, increasing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Health Isn’t Improved With Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-held belief that moderate drinking protects the heart has been overturned by more rigorous scientific analyses. Mendelian randomization &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/" aria-label="studies"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, which use genetic proxies to reduce confounding, have found that even light alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology now both emphasize that alcohol should not be promoted for cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Can Reverse Some Liver Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver is one of the organs most affected by alcohol. Regular drinking can cause fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis (e.g. scarring) which can progress to cirrhosis as well as liver cancer. Alcohol has a number of negative health effects on the body including an increase in oxidative stress, an impairment of cellular repair and increased intestinal permeability — commonly referred to as “leaky gut” — which allows harmful endotoxins to reach the liver through the bloodstream, intensifying inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, the liver can begin healing quickly once alcohol intake stops. Early-stage fatty liver disease can reverse within weeks, while longer-term abstinence may even reverse some of the fibrosis. While cirrhosis is not fully reversible, abstaining from alcohol can stop its progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Health Can Be Improved By Quitting Alcohol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol affects hormonal balance in both men and women. In postmenopausal women, alcohol increases the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone while lowering sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), potentially heightening the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, alcohol reduces testosterone and raises estrogen. This can contribute to infertility, low libido and even be a direct cause of erectile dysfunction. Alcohol also disrupts stress hormone (i.e. cortisol regulation) and can contribute to thyroid dysfunction as well as immune suppression. Most of these disruptions begin to normalize soon after alcohol cessation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diminished Immune Function Can Be Improved By Quitting Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol weakens both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It impairs neutrophil, macrophage, monocyte, and lymphocyte function while promoting chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a single episode of binge drinking can dampen immune responsiveness. Conversely, quitting alcohol has been shown to improve immune function within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Reduces Alcohol Health Risks And Increase Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is linked to premature death. A 2018 Lancet &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455599/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455599/" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that included data from nearly 600,000 people found that each additional daily drink reduced life expectancy by over a year. In men, each drink reduced lifespan by nearly one and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, despite its widespread social acceptance, alcohol is a known toxin that negatively affects nearly every system in the body. There are myriad, clear alcohol health risks that can be improved by quitting drinking altogether or lowering alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From increasing cancer risk, heart disease, and dementia, to disrupting sleep, hormones, and immunity, alcohol is far from the benign, daily drink it was once thought to be. As the science continues to evolve, one message grows louder: for those pursuing long-term vitality and resilience, quitting alcohol is not just wise. It’s evidence-based self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

And it turns out that those with the longest-lived citizens share one common trait: They consume more plant-based proteins. At least as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, the team at the Charles Perkins Center analyzed food supply and demographic data over a 60-year period (from 1961 to 2018) for 101 countries. The data encompassed information on the amount of food produced in each country as well as the average levels of calories, proteins, and fats available to citizens. The researchers also aimed to ensure that the selected countries were as regionally diverse as possible to reflect a variety of food systems and cuisines, including regions with higher animal protein consumption (notably, the U.S. and Australia) and areas where plants serve as the primary source of protein, such as Pakistan and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/daily-coffee-consumption-prolongs-lifespan-8768290" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Drinking Coffee Could Add Years to Your Life, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Drinking Coffee Could Add Years to Your Life, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the team corrected the data to "account for population size and wealth." In doing so, they found that "countries where overall availability of plant-based proteins were higher, such as India, had relatively longer life expectancies than countries where animal-based proteins were more readily available, such as the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In examining the data, they found an interesting subset of information. According to first author Caitlin Andrews, they discovered that the data indicated regions where children under five were fed more animal-based protein had lower infant mortality rates. However, she added, "for adults, the reverse was true, where plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release regarding their study, the researchers noted that there are plenty of other studies out there showcasing that plant proteins like those found in nuts, tofu, and legumes are associated with lower risks of chronic diseases, which could also explain why plant-loving places like Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda in California — home to the 7th Day Adventists who do not consume meat — are home to some of the longest-lived populations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you don't want to swear off animal-based protein forever, there are small changes you can make that could help add a few years to your life. Just a few weeks ago, researchers from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute released the findings of their study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which showed that making the simple swap from&lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/butter-vs-plant-based-oils-mortality-harvard-study-11705242" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: butter to plant-based oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; butter to plant-based oils&lt;/a&gt; like olive oil could help you live a bit longer, too. It found that participants who consumed the most butter had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who consumed the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny," Dr. Alistair Senior from the Charles Perkins Center study explained. "The knowledge that plant-based protein is associated with a longer life is really important as we consider not only how our diets impact our own longevity, but the health of the planet."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/plant-based-proteins-longevity-study-11718446" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:52:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFA0NkVNZFJMamR0VDBtNUFpdDJJR1poX2VvUkhidm9pLTYzeTdzcGtpam1KUFVZdjhSR00xM0I1aDVTeFp1OENEV0Y3WEcySTFJcGpKTG1lYmNmVjZKbFF4MWNCellNSUpoUnl1Q1dTVlg</guid></item><item><title>首先是蛋白质，然后是纤维。膳食排序背后的科学以及如何做到这一点。-雅虎 | First protein, then fiber.

Ingesting protein first also increases GLP-1 secretion (the same GLP-1 stimulated by &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/prescriptions-for-weight-loss-drugs-are-skyrocketing-especially-among-young-women-experts-think-they-know-why-100013729.html" data-ylk="slk:popular weight loss medications;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;popular weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt; like Ozempic), which plays a role in appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a powerful strategy for weight management, especially in midlife, when appetite signals can become dysregulated due to hormonal shifts,” says Sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It helps decrease food cravings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With better blood sugar control, you may experience fewer cravings. Rapid increases in blood sugar can trigger dopamine release, which makes you feel good. This can cause cravings for highly palatable foods that are high in fat and sugar and in some cases, can lead to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912158/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food addiction;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;food addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Stable blood sugars reduce hunger fluctuations and cravings for sweets or snacks,” Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal sequencing aids weight loss efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eating strategy may improve obesity thanks to enhanced GLP-1 secretion, which suppresses appetite and may reduce energy intake. So meal sequencing can be beneficial for those looking to lose weight.

Which is to say: It’s still pretty far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That’s not for lack of trying. Some researchers are attempting to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00183-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reprogram cells&lt;/a&gt; to make them biologically younger, which has been shown to reverse features of aging in older animals. Unfortunately, this can also induce cancer. Other researchers are studying drugs called &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637423001148" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which aim to clear aging cells out of the body. However, they can also destroy other cells humans need to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Transfusions of blood from young mice appear to rejuvenate older mice, but companies offering this unproven treatment for humans are charging a lot for a potentially dangerous therapy. And while some longevity enthusiasts are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/well/live/rapamycin-aging-longevity-benefits-risks.html" title=""&gt;taking the drug rapamycin&lt;/a&gt; because studies have shown it helps animals live longer, it also weakens the immune system and hasn’t been proved to work in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I find these efforts intriguing and worth pursuing. But most people don’t simply want to live until 110. They want to extend the amount of time they live free of serious disease, a concept known as health span. That’s why the most sensible approach is to reduce the toll of three major age-related diseases: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. It may be less flashy, but it’s more attainable than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s estimated that at least 80 percent of cardiovascular disease cases, 40 percent of cancer cases and 45 percent of Alzheimer’s cases are preventable. Even with a long lag — these diseases can each take 20 years or more to develop — researchers have struggled to accurately define a person’s risk early enough to intervene effectively. Sure, someone can take a genetic test and learn he’s at a heightened risk for Alzheimer’s disease, but what good is that if he doesn’t know whether the disease will emerge early, when he’s 95 or not at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the near future, doctors may not only be able to identify whether a person is at high risk for a serious, age-related disease, they may also be able to predict when that disease is most likely to manifest and how quickly it could progress. Several recent discoveries from the science of aging are making this increasingly possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was offered collagen water and I thought to myself, “Not another wellbeing fad.” But curiosity got the better of me, as it often does, so I thought, let’s see what the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen seems to be the staple of beauty regimes right now, especially for women and for those of us on the other side of 30. Whether we’re slapping collagen-infused creams onto our skin or gulping collagen-enriched supplements, there’s a huge demand for collagen as the proposed “elixir of youth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can drinking collagen water offer any health benefits? I decided to find out. Below, I cover what collagen is, the perceived health benefits and whether or not I’ve noticed any change since drinking it every day. Here’s what I’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-collagen-3"&gt;What is collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; describes collagen as the “primary building block of your body’s skin, muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments, and other connective tissues.” There’s even collagen in your blood vessels and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key amino acids that make up collagen include glycine, hydroxyproline and proline, and it’s made naturally by the body. As we age, and dependent on factors like alcohol intake, smoking and sun exposure, collagen production declines (sadly, this starts from 25), which is why consuming it is important and supplementation is so popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, like all supplements, there are questions on how effective collagen supplementation is and the best way to consume and absorb it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-exactly-does-collagen-do-for-you-3"&gt;What exactly does collagen do for you? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen helps maintain healthy skin and joints, improving the elasticity, hydration and appearance of your skin. Some &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; even looks promising for collagen supplementation and improving joint health and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/does-magnesium-help-muscle-recovery-one-expert-explains-all" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/does-magnesium-help-muscle-recovery-one-expert-explains-all"&gt;muscle recovery&lt;/a&gt;, which is particularly useful for anyone who enjoys working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5WuXHQ6ubiVoGwSocHM7Ek" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5WuXHQ6ubiVoGwSocHM7Ek slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research, like this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5793325/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5793325/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt; shows that specific collagen peptides may even help improve bone density, which also deteriorates as we age. However, this particular piece of research looked at animals rather than humans, so it is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s worth a reminder that aging happens whether you supplement with collagen or not. There’s no magic pill you can swallow to prevent the natural changes that come with getting older, so sadly, drinking collagen water every day isn’t taking away my eye crinkles — and I’m fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-ve-been-drinking-collagen-water-here-s-what-i-ve-learned-so-far-3"&gt;I’ve been drinking collagen water — here’s what I’ve learned so far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a woman in my thirties, I’ve seen just how popular collagen supplements have become, whether as a powder mixed into coffee, a pill, or added to drinks. Everyone seems to supplement collagen for the supposed skin and joint benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’ve found drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-haven-t-noticed-any-difference-yet"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I haven’t noticed any difference — yet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m only a few weeks in, and generally, it’s recommended that you supplement for a month or more before physically noticing any benefits to your body. That said, I’ve been adding collagen powder to my smoothies and coffees every day for years, and I haven’t noticed much difference in my skin or joint health. Still, here I am, drinking it daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-expensive"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's expensive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been drinking &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wearetide.com/products/tide-lemon-and-lime-collagen-water-250ml-12pk?variant=54518810378565" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://wearetide.com/products/tide-lemon-and-lime-collagen-water-250ml-12pk?variant=54518810378565" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Tide collagen water&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll cost you. Generally, while powders or supplements may cost more upfront, you’ll get at least 30 daily uses out of your purchase, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tide water contains bioavailable wild marine collagen peptides (cod, haddock and pollack), and each drink contains 3.5 grams of collagen, 1 gram of protein and claims to “Nourish skin, hair and nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, and dependent on factors like alcohol intake, smoking and sun exposure, collagen production declines, which is why consuming it is important and supplementation is so popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;General guidelines suggest a range between 2.5-15 grams of collagen daily to support joint, bone and muscle mass health and promote skin elasticity and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tide's collagen drinks are harvested sustainably from MSC-certified wild-caught fish, so with that in mind, the brand states the product is unsuitable for children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those who don’t consume fish or shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While powders and capsules may be seen as the best way to consume collagen, pre-made drinks have the benefit of convenience, requiring no mixing, so you can grab a can on the go as you rush off into the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-absorption-varies"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Absorption varies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most research, there are studies for and against the efficacy of supplementation. That said, most of the research I've found so far points to hydrolyzed collagen, high in peptides prolylhydroxyproline and hydroxyprolylglycine, as the best way to consume collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study posted to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6835901/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6835901/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; found improvements in skin hydration, elasticity and density following three months of supplementing with collagen compared to a placebo group. However, participants consumed a blend of 2.5 grams of collagen peptides, alongside acerola fruit extract, vitamin C, zinc, biotin and vitamin E complex, rather than collagen alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen must be absorbed into the gut after being broken down by the body, says &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/considering-collagen-drinks-and-supplements-202304122911" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/considering-collagen-drinks-and-supplements-202304122911" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;. Collagen is broken down into amino acids used for various bodily processes (including making proteins), so it’s widely considered that a powder or capsule taken orally is best. However, there are no guarantees that it'll directly impact your skin, hair and nails every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-didn-t-help-my-skin"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It didn't help my skin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't expecting much dermatologically. I usually break out in spots around certain points of my menstrual cycle, and just before my period, I get super dry skin. It's hard to track, but I plan to keep going for a few more months to see what, if anything, I notice about my skin and its appearance around my cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-foods-are-rich-in-collagen-3"&gt;Which foods are rich in collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals should help negate the need for supplementation. If you think you might need collagen supplements, it’s always best to speak with your healthcare professional to advise on dosage and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also find collagen in fish, egg whites and bone broths. Sources like leafy greens and berries can even provide vitamin C and antioxidants to help boost collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-good-to-take-collagen-every-day-3"&gt;Is it good to take collagen every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take collagen every day in the form of drinks, supplements, or foods, but I recommend doing your research and ensuring your collagen is high-quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage varies from person to person depending on personal requirements, including diet, lifestyle, health conditions, age and deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type I collagen (there’s also a type II and type III) is the most abundant and is considered the most beneficial, found in the skin, bones, tendons and so on. However, type II is found mostly in cartilage and is crucial for supporting your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bottom-line-my-verdict-3"&gt;Bottom line — my verdict&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are studies and emerging research on the benefits of collagen supplements, but so far — and granted, it hasn’t been long — I can’t see collagen water making much of a difference to my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I always say a balanced diet, plenty of water and exercise should be the top priority when looking after your skin, as well as sun protection and skincare, of course. That said, collagen water contributes toward your daily intake of water, offering benefits for skin hydration, but there isn’t enough research to convince me to use it instead of a great quality powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, your body can’t absorb collagen until it’s broken down, so I believe you’re better off using a high-quality hydrolyzed collagen powder or capsule than a collagen-infused water. It’s worth saying I’m neither a dietitian nor a nutritionist, so if you plan to supplement, I recommend speaking with a qualified health provider first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In April, researchers from the University of Sydney published a new study in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58475-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt; that highlights which countries have the longest life expectancies. And it turns out that those with the longest-lived citizens share one common trait: They consume more plant-based proteins. At least as adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To come to this conclusion, the team at the Charles Perkins Center analyzed food supply and demographic data over a 60-year period (from 1961 to 2018) for 101 countries. The data encompassed information on the amount of food produced in each country as well as the average levels of calories, proteins, and fats available to citizens. The researchers also aimed to ensure that the selected countries were as regionally diverse as possible to reflect a variety of food systems and cuisines, including regions with higher animal protein consumption (notably, the U.S. and Australia) and areas where plants serve as the primary source of protein, such as Pakistan and Indonesia.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Importantly, the team corrected the data to "account for population size and wealth." In doing so, they found that "countries where overall availability of plant-based proteins were higher, such as India, had relatively longer life expectancies than countries where animal-based proteins were more readily available, such as the U.S."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In examining the data, they found an interesting subset of information. According to first author Caitlin Andrews, they discovered that the data indicated regions where children under five were fed more animal-based protein had lower infant mortality rates. However, she added, "for adults, the reverse was true, where plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a release regarding their study, the researchers noted that there are plenty of other studies out there showcasing that plant proteins like those found in nuts, tofu, and legumes are associated with lower risks of chronic diseases, which could also explain why plant-loving places like Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda in California — home to the 7th Day Adventists who do not consume meat — are home to some of the longest-lived populations on the planet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you don't want to swear off animal-based protein forever, there are small changes you can make that could help add a few years to your life. Just a few weeks ago, researchers from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute released the findings of their study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which showed that making the simple swap from&lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/butter-vs-plant-based-oils-mortality-harvard-study-11705242" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; butter to plant-based oils&lt;/a&gt; like olive oil could help you live a bit longer, too. It found that participants who consumed the most butter had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who consumed the least. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny," Dr. Alistair Senior from the Charles Perkins Center study explained. "The knowledge that plant-based protein is associated with a longer life is really important as we consider not only how our diets impact our own longevity, but the health of the planet."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These hormones can increase blood sugar levels by prompting the liver to release more glucose into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Type 2 diabetes response:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In individuals with type 2 diabetes, stress often leads to elevated blood sugar levels. This is because stress hormones can make the body more resistant to insulin, hindering glucose uptake by cells. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/world-diabetes-day-how-diabetes-can-affect-your-mental-health-101636714847972.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="World Diabetes Day: How diabetes can affect your mental health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Diabetes Day: How diabetes can affect your mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Type 1 diabetes response:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with type 1 diabetes, stress can cause unpredictable blood sugar fluctuations. Some may experience increases, while others may see decreases, making management more challenging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Physical stressors:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness, injury, or surgery can act as physical stressors, leading to increased blood sugar levels. The body's stress response during these times can complicate diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Behavioural changes:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can influence behaviours that negatively impact blood sugar control. People might neglect their diabetes care routines, skip medications, make poor dietary choices, or reduce physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insulin resistance:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can contribute to insulin resistance, where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin. This condition is a significant factor in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emotional well-being:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent stress can lead to feelings of burnout, anxiety, or depression. These emotional states can further hinder diabetes management by reducing motivation and adherence to treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Monitoring challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can interfere with regular blood sugar monitoring. Individuals may forget to check their levels or misinterpret symptoms, leading to inadequate glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long-term complications:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmanaged stress and resulting high blood sugar levels can increase the risk of diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and kidney issues. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/diabetes-warning-stress-could-be-sabotaging-your-blood-sugar-here-s-how-to-fix-it-101738407141209.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Diabetes warning: Stress could be sabotaging your blood sugar.
