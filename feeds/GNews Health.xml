This concerning symptom prompted an emergency hospital visit, leading to a startling discovery that has fascinated medical professionals. Inside his kidney, doctors found a parasitic worm measuring approximately 30 centimeters in length, actively living within his renal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unusual case of urinary obstruction reveals shocking parasite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient displayed mostly normal vital signs, with the exception of mild tachycardia. Medical staff noted significant kidney swelling during their initial examination. Blood tests indicated a possible infection, leading the medical team to implement immediate treatment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors inserted a catheter to relieve the patient’s urinary retention and administered &lt;strong&gt;intravenous fluids along with antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; to address the suspected infection. The patient remained under observation overnight as medical staff monitored his condition closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning brought a disturbing revelation. The collection bag attached to the catheter contained blood-tinged urine—and swimming within this fluid was a long, thin parasite. This unexpected discovery explained the patient’s inability to urinate, as the creature had been physically obstructing his urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite measured approximately 30 centimeters in length with a width of 3-4 millimeters. Microbiological examination identified it as a male specimen of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt;, commonly known as the giant kidney worm—a rare parasitic infection in humans that perfectly matched the patient’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giant kidney worm infection: causes and transmission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; parasite represents one of the largest worms capable of infecting humans. These formidable parasites can survive up to five years within the kidney of their host, causing progressive damage to renal tissue and function over time. Female specimens can grow even more impressive in size, potentially exceeding one meter in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investigating the source of infection, doctors learned that the patient frequently consumed raw fish from a lake near his village. The patient confirmed this dietary habit and made a surprising admission—he had previously observed similar worms in his urine on other occasions, suggesting repeated infections despite the rarity of human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission cycle of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; typically involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs released into water through infected animal urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aquatic organisms like oligochaetes consuming these eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fish or amphibians ingesting infected intermediate hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans becoming infected through consumption of undercooked aquatic organisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of water in India represents a crucial factor in this case. Environmental contamination significantly increases the risk of parasitic infections from consuming raw or undercooked fish from local water bodies, as these environments may harbor various stages of the parasite’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical management and patient outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment approach for this patient involved both supportive care and monitoring. After the initial parasite was expelled “naturally” through the urinary tract, doctors recommended an extended hospital stay for observation. However, the patient elected to return home against medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more severe cases of &lt;strong&gt;kidney worm infestation&lt;/strong&gt;, surgical intervention may become necessary. The parasite can cause significant damage to renal tissue, potentially leading to kidney dysfunction or failure if left untreated. When multiple parasites are present or when they’ve embedded deeply into renal structures, surgical extraction offers the most definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symptom&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Potential Indication&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Medical Response&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inability to urinate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Physical obstruction of urinary tract&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Catheterization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood in urine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tissue damage from parasite&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Antibiotics, monitoring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kidney swelling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inflammatory response to infection&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Anti-inflammatory medication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abdominal pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite movement or tissue damage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pain management, parasite removal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical literature contains few documented human cases of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; infection, making this patient’s experience particularly noteworthy. Most infections occur in wild animals like mink, wolves, and dogs, with humans serving as accidental hosts when consuming contaminated food or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventive measures against parasitic infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual case highlights the importance of food safety practices, particularly when consuming fish and other aquatic organisms. Prevention strategies should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly cooking all fish and seafood before consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding raw fish dishes from unregulated or questionable sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being cautious about water quality, especially in regions with limited sanitation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking prompt medical attention for unusual urinary symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following regular deworming protocols in high-risk areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cases of human infection with &lt;strong&gt;giant kidney worms remain exceptionally rare&lt;/strong&gt;, they underscore the potential health risks associated with consuming raw or undercooked fish, particularly from freshwater sources in regions with suboptimal water quality. Understanding transmission patterns and maintaining vigilance regarding food preparation can help prevent such dramatic medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient’s previous encounters with similar parasites suggest that enhanced public health education in vulnerable communities could significantly reduce infection risks. By prioritizing food safety and seeking timely medical care for unusual symptoms, individuals can avoid the painful and potentially dangerous consequences of renal parasitic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

There are two types: HDL - the 'good' kind - and LDL - the 'bad' kind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;LDL can form plaques that buildup and block arteries, raising the risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke. HDL is meant to clear that by moving it from the bloodstream to the liver where it gets filtered out of the body. When HDL levels fall too low, LDL can build up unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists are now discovering the real danger isn't indulging in cholesterol-high foods and increasing LDL levels - a medical myth that has led to billions of dollars in pharmaceutical and fad diet sales across decades - it's actually when HDL levels fall too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that high cholesterol alone could drive up the risk of heart disease took off in the 1950s and was considered medical orthodoxy until recently, as more scientists have come to realize that Americans were fed a half-truth for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As it persisted, the diet industry continued to flourish. It helped spawn the $8.4 billion diet food market, produced multiple generations of cardiologists advising against cholesterol-rich foods and fueled &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13517837/statins-cholesterol-effects-heart-disease-aha-study.html"&gt;a $47 billion drug market&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, researchers are challenging that long-held belief, arguing cholesterol levels aren’t the medical ‘check engine light' they’ve long been made out to be and there are other ways to protect yourself that don't include skipping a steak dinner and taking a pill every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; For years, doctors have viewed high LDL cholesterol as a clear indicator of heart attack risk, often reacting urgently to extremely elevated levels. But some people with cholesterol levels between 200 and 500 mg/dL show no signs of artery clogging—so long as they are lean and healthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 million Americans have high cholesterol and 128 million have heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High LDL cholesterol has been linked to a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9316578/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9316578/"&gt;20 to 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; higher risk a death due to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And one in six Americans takes a statin - a class of cholesterol medications - to lower LDL, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13517837/statins-cholesterol-effects-heart-disease-aha-study.html"&gt;but millions may not&lt;/a&gt; actually need one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;LDL cholesterol has been vilified as 'bad' cholesterol for decades as multiple large-scale investigations showed links between high levels of the sticky substance and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1960s, the famous Framingham Heart Study revealed higher total cholesterol levels were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), which includes heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, early research made no distinction between large, buoyant LDL particles that move through the body without building up and forming plaques and the dense pellet-like LDL particles that more easily stick to artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And so the idea that cholesterol is a cause of heart disease dominated mainstream medicine for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers are beginning to understand that the medical field has drastically oversimplified cholesterol and its role in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows no link between LDL and plaque growth over one year in healthy people on the keto diet who were fit but started out with high LDL cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nick Norwitz, a specialist in metabolic disorder research, had been seeing a patient in her 60s for over 10 years who had dangerously high &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12602249/Im-cardiologist-Heres-NEVER-high-cholesterol.html"&gt;levels of ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her results were so high, in fact, that when doctors see numbers at those levels, they typically believe the lab made a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, his patient's tests weren't wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But what shocked Dr Norwitz was that despite her 'astronomical' cholesterol, 'she has no plaque whatsoever in her arteries,’ and was healthy overall, he told DailyMail.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Nick Norwitz is challenging the assumption that high cholesterol is a reliable warning sign for heart attack risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His patient was defying the laws of traditional medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Dr Norwitz has co-authored a study on very high cholesterol levels in healthy and fit adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These people followed a strict low-carb and high-fat keto diet, a diet doctors approach with caution over fears of increasing cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers found no evidence of worsening artery plaque, a key indicator of heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Norwitz has found extremely high cholesterol alone might not be as influential in driving heart disease as scientists have long thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people with shockingly high cholesterol that would prompt quick action from a doctor showed zero &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14011453/Subtle-signs-legs-high-cholesterol-heart-attack-risk-peripherial-artery-disease-Howie-Mandel.html"&gt;artery clogging&lt;/a&gt; over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there was a caveat: these people were lean, healthy, and followers of the keto diet, a meal plan much loved in the corner of the wellness field that centers on boosting testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had perfect blood sugar, sky-high ‘good’ HDL cholesterol, and virtually no inflammation. Instead of being a heart attack warning sign, soaring LDL was a harmless byproduct of their body burning fat for fuel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;High cholesterol is still risky for people with obesity, diabetes, or insulin resistance, as well as people with certain genetic disorders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cholesterol myth helped fuel a flourishing $20 billion market of statin drugs that lower blood cholesterol by blocking an enzyme in the liver that produces it and increasing the number of LDL receptors on cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Norwitz's &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101686"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;found that, unlike people with genetic cholesterol disorders —where faulty metabolism leads to dangerous arterial clogging — these keto dieters with high LDL cholesterol were metabolically pristine, without signs of obesity, diabetes, or insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 100 dieters in Dr Norwitz’s study showed their liver was producing large, buoyant LDL particles that were less likely to stick to artery walls than the typical waxy cholesterol that forms dangerous plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants also had fully functioning LDL receptors and didn't need to be put on a statin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101686"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101686"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;concluded not all LDL cholesterol is equal and is not a standalone predictor of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the absence of blaming LDL for heart disease, other contributors could be genetics, smoking, inactivity, high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Norwitz told DailyMail.com: ‘We focus in medicine a lot on biomarkers we can act upon, that we have drugs for, rather than things like overall metabolic health. So, for better or worse, LDL cholesterol has been the focus, and there's just a big assumption built in that it alone is sufficient to drive cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But we've never had a human population where they only have high LDL, they're metabolically healthy, and they don't have an underlying genetic cause.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: ‘One paper can't overturn [this prevailing idea], but it exposes a major blind spot and the prevailing model because if you can have a population of patients with cholesterol this high who, as a population, aren't at very high risk for heart disease, it means there's something we're missing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So she felt it was a cruel twist of fate when she contracted a rare neurological disease that took away her ability to speak and left her paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Abraham, 45 from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-c1c51da0-1c8e-11f0-864e-fb0d2908420c"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, had spent over 15 years helping children overcome speech obstacles and teaching them how to talk, but in March 2019, her life came to a standstill after she began to experience a severe case of the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-d5202c30-1bc8-11f0-824d-096c5aadc1b7" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She suffered from extreme exhaustion, body aches, nausea and vomiting, and soon, her voice began to wane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was quickly taken to her local emergency room but within two days had to be moved to the intensive care unit after facing respiratory failure and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sport/mlb/article-14544407/Freddie-Freemans-wife-shares-vital-health-update-son-4-amid-battle-heartbreaking-rare-disease.html"&gt;progressive paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Abraham wasn't a stranger to the ICU, having treated patients in the hospital rooms during her career. But now, she was the patient.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-one told DailyMail.com: 'In the ICU, I was unable to move my arm or hold my head up. The neck muscles were so weak that my neck basically fell to the side, and I had to use a neck brace to hold it up. My condition was grave to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was a speech-language pathologist unable to communicate verbally.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vanessa Abraham, a 45-year-old mother, had spent over 15 years helping children overcome speech obstacles and teaching them how to talk when one day, she lost her own voice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some believed she was suffering from the central nervous system disorder multiple sclerosis, others thought she had neuromyelitis optica (a rare autoimmune disorder that also affects the CNS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she would go a year without a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that didn't stop her from healing. She told DailyMail.com she fought as hard as she could for her four-year-old daughter, scared she would never be able to speak to the little girl again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was a speech-language pathologist unable to communicate verbally... so I had to rely on things like eye gaze and movements, letters on an alphabet board or paper to type on and text to speech app on my phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, she required a tracheostomy, which creates an opening in the windpipe to insert a tube to help oxygen reach the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, she also required a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A PMV is a speaking valve designed to facilitate communication for people with tracheostomies or those on ventilators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It redirects airflow through the vocal cords, mouth, and nose, enabling speech and improving communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her condition worsened, experts continued to look for answers, but came up empty. Despite this, Mrs Abraham began intensive 'natural' rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'For my recovery, I took the most natural approaches I could find. I did acupuncture, cranial sacral therapy, chiropractic treatments, endermologie [massage with a device that promotes blood circulation], stretch therapy and lasers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I completely avoided any prescription medications to address pain. However, I did do monthly infusions of IVIG [antibodies] per my neurologists recommendation as there was no way possible I would experience any medical complications or side effects from this form of medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also worked with another speech pathologist in the ICU, as well as during rehab to regain her voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As months went by, she started to &lt;span&gt;slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move and was eventually sent home - still without a diagnosis - and was told to see a neurologist in hopes of finding answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated. Eventually I required a tracheostomy and utilized a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication,' she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She claims that her greatest motivation was her then-four-year-old daughter whom she feared she would never speak to again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then by June 2019, Mrs Abraham visited a new neurologist at the University of California in San Diego who recognized her symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'It was not until a few months after exiting the hospital environment that they finally diagnosed me. It was only because I saw a new neurologist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'That neurologist was able to diagnose me in a few minutes based off what I was presenting with [cervical, brachial, pharyngeal paralysis]. She said she had seen this before in her career and was very confident I had the PCB-Variant of GB.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mrs Abraham was diagnosed with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) variant, a rare form of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;GBS is a rare neurological disorder in which the patient's immune system mistakenly attacks part of their peripheral nerves, responsible for sending information from the brain to different body parts and back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition typically starts to spread from the feet and legs and travels to the arms and face. However in Mrs Abraham's case, it began in her face and then went down her body - making it difficult for doctors to diagnose her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'In the ICU they tested me for GBS but quickly dismissed it because my variant took a different course to paralysis. Typical variants ascend from the feet up, and mine took the opposite - it went top down (head to feet).'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PCB variant of GBS causes rapid weakness in muscles of the mouth and throat, cervical spine in the neck and nerves in the shoulder.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also causes a complete absence of reflexes in the upper limbs and arms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Significant weakness in the mouth and throat can make it difficult to talk, swallow, chew and breathe. It can also cause a person to slur their speech, drool out of the mouth and lead to facial paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weakness in the neck and shoulder make it hard to hold the head up and nerve problems - all symptoms Mrs Abraham was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As months went by, she started to slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Abraham pictured here with her husband as she spent time in rehab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to BMJ Journals, most neurologists are unfamiliar with the PCB variant and often misdiagnose it as brainstem stroke, myasthenia gravis (a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue) or botulism (fatal poisoning and paralysis caused by a bacteria). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The causes of both GBS and its variants remain unknown, though they are believed to be triggered by an immune system response to an infection. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13100755/Largest-Covid-vaccine-study-finds-shots-linked-small-increased-risk-neurological-blood-heart-disorders-extremely-rare.html"&gt;GBS has also been linked to the Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is diagnosed in about one in 78,000 people each year around the world. About one in 100,000 people are affected in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for GBS or any of its variants, therapies such as plasma exchange and immunoglobulin injections (proteins that your immune system naturally makes to attack invading organisms) can help alleviate symptoms and reduce recovery time if started within two weeks of developing GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS and healthcare professionals tend to transfer patients to rehabilitation settings to improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham, who is now able to speak clearly and walk, said: '&lt;span&gt;Recovery was awful, long and required a lot of mental health services to address severe depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was unable to drive for nine months and eat for six. I didn't work for a year. I had a lot of pain and discomfort and exhaustion. I napped daily and spent a lot of time in outpatient rehab, at the gym, resting, and in therapy for depression.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also revealed how she managed to interacte with people while re-learning how to speak: 'I communicated with a passy muir valve that is a device that is used with a tracheostomy. It was the most exhausting, scary and difficult procedure I have ever been through in my entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to the nature of my disease, it made talking again hard. I had an extremely high level of secretions that would require a lot of suctioning in order to use the PMV and talk again. It was physically exhausting. The first time I used the PMV I was able to only use it for less than a minute because it was so hard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Before the PMV I used every other modality as an SLP I could think of to talk. I pointed to pictures, typed on the letter board and when severe and unable to move anything in my body I used eye gaze.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham is now able to speak clearly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her recovery, Mrs Abraham told DailyMail.com that her illness forever changed her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: '&lt;span&gt;I lost myself. I lost who I once was and had to say goodbye to many dreams for my future. I was profoundly depressed and missed myself and wanted to be the mom I envisioned I would be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I am not as active as I once was. I was once able to run, hike mountains for miles and ride bikes and participate in yoga classes. I have had to stop doing all of that because I am simply not strong enough and cannot perform these tasks safely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Being tube fed was depressing and isolating. I was no longer able to sit at the table and eat with my family. That is isolating. I was no longer able to work. I lost my identify as not only a mom and wife but also a SLP/working mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I no longer felt I fit into the world I once was an active participant in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for life now, she told DailyMail.com she still struggles - both physically and mentally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'I am six years out and still participate in weekly ICU support groups for PICS [post intensive care syndrome].

Of course, there are lots of ways to improve your gut health, and some exciting new research is now suggesting that adding a very specific type of juice to your morning routine could help boost your gut health by tamping down gut inflammation. For the roughly 60 million Americans who struggle with gastrointestinal diseases, these findings could even prove life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the study found, plus what gastroenterologists want you to keep in mind when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/15/2/306" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, focused on patients with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a37144670/ulcerative-colitis-counting-macros-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that causes stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers randomly assigned 35 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 to take either a 130 milliliter tart cherry drink made with 100 milliliters of water and 30 milliliters of concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a60329891/tart-cherry-juice-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tart cherry juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; or a placebo drink (that had a similar look and taste) twice a day for six weeks. The participants continued to take their usual ulcerative colitis medications during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a bunch of measurements during the study, including looking at the participants’ physical and mental health, and ulcerative colitis symptoms. The participants also gave regular blood and stool samples, and kept food diaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that people in the tart cherry drink group had a 40 percent reduction in calprotectin, a protein that’s released when there’s inflammation in the gut. Participants in the tart cherry drink group also reported a 9 percent improvement in their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trial indicates that twice-daily tart cherry supplementation can improve irritable bowel disorder-related quality of life as well as the severity of symptoms and therefore may be important in the management of ulcerative colitis,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does an inflamed gut affect your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut inflammation causes more than just intestinal discomfort, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it can cause lots of issues with your overall health, including joint pain, feeling tired or fatigued, dysbiosis [an imbalance of gut bacteria], or malabsorption, she says. It can also lead to worse symptoms of lactose intolerance or fructan sensitivity, Dr. Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating the underlying cause of the disease is important— avoiding gluten for Celiac disease patients, calming inflammation with medication for irritable bowel disease patients, and eating a healthy diet and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics for those with gut [imbalance],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s really important to take care of your gut, says &lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “When the gut is inflamed, there’s a lot of inflammation throughout the body,” he says. “It causes a lot of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does tart cherry juice help reduce inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that this study was only done on a small group of people, and it was also funded by the Cherry Marketing Institute, a non-profit group that represents American cherries. (However, the organization didn’t influence the design of the study or the results.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few theories on why this drink may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tart cherries have polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant compounds that act as antioxidants, and which may help tamp down on inflammation, Dr. Stein says. “Some other theories suggest that there is a prebiotic effect of this substance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can also just take these findings at face value, because there is a lot of information to show that the juice reduces inflammation in the group that took it compared to the placebo,” Dr. Farhadi says. “But we really have to take this with a grain of salt because there were only a few participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein stresses that, at this point, more data is needed to prove this connection, since most studies on tart cherry juice are small and results have been mixed. “There is nothing truly convincing that this particular food is the key to all health,” she says. “That said, it probably tastes good and in moderation is a healthy food to consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much would I have to drink to see the positive effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much. This particular study had people drink 130 milliliters of a tart cherry drink twice a day, which is a little less than 4.5 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to reduce gut inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research into the potential impact of tart cherry juice on the gut is ongoing, doctors say there are a few things you can do to lower levels of inflammation in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein suggests having a regular exercise routine, eating a healthy diet with fiber from natural sources, getting plenty of good quality sleep, trying to reduce chronic stress, and focusing on your overall health. “Eating a balanced diet with healthy foods and less processed foods also seems to help, like the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60617751/mediterranean-diet-lowers-hypertension-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:23:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9kNlplS09tQTFmaEI3bzdJNXJrMU1LWENPODQzWTR3NFdwWERHWU9TZFZKQW5zNU1RMDFVR3BFLXBxdm1FQzA3eUhrQVBUUGRQUHNRWnNaUFd3RWsxZV9UbGRSVlRPaUxzTEl2Nk9TclRXU2tZRF9BYU5LcU84QQ</guid></item><item><title>像Ozempic这样的流行减肥药物可能会引发抑郁症，医生警告- SciTechDaily | Popular Weight Loss Drugs Like Ozempic May Trigger Depression, Doctors Warn - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNWDd3SmlnWUl6VzRtOHotVzV0RjhoUkR3UkFsLXY5bE9kZFNWbXpPMmtId21SSEJFN1lKVWF5SGlQNHVacVVYaGtFQmM5TkJ2R01rOUFWcVZrNUtGLXpuVXZoRmJtX0VnYmo3Y25yMTZtYjBob19rMjJLRzRLb0JuanV3ak8talBLTUhqVHc2b3lUMTB0c3NMYjRSSmJQQlhrU1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:06:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNWDd3SmlnWUl6VzRtOHotVzV0RjhoUkR3UkFsLXY5bE9kZFNWbXpPMmtId21SSEJFN1lKVWF5SGlQNHVacVVYaGtFQmM5TkJ2R01rOUFWcVZrNUtGLXpuVXZoRmJtX0VnYmo3Y25yMTZtYjBob19rMjJLRzRLb0JuanV3ak8talBLTUhqVHc2b3lUMTB0c3NMYjRSSmJQQlhrU1E</guid></item><item><title>这款被忽视的身体废物产品被证明对医学研究有用- ScienceAlert | This Overlooked Bodily Waste Product Is Proving Useful For Medical Research - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNX0xHOVhIZmlEaURHTGZ6cmJGMU9qZGpRQUpPcmE5cmVDc1hYRHlUYUJ4VW03MjBFM1dydG42OEI5Um5SWkREOTNxYWs5VFc5eVptanNDaXlOb3ZiV292cFB5N2tPcG1icmxHOXZkam4xUXZEdXRlX2JOYzdSVF9tWjAxaWg4UHE2SXBJeUVvemlIZnF0TzNiWGNxNXZoZndvZmFORVZxcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood has historically been overlooked in research – considered only to be a &lt;a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjsrh/2021/11/18/menstrual-blood-no-longer-just-a-waste-product/"&gt;waste product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood actually has a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;rich cellular and molecular makeup&lt;/a&gt;. It contains immune cells, stems cells and endometrial cells – as well as metabolites such as proteins and lipids (fat). This makes menstrual blood a potential goldmine for insights into many different health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a less invasive way for researchers to access important biological material without the need for surgical biopsies or other invasive techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its important composition, researchers are now using menstrual blood to investigate whether it can be used to uncover the causes of a disease, identify signs of a health condition and develop personalized treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where menstrual blood could be integral is research investigating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/endometriosis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73093" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;. This condition causes endometrial tissue (which normally lines the uterus) to grow outside of the womb and on other organs, such as the bowel and ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into endometriosis is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-01475-2/index.html"&gt;severely underfunded&lt;/a&gt;, despite it affecting &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis"&gt;10 percent of women&lt;/a&gt;. It's also difficult to understand the mechanisms behind the disease without using invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, current treatment options – which include surgical lesion removal, hormonal contraceptives and pain relief – fail to address the root cause or associated complications (such as infertility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some researchers have managed to develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02194-y"&gt;using the endometrial cells from menstrual blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoids are miniature, lab-grown 3D models of organs derived from the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; found in the blood. These organoids can mimic what happens in the actual endometrium (the innermost lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives researchers a non-invasive way to investigate the health status of the endometrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing organoids from the menstrual blood of those suffering with endometriosis, researchers are able to model the disease in the lab. This may one day lead the way to better understanding the underlying mechanisms of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is also considered to be an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836207/"&gt;inflammatory condition&lt;/a&gt;. This is because there's an over-activation of the immune system seen in people with endometriosis, which worsens symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, an area of high interest for research into endometriosis is the study of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood contains &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249743/"&gt;live immune cells&lt;/a&gt; which have come from the reproductive tract. These immune cells offer insight into the inflammation that's occurring in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may help researchers better understand and develop treatments for painful sex, a common symptom for people with endometriosis which is &lt;a href="https://www.endofound.org/painful-sex-dyspareunia"&gt;linked to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presence of endometrial cells makes it an ideal tool for studying endometriosis, menstrual blood is also being used to offer insights into other reproductive diseases. For example, it has unveiled immune differences in patients with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35560014/"&gt;recurrent pregnancy loss&lt;/a&gt; that was not previously detectable using blood from the vein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stem cell research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;contains stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it an important resource for research into a variety of other health conditions – including those involved in critical processes such as &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57"&gt;cardiovascular function, respiration and nervous system function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells are defined by their naive status and ability to become a new, specialized type of cell under the right conditions. Adult stem cells are usually taken from umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, bone marrow or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it requires invasive techniques to extract a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; sample from these areas – and only small amounts can be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood, a fluid which is typically produced monthly, has been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; that are also capable of differentiating into various other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly exciting as menstrual blood is readily available, naturally regenerates and collecting it does not require any surgical procedures or discomfort. This makes it a convenient and ethical option for stem cell research and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg" alt="This Overlooked Waste Product Is Proving Useful For Medical Research" class="size-full wp-image-158631" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Menstrual blood is even being used to monitor blood sugar levels. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEXEmmlehs/"&gt;Nataliya Vaitkevich/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from using these menstrual blood-derived stem cells to investigate reproductive diseases such as &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/20/9/905/2459769?login=true"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, there are also several studies looking at using these cells in other applications. For example, researchers have used them to investigate techniques for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656863/"&gt;promoting wound healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2013.0390"&gt;improving blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of diabetes, menstrual blood is also being used for a proof-of-concept study to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759003/"&gt;monitor glycaemic control&lt;/a&gt;. This offers alternatives to traditional blood tests – such as &lt;a href="https://qvin.com/"&gt;the Q pad&lt;/a&gt;, a pad which contains a removable collection strip for blood testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other diseases which are showing promising results in being diagnosed through menstrual blood include &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377370/"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11427561/"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; and diseases associated with &lt;a href="https://sciforschenonline.org/journals/clinical-laboratory-medicine/JCLM130.php"&gt;lipid levels&lt;/a&gt; – such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood is gaining traction in research due to its novelty and because it's a less invasive way to collect different cells and molecules for testing. It's easily accessible as a monthly "waste" product, and allows women to collect samples themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could bypass the need for doctors and nurses and the inconvenience of appointments if it becomes a more reliable diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite its promise, there are practical challenges that researchers face. Discussion around menstrual blood is still &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dirty-red-how-periods-have-been-stigmatised-through-history-to-the-modern-day-206967"&gt;sometimes seen as taboo&lt;/a&gt;. Some women may not feel comfortable handling their own blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also inconsistencies with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;how menstrual blood is collected&lt;/a&gt; between studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, studies which only required a smaller volume of menstrual blood have been able to make use of sanitary pads and tampons to collect samples. However, those which require a larger sample used menstrual cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue with this is that the products used have different compositions, which can interfere with the reliability of the results. Another issue lies predominantly with menstrual cups and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11205264/"&gt;lack of knowledge&lt;/a&gt; surrounding their proper use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, addressing stigma and promoting awareness around menstrual blood research is vital. While it has historically been overlooked, menstrual blood must now be recognized as a powerful, non-invasive tool in advancing research.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253384/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a title="Grist" href="https://grist.org"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up for Grist’s &lt;a title="Weekly newsletter" href="https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;amp;utm_source=partner"&gt;weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Throughout the Yangtze River Delta, a region in southern China famed for its widespread rice production, farmers grow belts of slender green stalks. Before they reach several feet tall and turn golden brown, the grassy plants soak in muddy, waterlogged fields for months. Along the rows of submerged plants, levees store and distribute a steady supply of water that farmers source from nearby canals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;This traditional practice of flooding paddies to raise the notoriously thirsty crop is almost as old as the ancient grain’s domestication. Thousands of years later, the agricultural method continues to predominate in rice cultivation practices from the low-lying fields of Arkansas to the sprawling terraces of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As the planet heats up, this popular process of growing rice is becoming increasingly more dangerous for the millions of people worldwide that eat the grain regularly, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. After drinking water, the researchers say, rice is the world’s second largest dietary source of inorganic arsenic, and climate change appears to be increasing the amount of the highly toxic chemical that is in it. If nothing is done to transform how most of the world’s rice is produced, regulate how much of it people consume, or mitigate warming, the authors conclude that communities with rice-heavy diets could begin confronting increased risks of cancer and disease as soon as 2050.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Our results are very scary,” said Donming Wang, the ecological doctorate student at the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the paper. “It’s a disaster … and a wake-up call.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Back in 2014, Wang and an international team of climate, plant, and public health scientists started working together on a research project that would end up taking them close to a decade to complete. Wading through rice paddies across the Yangtze Delta, they sought to find out just how projected temperatures and levels of atmospheric CO2 in 2050 would interact with the arsenic in the soil and the rice crops planted there. They knew, from past research, that the carcinogen was a problem in rice crops, but wanted to find out how much more of an issue it might be in a warming world. The team didn’t look at just any rice, but some of the grain varieties most produced and consumed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Although there are &lt;a href="https://www.riceassociation.org.uk/types-of-rice"&gt;an estimated 40,000 types of rice&lt;/a&gt; on the planet, they tend to be grouped into three categories based on length of the grain. Short-grain rice, or the sticky kind often used in sushi; long-grain, which includes aromatic types like basmati and jasmine; and medium-grain, or rice that tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/types-of-rice?srsltid=AfmBOop6Nx25mqFpHopqAD6gC-ZdLve2kvlZ8nEYym0Dfl8RwLT2cIxb"&gt;served as a main dish&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, the short-to-medium japonica and long-grain indica are the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.857896/full"&gt;two major subspecies of cultivated rice&lt;/a&gt; eaten across Asia. Wang’s study modelled the growth of 28 varieties of japonica, indica, and hybrid rice strains central to cuisine for seven of the continent’s top rice consuming and producing countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. India, Vietnam, and China are among the group of &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/rice/trade#:~:text=Despite%20its%20current%20export%20restrictions,of%20annual%20global%20rice%20exports."&gt;eight nations&lt;/a&gt; that lead the rest of the world in rice exports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;After nearly a decade of observing and analyzing the growth of the plants, the researchers discovered that the combination of higher temperatures and CO2 encourages root growth, increasing the ability of rice plants to uptake arsenic from the soil. They believe this is because climate-related changes in soil chemistry that favor arsenic can be more easily absorbed into the grain. Carbon-dioxide enriched crops were found to capture more atmospheric carbon and pump some of that into the soil, stimulating microbes that are making arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The more root growth, the more carbon in the soil, which can be a source of food for soil bacteria that multiply under warming temperatures. When soil in a rice paddy is waterlogged, oxygen gets depleted, causing the soil bacteria to rely further on arsenic to generate energy. The end result is more arsenic building up in the rice paddy, and more roots to take it up to the developing grain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;These arsenic-accumulating effects linked to increased root growth and carbon capture is a paradoxical surprise to Corey Lesk, a Dartmouth College postdoctoral climate and crop researcher unaffiliated with the paper. The paradox, said Lesk, is that both of these outcomes have been talked about as potential benefits to rice yields under climate change. “More roots could make the rice more drought-resistant, and cheaper carbon can boost yields generally,” he said. “But the extra arsenic accumulation could make it hard to realize health benefits from that yield boost.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Arsenic comes in many different forms. Notoriously toxic, inorganic arsenic — compounds of the element that don’t contain carbon — is what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic"&gt;classifies&lt;/a&gt; as a “confirmed carcinogen” and “the most significant chemical contaminant in drinking water globally.” Such forms of arsenic are &lt;a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/toxmetal/arsenic/the-facts-on-arsenic/"&gt;typically more toxic&lt;/a&gt; to humans because they are less stable than their organic counterparts and may allow arsenic to interact with molecules that ramp up exposure. Chronic exposure has been linked to lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as heart disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy, neurodevelopmental issues, and weakened immune systems, among other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Scientists and public-health specialists have known for years that the presence of arsenic in food is a mounting threat, but dietary exposure has long been considered much less of a risk in comparison to contaminated groundwater. So policy measures to mitigate the risk have been slow going. The few existing standards that have been enacted by the European Union and China, for example, are considered inconsistent and largely unenforced. No country has formally established regulations for organic arsenic exposure in foods. (In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has established &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/chemical-metals-natural-toxins-pesticides-guidance-documents-regulations/supporting-document-action-level-inorganic-arsenic-rice-cereals-infants"&gt;an action level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal&lt;/a&gt;, but that recommendation for manufacturers isn’t an enforceable regulation on arsenic in rice or any other food.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Wang hopes to see this change. The levels of inorganic arsenic commonly found in rice today fall within China’s recommended standards, for example, but her paper shows that lifetime bladder and lung cancer incidences are likely to increase “proportionally” to exposure by 2050. Under a “worst case” climate scenario, where global temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and are coupled with CO2 levels that increase another &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/humans-didnt-exist-the-last-time-there-was-this-much-co2-in-the-air/"&gt;200 parts per million&lt;/a&gt;, the levels of inorganic arsenic in the rice varieties studied are projected to surge by a whopping 44 percent. That means that more than half the rice samples would exceed China’s current proposed limit, which limits 200 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in paddy rice, with an estimated 13.4 million cancers linked to rice-based arsenic exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Because these health risks are in part calculated based on body weight, infants and young children will face the biggest health burdens. Babies, in particular, may end up facing outsize risks through the consumption of rice cereals, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“You’re talking about a crop staple that feeds billions of people, and when you consider that more carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures can significantly influence the amount of arsenic in that staple, the amount of health consequences related to that are, for lack of a better word, enormous,” said study coauthor Lewis Ziska, a plant biologist researching climate change and public health at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;But everyone should not suddenly stop eating rice as a result, he added. Though the team found the amount of inorganic arsenic in rice is higher than a lot of other plants, it’s still quite low overall. The key variable is how much rice a person eats. If you are among the bulk of the world that consumes rice multiple times a week, this looming health burden could apply to you, but if you do so more sporadically, Ziska says, the inorganic arsenic you may end up exposed to won’t be “a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In that way, the study’s projections may also deepen existing global and social inequities, as a big reason rice has long reigned as one of the planet’s most devoured grains is because it’s also among the most affordable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Beyond mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions — what Ziska calls “waving my rainbows, unicorns, and sprinkles wand” — adaptation efforts to avoid a future with toxic rice include rice paddy farmers planting earlier in the season to avoid seeds developing under warmer temperatures, better soil management, and plant breeding to minimize rice’s propensity to accumulate so much arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Water-saving irrigation techniques such as alternate wetting and drying, where paddy fields are first flooded and then allowed to dry in a cycle, could also be used to reduce these increasing health risks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the grain’s enormous methane footprint. On a global scale, rice production accounts for roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html"&gt;8 percent of all methane emissions from human activity&lt;/a&gt; — flooded paddy fields are ideal conditions for &lt;a href="https://climateandhealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MethaneReport-Ag-FINAL.pdf"&gt;methane-emitting bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“This is an area that I know is not sexy, that doesn’t have the same vibe as the end of the world, rising sea levels, category 10 storms,” said Ziska. “But I will tell you quite honestly that it will have the greatest effect in terms of humanity, because we all eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/"&gt;https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/&lt;/a&gt;.

That ambulance took her to Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, which is only a four-minute drive away from the Albrights’ home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hospital the two had been to before — he had previously been hospitalized there after a stroke, and his wife had surgery done there, Rick Albright told The Beacon-News. He said the two had long been cared for by doctors with Advocate Health Care, a non-profit medical group with a large presence in Aurora, and when they previously went to Mercy Medical Center, Advocate doctors were there to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the two arrived at Mercy Medical Center’s emergency room on Christmas Eve in 2023 and learned she had a gastric issue, they were told that her Advocate gastroenterologist, the same one who had previously operated on her at that same hospital, would not be able to see her, according to Rick Albright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it was the first time he’d heard that Advocate doctors may not be able to see them at Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the on-call doctor did a great job, eventually doing surgery to remove some gallstones, it was “completely luck of the draw,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of stories could become more common now that Advocate has pulled its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center without broadly informing its patients of the change. Around a half-dozen people who currently work or recently stopped working at Mercy confirmed to The Beacon-News that Advocate doctors were being pulled from Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to The Beacon-News, Advocate said that it is “shifting all hospital-based services to Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove and surrounding hospitals,” which is being done to “provide the best and highest quality care for our patients where they need it most” and “help us continue to coordinate and integrate care for our patients who need hospital-based services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the care Advocate provides to its patients takes place at its clinics, the locations of which are not changing, according to the statement from Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;When an Advocate spokesperson was asked when and how patients are being notified of this change, they said it is being done “as part of the scheduling process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/03/01/ascension-completes-sale-of-9-illinois-hospitals-to-prime-healthcare-for-more-than-370-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bought Mercy Medical Center along with a number of other hospitals from Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, also confirmed that Advocate Heath has decided to “prohibit their physicians from continuing to provide care at our hospital.” However, there is currently “no impact to the hospital’s emergency care and no impact to patient care or access,” a Mercy spokesperson recently told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare asked Advocate to reconsider its decision, but “our efforts were declined,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight Advocate cardiologists, the last Advocate physicians at the hospital, were officially pulled out of Mercy Medical Center on April 5, according to the Mercy spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate previously offered other types of care at Mercy — including ENT, pulmonology, urology, and hospitalist care — but those doctors were pulled out ahead of Prime’s purchase of the hospital, the Mercy spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Vitale, a certified registered nurse anesthetist who has been working at Mercy Medical Center for about 15 years, said that Advocate general surgeons and gastroenterologists were among the first to go. Both have been gone for over a year, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Advocate Health Care doctors were pulled out late last year or the start of this year, including orthopedics; ear, nose and throat doctors; pulmonology; urology; critical care doctors; podiatry and hospitalists, according to Richa Sharma, a doctor who up until Feb. 14 worked in Mercy Medical Center’s intensive care unit and was the hospital’s chair of internal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma and Vitale, neither of whom work for Advocate Health, were among those who agreed to come forward publicly to confirm Advocate was pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma said that Advocate hospitalists used to make up between 30% and 50% of all the hospitalists working at Mercy Medical Center. Hospitalists act as general doctors and coordinate care among other physicians for patients in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Mercy Medical Center’s surgical care also used to come from Advocate Health Care, according to Vitale. While she has seen a lot of changes in administration at Mercy over the years, she has never seen anything like this, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to confirm which types of Advocate doctors no longer work at Mercy Medical Center, an Advocate spokesperson referred to the company’s statement on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specialist departments at Mercy Medical Center were hit harder by Advocate’s pull-out than others. Sharma told The Beacon-News late last year that the group she works for — Sound Physicians — was contracted to provide 50% of critical care at Mercy, while the other half came from Advocate Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare decided to go with a different group for critical care services, which is why Sharma no longer works at Mercy, she told The Beacon-News last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s pulmonology, orthopedic surgery and ear, nose and throat departments used to also be staffed primarily by Advocate doctors, according to Sharma. But, she said late last year that there was another group already providing podiatry services at Mercy, and they were going to continue, so “that wouldn’t be a huge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, Sharma said at the time, was that Advocate pulling out of Mercy Medical Center was an additional layer of instability on top of the instability caused by Prime’s purchase of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Prime now says it has closed any gaps left by Advocate pulling out its doctors, Sharma said in January that the hospital was having to make deals with other local hospitals to take patients because of gaps in coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the anticipated effects are playing out currently,” Sharma said in January about Advocate pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, deals were still being worked out with groups to cover orthopedics and urology, there was no pulmonology coverage and there were questions around ear, nose and throat coverage, she said in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Albright called the situation “silly” when he spoke to The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re the second biggest city in Illinois, and Advocate, who I’ve been involved with since they were Dreyer, they’re trying to send us all over the place for our procedures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Rose Anne Albright had wanted to see her own Advocate doctor that Christmas Eve after being examined while in great pain at Mercy Medical Center, the same hospital where her Advocate doctor previously handled her surgery, she would have needed to take another ambulance to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, which “makes no sense at all and is extremely expensive,” Rick Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those with Advocate doctors are still able to come get procedures done at Mercy, it would be out of network for them, Sharma told The Beacon-News. She said that means procedures may be more costly and harder to get approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center provides care to an “underserved community,” and many local residents are no longer going to have access to hospital care within their own community if they are patients of Advocate Health Care and do not have the means to travel beyond the city, according to Vitale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern of Vitale’s is that, as Mercy Medical Center loses doctors, quality staff may also be lost. She also wonders if Mercy will be able to maintain the same standard of care that the hospital has provided over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loves the hospital, she said, and thinks it is a unique place that has maintained a community and family feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s strategically in a great location. It’s in the middle of a large community of people,” Vitale said about Mercy Medical Center. “I feel like this community needs that resource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate Health Care has similarly pulled doctors out of Rush Copley Medical Center, the other hospital in Aurora, but that process has been more gradual than what happened at Mercy, Rush Copley’s President and CEO John Diederich told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Advocate doctors used to make up around 50% of Rush Copley’s patient care revenue, but that has been dropping since then, falling to around 35% in the 2000s and to around 25% in the 2010s, according to Diederich. He said a more “dramatic” pull-out happened in 2022, when Advocate did not renew the lease on a large space on Rush Copley’s campus that it held for 13 years then started pulling its doctors from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between mid-2022 and early 2023, 90% of Advocate specialists resigned from Rush Copley’s medical staff, Diederich said. That included Advocate ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons, GI doctors and OB-GYNs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Advocate doctors remain, including cardiologists, nephrologists and hospitalists, but they only make up around 5% of the hospital’s patient care revenue at this point, Diederich said in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Advocate Health Care’s pullout of Rush Copley was a hit to the hospital’s revenues, which Diederich called a “short-term bump,” Rush Copley has been able to recover, both filling in the gaps that Advocate left behind with its own medical group and expanding that medical group to keep up with the community’s growth, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think Advocate’s short-term strategy was our long-term opportunity,” Diederich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s spokesperson said that, despite Advocate pulling its doctors out, the hospital has no gaps in care or coverage and remains “deeply committed to our mission of providing compassionate, accessible and community-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prime Healthcare has successfully transitioned services in the past, and we will continue to do so with the same level of diligence and dedication,” the spokesperson said. “Our patients deserve nothing less.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3012001b3b73llcxj7kr@published"&gt;My husband, “Mason,” and I have a 6-year-old daughter, “Evelyn,” who is the joy of our lives. She is an only child and we are satisfied with keeping it that way. The problem is my mother-in-law, “Clara.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="175" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na304r001c3b73fy23y7u2@published"&gt;For the past few years, Clara has insisted that Evelyn needs a sibling so she doesn’t grow up “spoiled and lonely.” She is convinced Evelyn will be “socially deprived” without the experience of having a sibling. But Evelyn is none of those things. Mason and I have clear boundaries and expectations for our daughter, and she has many friends at school and in her martial arts class; she is a happy, well-adjusted child. The other day, when she was at a friend’s for a play date, her friend’s 3-year-old brother ran up and kicked over a tower of blocks Evelyn and her friend had been stacking. After we got home, Evelyn told me she was glad not to have a younger brother or sister. So it’s not as if she’s feeling deprived! Clara, however, cannot seem to accept the fact that Evelyn is going to remain an only child. All our assurances that she and we are fine with things as they are fall on deaf ears. How can I get her to butt out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30dl001f3b73jmxu6ikc@published"&gt;For starters, instead of continuing to assure her that you, her son, and her grandchild are happy as you all are (which she either doesn’t believe or thinks is irrelevant), it’s time to address the overarching issue: her feeling entitled to offer this unasked-for advice—and not just once, but again and again. Tell her directly—or, better yet, ask her son to tell her directly—that this isn’t something that’s open for discussion with her. You’ve let this go on for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. It’s time to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30g6001g3b73k0k7u7q5@published"&gt;I feel honor bound to point out that telling her directly to butt out probably won’t work. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. It’s important to communicate clearly with the people in our lives; it’s important to set boundaries with them, too. While you can’t actually “get” her to lay off, you can—and should—refuse to engage if (when) she continues to offer her two cents (on this and any other off-limits topic). Raise an eyebrow, sigh loudly, say, “We talked about this, remember?” or just blithely change the subject. You can end the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30l3001h3b73l24kidf7@published"&gt;I have to ask (it’s my job to ask) if there’s any chance that she’s hitting a nerve with her constant criticism (because that is what this amounts to). Often when someone gets under our skin this way, it’s at least partly because they’re poking at a sensitive spot. &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; you have any nagging doubts you’re suppressing? I think it’s worth asking yourself this question for your own sake, entirely separate from your buttinsky mother-in-law problem. (For the record, I am a big fan of only children and the parents who have them.) As to that buttinsky mother-in-law herself, perhaps it will help to remind yourself that you don’t know what her motivation is. Is she really worried about Evelyn? (Maybe. But that’s her problem, not yours.) Does she simply want more grandchildren? (Again, not your problem.) Is she just the sort of person who believes she always knows best? (I could keep going, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001q3b73urdpa5dh@published"&gt;My family and I live down the block from my sister and her family. They went away for spring break to visit her in-laws and tasked my 12-year-old daughter “Blair” with feeding their tropical fish while they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001r3b73wljlyqpt@published"&gt;The day before they were due back, Blair went over in the morning to feed the fish and discovered they were all dead. It turned out that the tank heater had failed at some point during the previous day after Blair took care of them. The problem is that my sister is blaming Blair for “killing” her fish and demanding that we pay for new ones. Blair feels terrible about what happened, but she did a temperature check of the water before she left on the last day they were alive, and the temperature was where it was supposed to be (she had been writing it down on the daily temperature log, so we know for sure), so there was no negligence on her part. I explained this to my sister, but she won’t budge.  Now she says Blair and her cousins (with whom she is very close) can’t play together until we pay for new fish. My husband thinks this is outrageous, and I agree. Even so, would buying some new fish be worth it so we can put this in the rearview mirror for Blair’s sake?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpc001u3b73pb9foxhs@published"&gt;Are you sure this is about the fish? What’s your relationship with your sister like, anyway? It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; outrageous for her to demand that you pay to replace the fish that died because of her faulty heater. (Has Blair talked to her herself? Does she think Blair is lying? Or are you the one doing all the talking, relaying to your sister what Blair has told you—and does she think &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are lying? Do you and your sister have a long history of anger and bitterness between you? Or does your sister have a history of lashing out and blaming others for her misfortunes?)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpc001v3b73jvslvlfo@published"&gt;Whatever is behind this, you need to have a conversation. Giving in to your sister’s blackmail, replacing the fish “for Blair’s sake,” so that she will be allowed to play with her cousins, will put only this very specific situation in the rearview mirror—it will not solve the underlying problem. If that problem cannot be solved (or if you don’t care enough to want to solve it; if your relationship with your sister has always been rocky and you’re fine with keeping the status quo), but you don’t want the kids to suffer for it, I would go ahead and pay for the fish if you can afford it, simply to keep the peace. But I would have a frank talk with Blair about why you’re doing this. Otherwise, it will be very confusing to her, as it suggests that you do consider her at fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001w3b73wexgsgit@published"&gt;And if the matter is “resolved” in this way, I would definitely not have her be “tasked” with any house- or pet-sitting or other duties for her aunt in the future. Give her permission to politely decline such requests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001x3b73xzhwijdw@published"&gt;But oh how I hope—optimist that I am—that you and your sister can have a healthy, honest, authentic conversation that provides insight for both of you into the real reasons for this conflict, and that your relationship going forward is itself healthier, more honest, and more authentic. It is what I wish for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soa00263b73oow3ngq9@published"&gt;My granddaughter, “Carmen,” is very bright and bubbly most of the time. A few years ago, a freak accident triggered a chronic illness. She can walk, usually with a cane, but for long distances she usually makes use of a wheelchair. She has been complaining to me lately about how her parents baby her. For example, if her brothers want to take part in a family activity in an area of the city that isn’t wheelchair-accessible, her parents will dismiss the idea “for Carmen’s sake,” even though Carmen herself feels perfectly capable of walking for the distance required.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9nbus0600043b74ab68huyz@published"&gt;It’d be one thing if she were 5 or 6 years old, but Carmen is 10, and a 10-year-old who has grown up very quickly. Perhaps because of the months she has spent in and out of the hospital, she is more mature than many other kids her age. I personally trust Carmen’s ability to judge her own abilities. I also understand that Carmen’s parents are scared. But their overprotectiveness is not doing Carmen any favors. I’m not sure how best to broach the conversation with my son and daughter-in-law. They have both been very defensive in the past about the way they handled Carmen’s hospitalization and illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe00293b73sn3zwq2b@published"&gt;Don’t broach the conversation at all. I promise you: Your advice on this matter will not be welcome. If you were paying attention, you might have learned this lesson when they were “defensive” about the way they “handled” Carmen’s illness and hospitalization years ago. Think of it this way: They should not have to defend their parenting to their child’s grandmother. The child’s grandmother should be keeping her own counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe002a3b739qg6duak@published"&gt;What you can do, of course, is be supportive of Carmen. When she comes to you complaining about her parents, you can be sympathetic (“That must be frustrating for you!”), you can encourage her to find ways to let her parents know that she may be able to handle more than they think she can, and you can do things with her yourself that provide her more opportunities to challenge herself. But the bottom line here is that no matter what a grandparent thinks the right way to be a parent to their grandchild is—short of knowledge of abuse, of course—it’s not their place to say so.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A 10-year-old girl who'll keep going to the local clinic for the medications to suppress the HIV virus — forgetting that it's now closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A house painter who no longer has the strength to do his work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A teenager who finds comfort in religious music as she wonders why it was her fate to be born HIV positive — and how she will find the medications she needs to keep the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are three of the dozens of HIV positive people in Zambia we interviewed during a trip there this month to see what the impact has been of the Trump Administration's suspension and termination of billions of dollars in global health programs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Administration officials maintain that certain life saving aid — like HIV medications — has been spared. But people on the ground tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the Zambian government for comment on the impact of the cuts and to the U.S. State Department as well. Neither responded to our inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR spoke with dozens of HIV-positive people in Zambia to learn the impact on them. They consistently report chaos and confusion — and, increasingly, people falling ill without their HIV medication. Here are some of their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Dorcas and Theresa Mwanza: 'She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                After eight days without taking HIV medications, Dorcas Mwanza, 10, developed a fever and chills, among the first symptoms people experience when they go off HIV treatment.

   &lt;p&gt;"Jovial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the word Theresa Mwanza, 32, liked to use to describe her 10-year-old daughter, Dorcas. When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When NPR met with the family in early April, it had been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                After the USAID clinic closed, Theresa Mwanza, left, tried to get HIV medications for herself and her daughter, Dorcas, at a government run clinic but was turned away.

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"She'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59948" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off. Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59788" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Before medication became available for free with help with the U.S., Theresa Mwanza's two sisters died of AIDS.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Mary Mayongana: 'What will become of me?'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. "All of us live here as one big family," Mary says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59881" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.
                &lt;b class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
                    
                    Ben de la Cruz/NPR

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Ben de la Cruz/NPR
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;
            
&lt;div class="credit-caption"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-wrap"&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption" aria-label="Image caption"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                "I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary, who for more than two months, hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication.
                &lt;b class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

                &lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak," he says as his voice cracks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-61289" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Holy Spirit come,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Come and have your way"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lately Catherine's question of "why" has been superseded by the question of "how." How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even if I go there, they [will] say, we should buy medicines. And actually, I'm a school girl and I don't have money. And [my grandmother] just sells some tomatoes so that she can earn money to provide for the food," Catherine says, in a low, flat voice as a tear traces its way down her cheek. "I've heard that there are many millions of people going to die."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

However, too many of these fit-friendly meals can sometimes lead to long-lasting effects, ones that could even be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil nuts, hailed for its wealth of antioxidants, essential minerals and nutrients are advised by nutritionists as an important addition to the diet. The star nutrient of the nutrient-dense seeds from the Brazil nut tree is selenium, the mineral that fights inflammation, protects cells from oxidative stress, supports immune function, and is good for thyroid health. Additionally, Brazil nuts also have magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, Thiamine (Vitamin B1), Vitamin E, healthy fats, protein, and fibre. The nutrient-dense superfood is known to lower cholesterol and guard heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many amazing benefits, it's easier to snack on it way too much than necessary. Eating more Brazil nuts means an increased intake of selenium too, a compound with protective properties in limited amounts, but a potential damaging effect in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily intake of selenium is 55 micrograms (mcg) per day, but it may go slightly up for pregnant women (60 mcg) per day and breastfeeding women (70 mcg) per day, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) – Office of Dietary Supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what happens when you exceed this daily limit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other vitamins and minerals, excess of selenium over a long period of time could lead to selenium toxicity. Also known as selenosis, the condition may lead to garlicky odor in the breath, a metallic taste in the mouth and symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea, tiredness, irritability, and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other signs include loss of mentation (mental activity) , tingling or numbness, hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes), brittle or deformed nails, alopecia (hair loss), discoloration and loss of teeth, as well as skin rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute toxicity can lead to heart attack, kidney failure, vascular symptoms such as tachycardia (faster heart rate than normal) and flushing of the face, tremors, irritability, and myalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can too much of selenium lead to cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While selenium is known to protect against cancer, having excess amounts can do the opposite - it can raise risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6491296/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; called Selenium for Preventing Cancer analysed data from 10 studies involving over 27,000 people. It was found there was no evidence that selenium supplements decrease cancer incidence. In fact, it raised the risk of prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in people taking a selenium supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The correct way to eat Brazil nuts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit your intake to 1-2 nuts per day. This amount is enough to meet your daily selenium requirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add 1 nut into a morning smoothie for a creamy texture and a selenium boost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chop and sprinkle on salads or yogurt. Combine 1–2 Brazil nuts with other nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium and Vitamin E work synergistically to fight oxidative stress. Add Brazil nuts to a spinach or avocado recipe for maximum benefits. &lt;p data-type="video" data-msid="115669038" data-hostid="83" data-title="How Lifestyle Choices Can Increase Your Risk of Stomach Cancer" data-thumburl="https://denmark.timesinternet.in/cmslite/api/app/images.jpg?msid=115669038&amp;amp;hostid=83"&gt;&lt;msid&gt;115669038&lt;/msid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxNei1Sdld4M2p6VW1sM1l6djhQZm1nX2FqRUEzUnFOWHVlSWVQMlBqUjNtWGE1LUdmdExkZU5NTWxrckk4ZlRRaEdEbGViQm80SnVwaEtOSEFWRnlZZFp3ZkNwRUdlbWJWc0JlLTNkOE91T2dqdHMzRmpxQzM2aUctUkFWZ2QwWTZSTmk2aGUteDlISmNsc0hlS093NllvY1RiS1FSOEUxc2N2Z05SeHRscHl1b2tEak9aMzZodUhCUHR4WGRaWWFRMEtOQ0xLbEJaUi1iVzJrX19BNGE0dG1BNW50YjBGT1dGNGc0NjhaQ2RweWJ3NXgyeG9pb2w</guid></item><item><title>研究人员在发现日常产品中存在“隐形”威胁后发出紧急警告： “要求我们立即采取行动” -雅虎 | Researchers issue urgent warning after discovering 'invisible' threat in everyday products: 'Requires us to act now' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQRTVSUDNTaldCUlk5Y0NhVXhaUjd2MnY2YmluT0JTV3YyQ2NvLUFDNndaX0NIb0hpanNIRDI5OEFwNmlTRGM1QXp0eG05N3gtS3V0UXRSQ00wbHNNSG1PVTQ0VDBNUG1LVDFmVDdVUTItWkZXb1pTd1FTbG00RXZvRmljS2VZaDZCc05Zalpxbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The health risks associated with microplastics have been known for years. However, researchers are now learning that it doesn't take much for microplastic particles to make their way into our food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A growing number of scientists have noted that microplastics have the ability to easily shed into food and water without much effort. While many people might assume that overuse is the main concern in microplastic exposure, the truth is that these microscopic plastic particles may end up in your food after just one use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Victoria Fulfer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island, said the prevalence of plastic use in food packaging only amplifies the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Mostly, when a container says 'microwave safe,' it means it's safe for the container to be in the microwave, it's not going to melt," Fulfer &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"But that doesn't mean that it's safe for you as a person, because microwaving plastic particularly changes the chemical bonds," Fulfer added. "They make them more weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is microplastic exposure important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the Grossman Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University, explained that microplastic exposure can lead to an array of severe health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're talking about cardiovascular mortality," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News. "We're also talking about hormone-sensitive cancers. Breast, thyroid, ovarian, not to mention kidney cancer, that have been associated with these chemical exposures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasing health risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increasing health risk&lt;/a&gt; that comes along with microplastic exposure, scientists note that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151227/#:~:text=In%20vitro%20experiments%20with%20human,gut%20microbiota%20dysbiosis%2C%20and%20neurotoxicity." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; needs to be done to determine the extent of the possible damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about reducing microplastic use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Trasande, there are ways that we may be able to address this growing concern. "Preventing plastic exposure is very much possible," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researcher suggested that by including color-based additives to chemicals in plastic creation, we can help visualize the abundance of plastic in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Looking to the next ten years ahead, biomonitoring initiatives are needed to visualise this issue, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries," Trasande added. "The technology to measure [micro- and nanoplastics] will eventually advance and make concerns even more apparent, but the threat of the invisible requires us to act now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, legislators have worked to progress measures to minimize the production of single-use plastics. In 2023, Senator Jeff Merkley introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3127/text" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to "prevent pollution from consumer products and packaging from entering into animal and human food chains and waterways, and for other purposes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, 170 countries pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47592111" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significantly reduce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significantly reduce&lt;/a&gt; the use of plastics by 2030.

And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. &lt;/span&gt;HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brandon Tessers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://effectiveartistry.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “&lt;span&gt;feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Vanessa Bal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in New Jersey said folks describe it as “a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “&lt;span&gt;The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;able. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;When a routine is disrupted, strong emotions may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If &lt;span&gt;they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude &lt;span&gt;to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result&lt;s&gt;s&lt;/s&gt; in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “T&lt;span&gt;hey’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jordan Siemens via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jordan Siemens via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's not uncommon for an adult with autism to need time alone after days filled with social commitments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular &lt;span&gt;activity&lt;/span&gt; or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and dogs,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “W&lt;span&gt;hat we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" #actuallyautistic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt; #actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="embrace-autism.com" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://embrace-autism.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer than 10% of U.S. adults get the 28 to 34 grams of fiber we need each day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal is a great start, but there are fruits with even more fiber than oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include avocados, blackberries, raspberries, pears and pomegranates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almost all of us could use more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. Even though we’re supposed to consume 28 to 34 grams of fiber a day, fewer than 1 in 10 of us actually do it (yikes!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just spell trouble for our digestive health. Fiber also helps protect against weight gain and can help reduce the risk of a long list of chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, whole grains like oatmeal can help. For instance, a half-cup of dry oats provides 4 grams of fiber. But did you know that some fruits contain even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fiber than a bowl of oatmeal?&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, fruit is jammed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you’re wondering how much fruit you should eat, the USDA recommends roughly 2 cups per day for women and 2½ cups for men (if you’re a fan of dried fruit, ½ cup of dried fruit equals 1 cup of fresh).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, keep eating that oatmeal. But load your shopping cart with these fiber-rich fruits, too!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-avocados"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Avocados &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 avocado = 10 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; as a vegetable, but they’re actually a fruit. Green silky avocados are so versatile and delicious that you can use them in almost all kinds of recipes, from salads to smoothies to guacamole and more. No wonder they’re so popular! Between 2000 and 2020, global avocado consumption tripled from 6 billion pounds to 18 billion pounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthwise, avocados may be best known for their heart-friendly fats. But their fiber may be equally as important for your health, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, research reveals avocados’ fiber may encourage the growth of good gut bacteria. This, in turn, may lead to the production of compounds called short-chain fatty acids that nourish your gut and protect it from inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-blackberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Blackberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup =  8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All berries are loaded with fiber, but blackberries are off the charts. That’s not the only reason to love them, though. Blackberries are also chock-full of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, including antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagitannins, flavonols and flavanols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These powerful compounds help disable disease-causing free radicals linked to illnesses like heart disease and cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, blackberries’ ample vitamin C (roughly a third of your daily requirement per cup) provides even more antioxidant action. Blackberries’ vitamin C also happens to enhance iron absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  So, adding a giant handful of blackberries to your oatmeal can help you soak up more of its iron and give you a fiber bump in the process. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-raspberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Raspberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup = 8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like blackberries,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; raspberries&lt;/a&gt; are among the highest-fiber fruits. They’re also loaded with protective anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and ellagitannins. Combined, these may have potent disease-preventing properties. Consider the findings of one study that focused on the impact of raspberry consumption on diabetes and prediabetes. Researchers concluded that eating 1 to 1½ cups of raspberries daily may have beneficial effects on blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol in people at risk for chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-pears"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Pears &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 medium pear = 6 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples may be a quick, convenient, grab-on-the-go fruit. But don’t forget about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292095/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-pears/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pears&lt;/a&gt;. One pear delivers roughly 20% of the Daily Value for fiber. That’s 30% more than the roughly 4 grams of fiber in the average apple.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  And if constipation is an issue, pears can provide a natural solution. These sweet, juicy fruits are rich in sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that has a natural laxative effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup pomegranate = 7 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These juicy, ruby-red fruits may resemble apples from the outside, but they’re actually giant berries. While their thick, inedible skin is a no-go, their fleshy arils (which are botanically considered a whole grain, by the way) are packed with fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Like their berry cousins, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pomegranates&lt;/a&gt; are nutrition powerhouses. They’re rich in phytochemicals, including anthocyanins, tannins and flavonoids, which have been shown to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties and protect against heart disease. Research also reveals pomegranates contain compounds called polyphenols that help promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, so they’re a win for gut health, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As healthy and tasty as pomegranates are, peeling them can be tricky! But don’t let that stop you. This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-prep-and-eat-a-pomegranate-8719579" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; tells you everything you need to know for pomegranate peeling success,  photos included!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Top-Rated High-Fiber Fruit Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber has many health benefits, from keeping you full and satisfied to stabilizing blood sugar levels to lowering cholesterol and more. Of course, whole grains like oatmeal are a great way to score more of this under-consumed nutrient. However, some fruits contain even more fiber than a bowl of oatmeal, especially avocados, blackberries, raspberries and pomegranates. So, head to the produce section and load up. And if you can’t find your favorite fruits in season, don’t forget the freezer section, where you’ll find almost all of the fruits on this list, even avocados!

    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reason for these changes is that, as people get closer to the age that “old” starts, they want to keep pushing it down the road? “True, but being ‘old’ isn’t only to do with how many years you’ve been alive, it also depends on your health,” he says. “If you’ve had a stroke or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/gardened-my-way-through-grief-then-cancer-struck/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, or have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or are otherwise immobile, you will feel older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough thinks that old age is “often a case of self-definition. At 82, I would define myself as old,” he says. “Maybe I became old when we moved to a retirement village seven years ago, or when I was diagnosed with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/prostate-cancer-what-you-should-know/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” And yet he hasn’t said goodbye to youth without a struggle. “If someone tells me I look younger  as happened at the barber’s the other day – I’m still flattered, despite the fact my age gets me a cheaper haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then I ask myself: why should I get pleasure at being told I look younger? Why don’t we look at older people as beautiful, as we do with trees? Look at my wizened old hands here, and compare them with the bark of a tree. Why is one beautiful, and not the other?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning to manage frailty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough looks after himself: on a swift walk around the Peaks near his home, he leaves this writer panting to keep up. “I do this walk four times a week, go to the gym, and I play tennis when my back allows, though my children are always begging me not to go for the tricky drop shots,” he says. “But I recognise that I am not what I was. If you ask someone my age ‘how are you?’ you know you are going to get a long response.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, he agrees, humour in the sound of a bunch of older people sitting around discussing their ailments and medications. “But it’s also quite interesting,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps old age begins when, if we take a tumble, we go from the action being termed “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/how-to-fall-over-safely/"&gt;having a fall&lt;/a&gt;”, rather than merely “falling over”, which is what young people do. “Yes, there is definitely a difference here,” he says. “‘Having a fall’ feels like something is being done to you; I am out of control of my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know I am frail,” he continues. “I’m vulnerable and not as stable as I used to be. I know that when I’m out walking I need, as Ann keeps reminding me, to ‘keep away from the edge’. I’m learning to take more care, because one false step could immobilise me. I’m trying to keep a foothold; it’s a bit of an analogy for my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to try the Three Peaks Challenge again. “But I will be kind to myself if I don’t complete it,” he adds. “I’d love to go over old ground, but if it’s not to be, it’s not to be. I wouldn’t be a failure. I won’t berate myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accept your memory is failing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However much we want to stress the ability and wisdom of older people, there is a hinterland of diminishing competence,” says Clough. He tells a story of trying to make himself a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-black-coffee/"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, filling the cafetière with boiling water, but omitting the granules. “I’m sitting there with a cup of hot water, thinking: do I tell Ann?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough then relates a recent incident where he was having trouble reversing his car in a tight spot, and was happy for his son to take over. He compares this with earlier competence, driving his family in a rickety truck in Namibia. “I’m now aware of my uncertainty, after a lifetime beavering away over decision-making,” he says. “These days I want my children to decide things for me (at least, I think I do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I have learnt is that I have to accept this is how it is,” he continues. He and his friends laugh about their loss of executive function: “But &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/health-benefits-laughter/"&gt;the laughter&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain because it could be early stage dementia. Laughter is a way of dealing with anxiety and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning from his father’s old age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last few years of his life, Clough’s father went to live in a care home. “In the home, he became very secluded,” Clough remembers. “Dad was a Methodist minister, he was used to holding court. He would just about go down to meals, but I was surprised about how much he stayed in his room: he never went into the garden, or onto walks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Clough tried to encourage his father out of his shell, but then he changed his mind. “Maybe we are imposing a pattern on older people that isn’t naturally there,” he says. “I gradually realised my father was finding a way to come to terms with himself. By this stage, he has already been living without my mother for 14 or 15 years. After he died, I found notes in his bible, about his favourite hymns, TV programmes and articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my father wanted to use these final months to talk to himself and reflect – to know what was important to him, not other people – and to move towards it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Are we trying too hard to stay ‘young’? Maybe it’s time for acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a strong move in society to almost think we can get away without ageing as long as we eat the right food, take the right supplements, go to the gym, and just keep going,” says Clough. He sees this as a new kind of ageism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t accept a stage of life where our body is going to be different,” he says. “You think this gung-ho lifestyle will keep you going, but what happens when you have a heart attack? It’s really important how you come to terms with this life-stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead, you can make the decision to use this time to ‘come home’, to live and let go, and to know you aren’t going to be around forever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough feels the writing of &lt;em&gt;Oldenland &lt;/em&gt;has helped prepare him to carve out and create the last period of his life. “Ageing is an important time of life for living, not necessarily ‘doing’ or ‘accomplishing’ or going around the world,” he says. “It’s not about ‘success’. It’s a time to live to the full with who and what I am, alongside the realisation I am not going to go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old age isn’t just about problems with your bladder or your bowels or your hearing – it can be a time to really &lt;em&gt;live.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oldenland: A Journey in Search of the Good Last Years&lt;/em&gt; by Roger Clough is published on 24 April 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There has been so much controversy on the use of GLP-1 medication to aid in shedding those pounds, and this is not the first time that warnings have come out about using the drug for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; has been furthering a lot of people's weight loss results, even thought it was originally created to help manage Type 2 Diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One of the main reasons Ozempic has become such a big deal in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; sector is the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity"&gt;famous celebs&lt;/a&gt; who have been taking it and revealing their slimmer bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-thin-people-comment-479544-20250123"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;, Sharon Osbourne, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/amy-schumer-mounjaro-funny-video-211223-20250413"&gt;Amy Schumer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/rebel-wilson-ozempic-weight-loss-memoir-656231-20240401"&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; have all admitted to using a GLP-1 drug, be it to lose or maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The grim reality of Ozempic has been posted (YouTube/@zackdfilms)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, as Ozempic hasn't been approved by the FDA for weight loss, it could be a risk to take it for any other use other than its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Semaglutide, which can help to regulate your appetite, however, is approved for weight loss under the Wegovy brand name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While we’ve all seen the results about how the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/drugs"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; works, many still don’t know how it actually helps people to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Thankfully, a YouTuber by the handle @ZackDFilms has come to the rescue and revealed the grim realities of what Ozempic does once it hits your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the clip, you can see everything that happens, from how it changes your brain, to the inner workings of your organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Plus, it also shows some pesky side effects which might make you feel a little icky afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He states: “Once Ozempic is in your bloodstream, it activates the part of the brain that make you feel full, reducing your appetite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;From there, it’ll stabilize ‘your blood sugar’ to curb those nagging food cravings you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, this all sounds great, and while he also shares that it stops your stomach from emptying as fast so that you feel fuller for longer, this part of the drug symptom could then in turn make you feel sick and even produce diarrhea in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;People who watched the video were equally horrified and interested in how Ozempic could do this to your body, reducing weight and supressing hunger in users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, there are more side effects that could present themselves for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Ben Bickman, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/science"&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt; and professor at Brigham Young University in Utah, stated that even muscle loss can be brought on after using the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"You have a substantial amount of lean mass that's getting loss as the person is losing weight. To make that clear, for every ten pounds of weight loss, only six is fat - four of it is coming from non-fat sources like muscle and bone," he told Thomas DeLauer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Bickman added: "While muscle and bone mass might never return, the body has no trouble regaining fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What's more, one study found that one version of these drugs, actually stimulates the production of new fat cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He continued: "This becomes a problem because when a person start to regain fat mass after stopping Ozempic, with more fat cells comes a greater potential to gain more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"As a result, even though a person may still weight less than they did before starting the drug, they may be fatter, with a higher percentage of body fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:52:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNSm1FWDhBcER2TlNON2E4SkpBdUJ2MGRKbFIwNm9RcVVGOE9kbGVpZmpLUjFZS2NQVXVUVHpoanFFQ1Q4WVR2Z0JwbFpfdks4bEpxV3ZTWHRJNWFQYVY1NnRUWHJBQmRwTGg0d0t1MmI0Ujk3RHgzYXg0Y3JDT2FHMzhFX21IV1JOaURwcjhEMzRIZzZUdXc</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了男性每月应射精多少次以帮助预防前列腺癌- UNILAD | Study reveals how many times a man should ejaculate per month to help prevent prostate cancer - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNWHA4N3NMamFzUXpjd1VDMl9tTV96RnVTSGRrMjhKRzJ4Q0lXOWVyZEJLeG5RSmNpMERBOUQ4SWl3Q2tYRHJsaFJ6V21TN2gtTXM3c3JYZDl6ZjlNeTVjYkNYWUgzeGRPZV9VRENaaHJManNKbEdhdmdEOTBjeU1VdW52cjI0OE5TNkRoeERFM2pnY0ZJWjFQUUtPa3BIb25D?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study looking into a link between orgasms and the development of prostate cancer has revealed how many times a man should ejaculate per month to prevent the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The American Cancer Society states that one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;

The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough infections.&lt;/a&gt; People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/80/3/663/7756619" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunctivitis, or red eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/a&gt;The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s still the question of why these infections happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;the vaccine wanes very quickly.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers&lt;/a&gt; published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184979/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927136/" target="_blank"&gt;lose their protection &lt;/a&gt;over the course of two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;long-term vaccine protection&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;When you might need a measles booster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPeGpRZnY2Zjd4ZWJKLXR1dHJSbnVWTEp2UVptNE1zYWIxQkotR3ZPcURVbFRMd3o1dVF0RXN3emM4YnRpVWtDSXE0YmZMWm9wQTlqREhjU0pXZUVaTkg1T0Fyb1RmbVB0ZHh2a0JsY1pjRFJ3TEFBcXpYdEtsLV9GUG5wUU5MbWlEbnZPZjRmWlFxQlFQTjlvVmtqQzkzN3A1V2JYdmR2c3dvMV9PcHfSAVZBVV95cUxPSlVhS0o2MHNsQzJnMllKMWZoeVJuT1cwVy1kWEwxU241VW1vZ01vbFpqWjRDQkxSQlo3Z3l3b3JPV2lpRV96T1hQX3RqOEd0dTBoTllkdw</guid></item><item><title>根据最新研究-食品和葡萄酒，为什么你应该多吃生姜 | Why You Should Be Eating More Ginger, According to New Research - Food &amp; Wine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9CdU41ckZwTmt4aC1rSF9wcW1Bb08yWm5PbFcxYXNVUFcwdlRITUQ3QmFDOWY3YUl1ZmRyT3g2bE10LTFLdEJ4MmN4ZlZiZGw1ek1WaldIR1Y3Tm9leXNrTE9jUU9pNWlZSy1RNlFyWHV0U19XQ3RLdUVHckg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study published in medical journal &lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt; reveals numerous health benefits ginger can provide, including its ability to lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The many health benefits of ginger led researchers to conclude that the ingredient is a viable tool for assisting in treatment of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ginger can also aid in digestion, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger is a welcome addition to many recipes. It’s aromatic, spicy, and carries a hint of earthy, citrusy flavor. But aside from its zesty taste, recent research published in medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/335712-ginger-a-nutraceutical-supplement-for-protection-against-various-cardiovascular-diseases-in-clinical-trials#!/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the flowering spice is a natural way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2025 study analyzed the potential health benefits of ginger in cardiology, with a focus on how it can impact diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Beyond this, the review also investigated the health benefits of gingerol and shogaol, two phytochemicals — naturally occurring chemicals in plants — found in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cooking-with-ginger-8625087" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; that are responsible for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the report, ginger contains numerous bioactive compounds that decrease inflammation, lower blood pressure, enhance vascular health, and improve lipid profiles.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together the many health benefits of ginger led scientists to conclude that “due to the biological functions and cardioprotective properties of ginger and its constituents, it may serve as a new therapeutic agent for various CVDs (cardiovascular diseases).” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also confirmed that ginger has few adverse effects, deeming the superfood a worthwhile nutraceutical as it provides health benefits beyond basic nutrition, helping to prevent or manage disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting characteristics, primarily due to its phenolic compounds, gingerol and shogaol, says &lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/naidu-srihari-s.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Srihari Naidu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at New York Medical College.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As &lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/departments/internal-medicine/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy&lt;/a&gt;, MD, the chair of internal medicine at the Burnett School of Medicine at Texas Christian University explains, shogaol is derived from gingerol, and other &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/14/6/571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest it carries many of the same health perks as this compound, but it’s also known to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which are key markers for a stable cardiovascular system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additional research in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11352747/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomolecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ginger favorably affects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422013770" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hallmarks of aging&lt;/a&gt; at a cellular level. This is likely because ginger is a natural antioxidant, which can help neutralize free radicals that cause premature aging. However, Naidu says more research is needed to determine ginger’s exact effects on longevity and aging.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger has anti-inflammatory effects which help lower inflammation throughout the body, and decreased inflammation of the blood vessels helps improve blood pressure regulation and prevents plaque buildup in your arteries,” says &lt;a href="https://chicagoheartvascular.com/about/rohit-vuppuluri-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rohit Vuppuluri&lt;/a&gt;, DO, an interventional and vascular cardiologist at Chicago Heart and Vascular Specialists.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular ginger consumption can significantly reduce triglyceride and LDL cholesterol (often known as “bad” cholesterol), while increasing HDL (or “good”) cholesterol, says Sathyamoorthy. This is especially beneficial for heart health as high levels of LDL cholesterol are &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2932233-9/fulltext" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, he explains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most research on the benefits of ginger involves daily consumption of anywhere from 500 milligrams to two grams, according to Naidu. “I would recommend staying within the lower dose, or around 500 milligrams a day, as higher doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects — such as abdominal discomfort and gas — and possibly increase bleeding risk, especially for those on blood thinners,” he says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some people report heartburn or stomach upset with ginger intake, so those with ulcers should avoid regular consumption in any dose unless cleared by a doctor, says Naidu.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to the type of ginger, Vuppuluri recommends the raw ingredient because it’s the most potent, leading to maximum antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pickled ginger, as seen at Japanese sushi restaurants, is another great, less bitter option. Ginger tea and ginger powder are other accessible ways to incorporate the spice into your routine, though Naidu says more research is needed on the efficacy of both compared to its raw, unprocessed form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, keeping ginger consumption consistent is the most important factor for those seeking to take advantage of its benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Naidu also cautions consumers to be careful with ginger supplements, because they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. If you prefer a supplement, your doctor can guide you on the best option, but one helpful tip is to seek out a product that has been third-party tested (for example, NSF-, USP-, or GMP-certified). This means an unbiased party has tested the product and confirmed it only contains the ingredients listed on the label and in the amounts stated. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from supporting cardiovascular health, ginger is a digestion superstar. Gingerol is found to &lt;a href="https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-023-04227-x" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulate the gut&lt;/a&gt; and improve gastrointestinal mobility, which means it helps food move efficiently through the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, thanks to ginger’s ability to increase digestive responsiveness and speed up stomach emptying, it may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267223015265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calm nausea&lt;/a&gt; from motion sickness, pregnancy, and chemotherapy, per Naidu.
&lt;/p&gt;

The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breakthrough infections.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;breakthrough infections.&lt;/a&gt; People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/80/3/663/7756619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Conjunctivitis, or red eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas Department of State Health Services.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/a&gt;The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s still the question of why these infections happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview with CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the vaccine wanes very quickly.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the vaccine wanes very quickly.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers&lt;/a&gt; published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184979/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccinated against measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927136/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lose their protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lose their protection &lt;/a&gt;over the course of two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term vaccine protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long-term vaccine protection&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;When you might need a measles booster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-breakthrough-infections-causes-vaccine-symptoms-rcna201799" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPdjFLR1N1VVhlRFc2eFBhS1k5bnR4MmpMVGItdjE0SVlHa0xDOFlCMUx1aGdMTVFFRkFPck9rVGVIbGZfaDNybnZTSkhsNFpUZHNoNkYwZlZBcjVZN1M4UFNwYUcwT19qTS1UM2tibUpjR0NZUmpBSmFXRXVMYmJzZTNOX3k4bEk</guid></item><item><title>今天的杂草非常强大。但这不是你应该担心的。-石板 | Today’s Weed Is Incredibly Strong.

You reach that tipping point where your high turns from mellow to paranoid, and all of a sudden you’re stumbling uncontrollably down a rabbit hole of terrifying thoughts which all lead to the conclusion that the world is ending. Nobody likes how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001j3b73exvzte9m@published"&gt;Ever since recreational cannabis became legal, the risks of overconsuming have raised debates about potency. (Remember Maureen Dowd’s 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27704837"&gt;hotel room freak-out&lt;/a&gt;?) That panic has returned with force in recent months, as cannabis has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4977448/americans-report-using-marijuana-more-frequently-than-alcohol-what-are-the-risks-of-both"&gt;become more popular than ever&lt;/a&gt;, and dispensaries are advertising ever more potent products. Earlier this year, the New York Times blasted the cannabis industry for fighting bills that limit potency. Such laws have been proposed around the country, including in &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A977#:~:text=2025%2DA977%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,other%20cannabis%20or%20hemp%20products."&gt;New York &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_076_01.pdf"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; (where it applies only to people under 25), and &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/438/BillText/c1/PDF"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and would put caps on THC flower potency between 0.3 and 15 percent. (Commercially available cannabis usually contains at least 20 percent THC.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001k3b73iqlpkb6l@published"&gt;The problem is that lawmakers and the media alike deeply misunderstand how cannabis potency actually works. Peter Grinspoon, a physician, Harvard Medical School instructor, and author of &lt;em&gt;Seeing Through the Smoke,&lt;/em&gt; on medical cannabis, told Slate that limits on the simple percentage of THC in cannabis products could actually hurt medical patients for a number of reasons. People adjust their doses based on the strength of a product—so if they’re smoking a product that’s half as strong, for example, they might end up smoking twice as much, doing further damage to their lungs. Studies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93198-5.epdf"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consumers will naturally use less when the product is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

And the argument is it’s so dangerous because it’s so potent.” On top of potential lung damage, Grinspoon says that weakening potency will simply make cannabis more expensive for medical patients, and “twice as expensive for people on fixed incomes, like veterans and older people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhj001m3b737jrr7j54@published"&gt;Existing and past laws limiting cannabis potency are misguided not just because they might actually lead people to consume more, but because they’re written in a way that fails to understand the complexity of cannabis potency, according to Brien Hoffhine, director of cultivation at Loudbird Cannabis in Boulder, Colorado. The misunderstanding originated with the 2018 Farm Bill, which stipulates that cannabis potency should be determined by the percentage of the cannabinoid delta 9 THC—the most well-known intoxicating component of cannabis—in a product.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001n3b73ne0kx08l@published"&gt;“They just had no idea how the science actually worked,” Hoffhine told Slate. What the lawmakers misunderstood is that THCA, which is often present in higher quantities than delta 9 THC and which does not influence legal potency levels in the Farm Bill, can convert to delta 9 THC when it’s smoked. On top of that, there are many other cannabinoids in the plant that can make a high more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001o3b73vdjvv6cv@published"&gt;Hoffhine admits that consumers gravitate toward high-THC products, and that influences what he grows and sells. He says that if the weekly menu that Loudbird puts out has products with THC levels below 20 percent, they won’t get any orders.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001p3b734gvo1iml@published"&gt;But the percentages listed on product labels and menus don’t tell the whole truth. THC potency is determined through mandatory lab testing. But, Hoffhine explained, labs can return dramatically different results for the same plant. It’s an open secret in the industry that brands will shop around labs to get the highest potency result, and multiple studies &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282396"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that potency labels on products are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10096267/#:~:text=%5B18%5D%20evaluated%2014%2C234%20samples%20of,retail%20(21.5%25%20%C2%B16.0)"&gt;usually inflated&lt;/a&gt;. So when the New York Times reports that a certain brand is selling the most potent weed around, they might inadvertently be promoting the brand’s dubious marketing claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001q3b73dc9ti4x1@published"&gt;Masha Ty, who works for ACS Laboratory, which tests cannabis products in Florida, told Slate that her lab has lost clients because they refused to inflate their THC numbers. “We don’t give them the high numbers that they want to see, so they leave,” Ty said. “It’s bad, right? But we’re under NDA. We can’t really call them out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001r3b730pbp2zx6@published"&gt;Ty emphasizes that, unlike alcohol, cannabis potency is influenced by multiple components, and varies quite a bit based on the individual consumer. There are at least 118 cannabinoids in the plant that go beyond the well-known THC and CBD, and they all interact with one another to produce different kinds of highs. Different individuals, too, have different endocannabinoid systems, which will affect their response to different products. Terpenes, which exist in all plants, can also contribute to the quality of the high. These compounds help “steer” the experience, Ty explained, because they can make it focused, relaxing, or uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001s3b737o0znfu8@published"&gt;Newer to the market are THC distillates and concentrates, which can contain up to 95 percent THC. These products are more potent in some ways, but they also provide a more one-dimensional experience, because they only contain THC.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001t3b73xbwk6esx@published"&gt;Grinspoon is concerned about how the market has gravitated toward high-THC cannabis. “I think we fetishize high THC, and we could do a lot better with lower THC,” he said, adding that CBD can mitigate some of the addictive qualities of cannabis, and other cannabinoids have more medical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001u3b7317yxrvmw@published"&gt;Grinspoon, Hoffhine, and Ty all agree that potency limits aren’t the answer, but they also find that the market focus on THC is misguided. To fix this, they want better research and education about all of the components of cannabis and how they affect different people differently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001v3b735l0ewtji@published"&gt;For example, if people understood the science behind cannabis edibles, they’d know why some people simply aren’t affected by them , no matter how potent they are. “Some people don’t even process it,” Ty explained. “So they eat gummies and nothing will happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001w3b73luqvyqxq@published"&gt;It’s just one example of how deeply complicated cannabis potency is. Until lawmakers learn to understand it, they have no hope of effectively regulating &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas – so far, so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanist &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/career-and-legacy" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Karl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; is legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave us &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/sounds/play/m001l291" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the classification system we still use today&lt;/a&gt;: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteria &lt;i id="escherichia-coli" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, or the lion, &lt;i id="panthera-leo" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i id="gorilla-gorilla" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Gorilla gorilla&lt;/i&gt;, which probably doesn't need explaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We are &lt;i id="homo-sapiens" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; – wise people. But in his foundational work &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/7/mode/1up" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="systemae-naturae" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Systemae Naturae&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Linnaeus introduced another &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;tier of classification for us&lt;/a&gt;, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses: &lt;i id="asiaticus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Asiaticus&lt;/i&gt; – people with "yellow skin", and straight black hair; &lt;i id="americanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Americanus&lt;/i&gt; – indigenous Americans, with "red skin" also with straight black hair; &lt;i id="africanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Africanus&lt;/i&gt; – "black skinned" people with tight curls in their hair; and &lt;i id="europeaus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Europeaus&lt;/i&gt; – "white skinned" with blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These designations are clearly absurd – none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use "black" and "white" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions of &lt;i id="systemae-naturae" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Systemae Naturae&lt;/i&gt;, which became the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;basis for scientific racism&lt;/a&gt;, were portrayals of behaviours. &lt;i id="asiaticus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Asiaticus&lt;/i&gt; were described as "haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions" while Americanus were labelled "stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs". &lt;i id="africanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Africanus&lt;/i&gt; women were denoted as being "without shame" while both sexes were said to be "crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice".

But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images An exhibition at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums on race has led to intervention from the Trump White House (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;An exhibition at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums on race has led to intervention from the Trump White House (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are – none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology "racial essentialism". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Descent of Man&lt;/a&gt; that there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Two people from Ethiopia and Namibia will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230227-the-search-for-the-worlds-missing-genomes" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;unravel how this alters people's health&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/?data=%221000genomes%22&amp;amp;chr=1&amp;amp;pos=222087833" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;geographic location&lt;/a&gt; and can be traced through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1424033112" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;historic migration patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of "black". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships – many of which would not have been consensual – with enslaved people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Therefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as "black" similarly does not make biological sense. They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term "black". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777682" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infection&lt;/a&gt; among black people. But this is a correlation not a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/arts/design/trump-smithsonian-race.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;troubling many in the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Trump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. "You have good genes, you know that, right?" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota – a state that is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/bemidjicityminnesota" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 80% white&lt;/a&gt;. "You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Similarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ckg0xk3dw55t?post=asset%3A2975891e-69db-431a-aead-2c8217cf871e#post" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;denounced immigrants as having "bad genes"&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard for someone who studies genes – and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics – to understand even what might constitute a "bad" or "good" gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ours may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:00:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPV1BJazRjLVdPSGh6M1FvT0pmX0N0N2k4SVFlZXk5UFA4Ni1acDlxZnJ5TndyZ0RjVWVSZnZVWnZ3aGJIM1laT3RzWUprVjhDUVZCcUNXakJEWlZvU3hxbEt6bEM3VUFCdFJpSmpwcmZobF9CQVZ3alBzOGtuTGRzLW9rZ1FnTmVXTjRSS3JRZUVVSzVWejlvNkpIMXlMdFZyallN</guid></item><item><title>在罕见的诊断之后， Coeur d 'Alene男士正在击败赔率- Coeur d' Alene Press | After rare diagnosis, Coeur d'Alene man is beating the odds - Coeur d'Alene Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOaFVWVnZ4dURWcEpabGFsVGJ3aXBBN2JqZUR2MU9KNDdWOWpFUm9VeWxGMXRzcjdtcmNISzVlWU5nMjktQVFEZHh6WWdTTWZnNG11OFZkUFp3LUJBYW5XemZBaFA1cUQ5ZE5reUF1cHlod2w0dmFSUGU0Z28zNXNRdlkxRmxwZUxreVVXRjZ2cFVnRy1FYjViQ1R4VUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-body font-weight-normal fr-view" id="storycontent"&gt;
	
		
		

			
				
			

			
				
				
				
	                                &lt;p&gt;COEUR d’ALENE — In many ways, Riley Cremer is just like most 21-year-olds in North Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;The Coeur d’Alene native graduated from Coeur d’Alene High School in 2022 and from Northwest Lineman College in southern Idaho just a year later. Riley is an outdoorsman, works as an apprentice electrical lineman and spends his free time working on his truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;He is also a survivor, recently beating incredibly tough odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Riley’s health took a sudden and serious turn in May of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“What initially looked like a bad stomach bug turned out to be an unknown virus or infection that would shut down his liver,” said Riley’s mom, Alysha Cremer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Though he recovered briefly from the initial infection, Riley continued to experience health problems, and extensive blood testing led to the diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a rare and serious blood disorder that occurs when the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells and platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Only about two out of every 1 million Americans receive this diagnosis each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Because of the rarity of the disease, Riley and his parents were sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for answers. After a few months of extensive testing, doctors were able to confirm that inflammation in Riley’s body from the initial infection had led to him developing severe autoimmune aplastic anemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“His body attacked his own bone marrow, leaving him profoundly anemic: without white blood cells to help protect him from other infections, or platelets to give him the ability to stop bleeding even from minor cuts,” Cremer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Aplastic anemia is treatable only by bone marrow transplant; though Riley was initially slated for a transplant in late November, a severe lung infection called aspergillus landed him in inpatient care for 26 days, followed by near-constant blood transfusions after being released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;After several readmissions to the hospital, doctors decided to move forward with the transplant despite the lung infection. Following transplant conditioning, which involves chemotherapy and radiation, Riley’s bone marrow transplant was completed Dec. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“This was his only chance at survival,” Cremer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Now, after nearly 100 days post-transplant, Riley has beaten the odds and returned home, where he is recovering in his new house that he bought just before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Though the curability of aplastic anemia is 90% with a transplant, Cremer explained, Riley remains immunocompromised and will most likely be out of work for the next year due to the physically demanding nature of being a lineman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;To help offset expenses from Riley’s treatment and his family’s relocation to Rochester, a GoFundMe called “Help Riley Get a Life-Saving Bone Marrow Transplant” has been set up by friends of the family. Donations can also be mailed to P.O. Box 2041, Hayden, ID 83835.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“Riley and his family keep faith that he will fully recover to live a purposeful life of good health and outdoor adventures,” Cremer said.   &lt;/p&gt;

Camping in the evenings, she was feverish. When she coughed, blood came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the hallucinations started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was on my own in this expanse of baked earth,” Madhvani, now 35, told Euronews Health. “And I just had this physical feeling that I was dying”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she finally finished the race and made it back to the UK, doctors told her she had the flu, then a chest infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-rays and phlegm testing later confirmed Madhvani actually had tuberculosis (TB) – making her one of about 6.9 million people worldwide to be diagnosed that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Madhvani 11 days in a hospital isolation unit and nearly a year of daily pills to recover from the disease, and another year to feel like herself again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Progress was so slow,” said Madhvani, an event manager in Leeds. “I had been walking around for quite a while with this deadly thing inside of me, and I had no idea… Some of those things still linger a little bit”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB is often thought of as a relic of the 19th century, when “consumption” was believed to be responsible for a quarter of all deaths in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease, killing an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/10/29/tb-is-once-again-the-worlds-deadliest-infectious-disease-analysis-finds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.25 million people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. TB mostly affects countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific, and it is often called a “social disease” because of its close links to poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a downturn during the COVID-19 pandemic, wealthy countries like the UK are now seeing a resurgence of TB that experts say is the canary in the coal mine for other health issues related to social deprivation – everything from other infectious diseases to chronic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because TB is the archetypal disease of poverty… it really is a sentinel for other conditions,” Dr Tom Wingfield, an infectious disease doctor and deputy director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine’s Centre for TB Research, told Euronews Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TB cases up across the UK&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;England reported 5,480 TB cases last year, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tuberculosis-cases-in-england-continued-to-increase-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;up 13 per cent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 on top of an 11 per cent increase the year before – the biggest annual jump since &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/tuberculosis-national-action-plan-2026-to-2031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at least 1971.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s now common enough that a clinic in East London, which has more new TB cases than anywhere else in Western Europe, is opening a £4.63 million (€5.55 million) &lt;a href="https://www.bartscharity.org.uk/our-news/experts-unite-to-tackle-tuberculosis-in-east-london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;centre for TB patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It treated 294 patients last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB is caused by a bacteria that can lie dormant in the lungs for decades before attacking the rest of the body, notably the spine and brain. The only vaccine currently available helps prevent the disease among young children, but is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00283-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most new cases in England have been among immigrants who may have been infected years before their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the second year in a row, TB cases are also on the rise in England among those born in the UK after they’d fallen every year since 2012. Infections are also up in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uptick in cases is likely due in part to disruptions in medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning a backlog of TB infections is only now being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a big enough increase that these delays are likely only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_3" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="3" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB risks are higher among people who are homeless, living in crowded settings, currently or formerly imprisoned, have a history of drug or alcohol misuse, or are grappling with undernutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late 2024, just 13.1 per cent of England’s TB patients aged 15 or older reported at least one social risk factor – but with data missing, it’s likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know pretty well from the figures where the rises are coming from. The why is still a bit of a mystery,” Paul Sommerfield, executive trustee of TB Alert, a non-profit focused on TB in the UK and India, told Euronews Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to combat TB&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) asked experts to weigh in on an updated 5-year action plan to better prevent, detect, and control TB in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_4" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="4" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current plan aimed to curb delays in diagnosis like the one Madhvani faced, have most patients finish their treatment, do more testing for TB, and ensure health workers can spot the signs of TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s still unclear whether enough money will be attached to the new plan, particularly for efforts to raise awareness in high-risk communities about symptoms and how to access medical care, Sommerfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UKHSA declined to answer questions about the new plan’s priorities or budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued to Euronews Health, Dr Esther Robinson, head of the agency’s TB unit, called the disease a “serious public health issue” and urged people to get tested if they have symptoms, including a persistent, mucus-ridden cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_5" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="5" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wingfield has some ideas for the plan. He wants more screenings for new immigrants at risk of TB, given few eligible people are actually tested, and suggested that employers who recruit from overseas could help fund the programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wants the government to collect more information on TB patients’ social and financial problems, so they can be connected to housing, food banks, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many TB doctors in the UK “have given money from out of their pocket to somebody that they've looked after to get food, to pay for a bus… or because they're just in a dire situation,” Wingfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Madhvani pointed to gaps in mental health support for TB patients, particularly once they wrap up treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_6" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="6" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think that the system understands how frightening it is and how lonely it is, especially when you finish treatment and then you're just spat out into the world. There’s no more follow-up,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Identifying TB early to make treatment easier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bright spot is that few UK patients have forms of TB that are resistant to drugs, which can make it harder and more expensive to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug resistance poses a bigger problem in countries where people struggle to access medical care or stop treatment early. The drugs cause sometimes painful side effects, and people are supposed to take them every day for four to nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a fairly good system for dealing with TB, but it's a matter of finding people soon enough to treat them properly,” Sommerfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_7" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="7" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people who are infected with TB never go on to develop the disease. But rooting out infections early is critical for patients like Madhvani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t know how she got TB. But before her diagnosis, she unknowingly infected her partner, friends, family members, and colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most didn’t go on to develop the disease, but her mother did, and she is still struggling with health complications seven years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another person Madhvani infected had latent TB, but no disease yet. Doctors put him on medication to stave off illness, but he stopped taking it early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_8" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="8" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, “he sent me a photo of him in hospital, emaciated… and he looked more unwell than I ever was,” Madhvani said. Her gut reaction was anger that he hadn’t taken TB seriously enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think people understand what it will do to you if you don't get it sorted,” she said. “It doesn't matter how wealthy you are, whether you've travelled or not travelled. If you come into contact with it, you're at risk”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 08:00:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQY1lrN2tub1ZyY0hLRlp3TFpONjlzQXNUMUZxd1ExT2FYT3NZcDBRR3lwMHZkT0F6QlVZbFdnWkhKNFRWaF9SYkNNR1g5Ynh3UEtsb3dXVktZNWxHbW5tYjd3S2JrR05xcldDV3J4cGdCb0R5N0M2eUVCNXhzMGZiZnU2LVRtYWlKRTlFT1FKRHpDb0lXME9HU3JkanVVZklnNEhzUENCLXZLdDNBUDJHVTdFSVh2bXlmWFM2azVWa056dw</guid></item><item><title>控制胆固醇水平的8种饮食习惯-印度时报 | 8 diet practices to control cholesterol level - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;10 tips to sharpen IQ and increase conce...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;Signs zinc, magnesium and calcium are yo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:19:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>锅腹不仅仅与外观有关：专家解释为什么它是您健康的危险信号-印度时报 | Pot belly is not just about the looks: Experts explain why it is a red flag for your health - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pot belly isn’t just about how you look in jeans or whether you can squeeze into that old t-shirt. It’s much more serious than a cosmetic concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to top doctors and nutritionists across India, a pot belly is a visible sign of a much deeper health risk—one that affects your heart, liver, hormones, and even mental health. And the worst part? It sneaks up gradually, often starting as early as your teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it all down—what causes a pot belly, why it’s dangerous, and how you can tackle it before it turns into a full-blown health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Apurva Shah, Consultant, Gastroenterology at Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad, defines a pot belly as an accumulation of abdominal fat, especially the dangerous kind called visceral fat. This fat wraps around your internal organs and messes with how your body functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just “extra weight.” It’s a health red flag linked to heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, and in serious cases? It can spiral into heart attacks, liver failure, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah points out that while belly fat is usually seen in adulthood, its roots often begin in adolescence. Think processed snacks, too much screen time, no exercise—sound familiar? These patterns settle in your body and lay the groundwork for fat to gather around your belly like an unwanted guest who refuses to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress, sleep &amp;amp; belly fat: The toxic trio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hemalata Arora, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Nanavati Max, says stress and sleep deprivation are two major culprits behind a growing waistline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re stressed, your body pumps out cortisol—a hormone that’s meant to help in short bursts. But chronic stress keeps cortisol levels high, which tells your body to store fat—right around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add poor sleep to the mix, and it’s a recipe for disaster. You overeat (especially junk), your metabolism slows down and hormonal imbalance triggers more fat storage. So if you’re pulling all-nighters or constantly feeling wired and tired, your belly is paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fat heads straight to your stomach&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk hormones and aging. As we grow older, our metabolism naturally slows down, and we burn fewer calories even when resting. That alone is enough to cause gradual fat gain. Dr. Arora explains that belly fat cells have more receptors for cortisol, making your tummy a hotspot for stress-related weight. Combine that with age-related drops in muscle mass, and you've got a situation where fat starts piling up—especially in the midsection. Also, thanks to our modern, carb-heavy diets, insulin resistance kicks in. This makes it easier for sugar to convert to fat, and guess where the body loves to store it? Yep, the belly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet is the ultimate game changer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitian Karuna Chaturvedi from Max Super Speciality Hospital says cutting belly fat starts with mindful eating and controlling calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load up on greens &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat fibre-rich berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3 rich fish &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex carbs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what to avoid? Sweets, deep-fried food, aerated drinks, and anything ultra-processed. These are belly fat’s best friends and your worst enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, drink water, stay active, and sleep like it’s your job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health risks to know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajesh Padhan from Marengo Asia Hospitals drops a truth bomb: a pot belly is linked to serious diseases beyond diabetes and heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly fat increases inflammatory chemicals in your body, elevates blood pressure and cholesterol, interferes with insulin function, fuels non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), boosts risk of cancers like colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer and leads to sleep apnea, hormone issues, and mental health struggles. This kind of fat also plays mind games—lowering self-esteem, increasing anxiety, and dragging down your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pot belly is a signal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That belly bulge isn’t just a sign that you overate biryani last weekend. It’s a warning that your body is struggling to keep up with stress, poor habits, and metabolic chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With small, consistent changes in food, movement, sleep, and mindset, your belly (and everything else) will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time you notice your waistband tightening, don’t reach for the looser pants—reach for a lifestyle shift. Because your health deserves more than just damage control. It deserves a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>犹他大学生物化学家被评为2025年《时代》杂志最具影响力的人物之一- KSL新闻 | University of Utah biochemist named one of Time's most influential people of 2025 - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPLUtpYll1MGtPdHhsSmpwWVRuSFhnZmR0WmlzUkw4empvVThWanZvM0h0T3dDWEhheEsyLUVNUkhIanJEeTE3VmNOVXQ5MkZid1BiNXlHQTRHZjNYalFCYU1NeVdCWlhpd3BSYld5T1hDeGRkMHBkZnd5YUNwbXlXdENQd3k3U1hkNkMxVEhqM01fMHBwNWZNQVVYTXdyalhhWnpic1kxNlBQS0lWSWptVzZvNVNWTEZa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — What do actress and comedian Kristen Wiig, President Donald Trump, journalist David Muir and a University of Utah biochemistry professor have in common? They were all listed among &lt;a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273749/tomas-cihlar-and-wesley-sundquist/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's 100&lt;/a&gt; most influential people in the world on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Sundquist, co-chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the U., is being recognized with his co-recipient, Tomas Cihlar, a virologist for Gilead Sciences, for their work that led to a first-of-its-kind HIV treatment and prevention drug lenacapavir. Time magazine recognized the pair for their decades of work that led to what scientific journal Science called &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Breakthrough of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 2024: a twice-a-year injectable that has shown a nearly 100% efficacy rate in preventing HIV infection for at-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was completely surprised when I got the call," said Sundquist, "but I feel like I'm representing a lot of people who have worked hard on this project ... so it was great (news)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist and his biochemistry lab were responsible for their work studying HIV capsids — the protein shell responsible for protecting and releasing the virus' genetic material — in the late '90s. They began by studying how HIV is built on a molecular level. They discovered that the capsid's structure is extremely sensitive, making it an ideal target for disrupting the virus' ability to infect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery was passed on to collaborators like Cihlar at biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, who began researching drugs that targeted the HIV capsid. This eventually led to Gilead developing and manufacturing lenacapavir, known as its brand name &lt;a href="https://www.sunlenca.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Sunleca.&lt;/a&gt; Similar HIV treatment drugs are taken as a daily pill and work by targeting the virus after it enters the cell, but lenacapavir is a long-acting treatment that only requires an injection every six months and interferes with the infection process at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist followed the drug's development as a consultant through the years. He says his research began as a way to contribute to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was doing a (postdoctoral program) in Cambridge, England, and then typically you're hired to run your own lab, and you have to decide what the lab should work on," said Sunquist. "That was during the time when the death rate from HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the U.S., and there wasn't a clear end in sight. So the science interested me, but it was also clearly going to be a very important medical problem that needed lots of perspectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death rate from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV, has reduced significantly in the U.S. since 1994, when it became the leading cause of death for Americans ages 25 to 44, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline#year-1994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federal website&lt;/a&gt; for HIV. But it still remains a prevalent issue &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/global-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;, especially in eastern and southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead is working on getting lenacapavir approved to be used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis — or PrEP — to prevent HIV contraction, since it is currently only approved to treat the virus. Clinical trials using the drug as PrEP were conducted in South Africa and Uganda, proving the drug to be successful in preventing HIV infection in almost 100% of at-risk participants, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/us-fda-accepts-gileads-new-drug-applications-for-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-under-priority-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Gilead&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the drug applications under priority review and has a target action date of June 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's every reason to expect that it will be very, very successful. The clinical trials certainly indicate that," said Sundquist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist doesn't spend as much time in the lab as he did early on in his career, but he confirmed that the university's biochemists are still working with the HIV capsid and studying other aspects of what viruses can teach scientists about cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Time's list of the most influential people in 2025 only formally recognized Sundquist and Cihlar for their work in HIV treatment and prevention, Sundquist says many others contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working on hard problems takes time, and it takes support and a lot of people," he said. "I would say the most important contributions were made by graduate students and postdoctoral (students). ... I think that's important to emphasize that science is a team sport, and Gilead really deserves enormous credit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What causes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;? This severe mental illness, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;over 20 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and is characterised by recurrent hallucinations and delusions, often begins to emerge in the period from adolescence to early adulthood. It's a complex disorder that affects almost every area of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about why schizophrenia develops &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36370183/"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may be linked to changes in brain development during this critical period of emerging adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is also &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314464"&gt;thought to be similar&lt;/a&gt; to conditions such as dyslexia,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;), which are neurodevelopmental but usually manifest in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvN7R1oRuOI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124003585"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that accelerated brain ageing could be another potential driver in the development of schizophrenia – and this can be measured using a simple blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study is unique because we measured proteins in blood derived directly from brain neurons – the brain's nerve cells – in people suffering from schizophrenia. This protein, called neurofilament light protein (NfL), consists of long, thread-like structures that help maintain the size and shape of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NfL is released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid when brain neurons are damaged or undergo neurodegeneration. Its release when these cells are damaged makes it a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/14/11624"&gt;useful biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and neurological damage. Measuring the levels of NfL can also provide insight into the extent of neuronal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal injury is damage or harm to neurons, the specialised cells in the nervous system essential for communication in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. When neurons are injured, their ability to function properly is impaired, which can result in a range of neurological symptoms depending on the severity and location of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raised levels of NfL have been associated with a range of neurological conditions including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, multiple sclerosis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease and frontotemporal dementia. But NfL levels also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37511382/"&gt;normally increase with age&lt;/a&gt; as these proteins lose the ability to repair themselves as effectively. This is due to a combination of factors including gradual wear-and-tear on neurons over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reductions in the brain's grey matter, white matter and connectivity are all part of normal, healthy ageing, these changes are usually gradual and not disabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey matter contains most of the brain's neurons and is responsible for processing information, memory, decision-making, muscle control, and seeing and hearing. White matter is the long fibres that connect different brain regions, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticeable symptoms of normal, healthy brain ageing might include a bit more forgetfulness, slower reaction time, and difficulty juggling multiple tasks. Such changes are very different from the patterns seen in illnesses like schizophrenia where, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/40/5/1140/1924488"&gt;our study shows&lt;/a&gt;, the decline is faster and more severe, indicating an older brain age than would be expected from the patient's chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIFPUpqS5dc?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research found that, in people with schizophrenia, NfL levels appeared to increase more quickly with age, compared with the rate of increase in healthy people, indicating an acceleration of the brain ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also studied samples from people suffering from bipolar disorder, which did not show the same accelerated increase. Data from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00330-z"&gt;other methods&lt;/a&gt;, such as calculating "brain age" from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans, also points to accelerated brain ageing in people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people suffering from schizophrenia, accelerated ageing of the body is already a serious problem, as Christos Pantelis, a Melbourne psychiatrist and senior author of our study, explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important problem is that people with chronic schizophrenia are often exposed to an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7796511/#abstract1"&gt;unhealthy lifestyle overall&lt;/a&gt;. They can experience isolation, unemployment, lack of physical activities, smoking – and many resort to illicit drug use that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cannabis-increased-schizophrenia-risk-in-young-people-linked-to-both-low-and-high-use-175463"&gt;can make their condition worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/12/2366"&gt;a life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; 20-30 years shorter than the average. This is mainly due to earlier development of common age-related diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/45/12/987/7611764"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/schizophrenia"&gt;Around half&lt;/a&gt; of people with schizophrenia have at least one other chronic medical condition, such as obesity, respiratory conditions, chronic pain and substance-use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK571451/"&gt;a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of substance-use disorders due to a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors. These include self-medication for distressing symptoms, impaired cognitive function, social isolation, and difficulties with treatment adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle is a factor in the accelerated ageing of the body for those living with schizophrenia, our study could prove another important step in understanding – and in time, treating – this distressing disease.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/239979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The drugs also had the added benefit of keeping them quiet. They didn’t necessarily need to take the tablets at weekends or during the holidays – the aim was to improve their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs were also viewed as a temporary fix. The children might take them for a few months or a couple of years, but as they aged and their behaviour improved, they would stop taking them – usually by the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, today this has all changed. The number of children diagnosed with ADHD has surged, with diagnoses for boys doubling since 2000, and tripling for girls over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has also been a sea change in how the condition is understood. No longer is it viewed as a temporary behaviour issue, but as a lifelong condition which requires constant, often daily, medical treatment for years, if not for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joanna Moncrieff began her career as an NHS psychiatrist more than 30 years ago, and says she has grown more concerned about the number of children on stimulant pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, nearly 250,000 people in England received ADHD prescriptions on the NHS – a more than threefold rise from 81,000 in 2015. Of those, more than 60,000 are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I am not a child psychiatrist, but I have spent my career doing research into drug treatments for all sorts of mental health problems. And over the years I have grown increasingly concerned about the number of children on these stimulant pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main problems is that children do not like taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A US study, which asked children on stimulants how the pills made them feel, found they regularly described the drugs making them feel ‘numb’ or ‘sad’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some described how, while on stimulants, they ‘don’t smile’ or ‘feel like myself’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then there are the physical consequences to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another US study found that children on stimulants were, on average, 1.5in (4cm) shorter than their peers who also had ADHD but were not taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite these side-effects, many psychiatrists who prescribe the tablets – both on the NHS and privately – say those consequences are a necessary evil. This is because, they argue, the pills help children perform better in school and, ultimately, have brighter futures as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, growing research has thrown this justification into question. Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why I, and an increasing number of my colleagues, believe we need to think again about the rising use of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS defines ADHD as a condition where the brain works differently to most people. Children diagnosed with it are often those who have trouble concentrating or sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-91c5cc20-1d25-11f0-b008-49fe5fdecb05" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14627875/children-ADHD-drugs-stunt-growth-psychiatrist-Joanna-Moncrieff.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is ADHD?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Constant fidgeting &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Poor concentration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Excessive movement or talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Acting without thinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to deal with stress &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Little or no sense of danger &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Careless mistakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Mood swings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Forgetfulness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Difficulty organising tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt; Continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to listen or carry out instructions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Premature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;NHS Choices &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms, according to the Health Service, include being easily distracted, making impulsive decisions and finding it hard to listen to what people are saying or to follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This definition of ADHD has long been contested. Many, like myself, point out that you would be hard-pressed to find a child who didn’t show several of these symptoms at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no blood test or scan you can take to get an ADHD diagnosis. So it’s left completely up to the judgment of the doctor to decide whether a patient has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research also shows that symptoms fluctuate, meaning children show them at some times and not others. This flies in the face of the idea that ADHD is a lifelong condition originating in a different sort of brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But another contentious issue is the drugs that are used to treat it, which have remained largely the same for nearly 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first research into treating ADHD dates back to 1937, when an American psychiatrist experimented with giving children with behavioural issues a daily dose of the stimulant drug amphetamine (then known as benzedrine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time the drug was used by factory workers to help them get through long shifts filled with repetitive tasks. Today, the same substance is taken by recreational drug-takers and is better known by its street name, speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study, which earlier this month was highlighted in The New York Times, concluded that benzedrine had a ‘spectacular’ effect on problem children. According to their teachers, many children showed ‘remarkably improved school performance’ and, overnight, became ‘placid and easygoing’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is this research which has paved the way for millions of prescriptions of these stimulant drugs to be given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular stimulant to be prescribed to children with ADHD is methylphenidate, also known by its brand name Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in recent years, studies have called into question the benefits of stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One such study, published in 2022, involved children aged seven to 12 attending a two-month summer camp in the US. Half their time was spent doing classroom learning. Researchers randomly split the children into two groups. Half received a daily dose of Ritalin, while the other half were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in the classroom, the children taking Ritalin appeared to work faster and were better behaved than those on the placebo. However, at the end of the teaching periods, the two groups underwent tests and the results showed that the children on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ritalin hadn’t learnt any more than their non-drugged campmates. The drugs don’t improve the brain function of ADHD patients, they simply change behaviour temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teachers and parents see hard-working, quiet children. The children may feel they are doing better too, but as the research shows, the drugs do not improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also the long-term consequences of these pills to consider. We already know that they can stunt growth, and even delay puberty in boys. There are also worries that, in rare cases, stimulants can damage the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But I am also concerned that stimulants might negatively affect children’s personality development. Children who act out need to learn to be responsible for their actions. If they are told they are sick and can only be normal with the help of medication, they may never learn how to control their own behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, it’s true that many children do have attention problems and struggle in school. The number getting mobile phones has probably only made this issue worse. Some children find a large institution like school difficult. They find the work boring and don’t feel they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, when children diagnosed with ADHD leave school and find something that interests and motivates them, they do really well. This suggests it’s the environment that’s the problem, not the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I wouldn’t like to say that no child should ever be prescribed stimulants, but it seems wrong that we are having to give children drugs to enable them to fit into modern-day life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;I hated how these drugs made me feel - but I'd have failed my exams without their help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It was the summer of 2014, I was deep into A-level revision and my mornings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;all began the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;After breakfast I would take two small, white pills. By the time I had showered, my heart would be beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I’d ignore this and sit at my desk, where I’d often stay for four or five hours at a time, not even getting up to go to the toilet or eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The pills were Ritalin, a stimulant ADHD medication I had been prescribed two years previously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;As a child I’d been quiet and well-behaved. However, at 14 things changed drastically when my parents’ divorce threw home life into chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I would skip school, argue with teachers and disrupt lessons. When I could be convinced to sit still, my mind wandered and I’d spend more time doodling than doing any work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Six months before my GCSEs (pictured left), I was on course to fail them all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;In desperation, my parents took me to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The idea was to take them every day, but I quickly found that was impossible. When I took them at school, my concentration on tasks would improve, but I also found it challenging to talk or write essays. It was as though the pills dulled my creativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;They also made me anxious, and anti-social, and took away my appetite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I discovered the best way to use them: revision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Previously, revising for exams was so boring that I couldn’t manage it. But on Ritalin it became the most fascinating and important task in the world, and I managed to gain decent grades in my exams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;At A-level, being able to pick my subjects meant I’d begun to enjoy school – particularly English. However, feeling the pressure to get the grades &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I needed for my university of choice, Edinburgh, I turned again to Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;These revision days passed in a haze, where I was unable to talk or eat very much at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;However, the tactic paid off. I got top marks and gained a university place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;That was the last time I took Ritalin. It had helped me, but I hated the way it made me feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The experience also made me realise that it was within my own abilities to sit down and revise. So I decided to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;go drug-free at university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;More than a decade on, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I often forget that I was once labelled with ADHD. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I work long hours and find my job incredibly engaging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;While I’m thankful that the drugs helped get me through exams, I firmly believe my behaviour problems were a temporary issue triggered by what was going on at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;And, eventually, I simply outgrew that behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQem9aeEVoREJOU3hEUVd4RmpmZ0NOV3NNRWlWelprUzlwUWVDOUM2X2ZvSWk0QmlHcVlsaVdBdTNuak9Jc0xWUEdOQWhRcjdVNmZKcmFoZ3ZTV2RIcWVJZWVCSVhMdlEwekRqamQ2UVJ6TmtNSDd0OVRNalpjUHhhZDFRbnVhelBrR0Z1UlNjOXBqZlFBQzhUb0hBbVJHeXVkTWVHVnk2MU1pRGgwRERoTGk0RGVmYWo4WUFr</guid></item><item><title>通常用于诊断疾病的CT扫描可能导致5%的癌症：研究- Straight Arrow News | CT scans, often used to diagnose illness, could cause 5% of cancer: Study - Straight Arrow News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQMWhSV21CZm5vbGYxWFBpeHVkbGplckFGQkJibk96OHRjMC00cU5qRDBNOUVSdmxleHJZT2l1aEV4VlY5Z25mWThFRVI5dTRGQlp4WjVOTHJwM01ybm91TUl0eDBUT0s4eGVBbUtCWjNtYldQSXA5aWVRVW9ybktyR2pPZ0QyM2dubUlReXJ1RzEyVVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="san-syndication-wrapper wp-block-san-syndication-wrapper"&gt;
	
	

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CT scans, a valuable tool in diagnosing a range of illnesses and complications, could in fact be responsible for around 5% of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S. each year. That would put it in league with some of the most infamous causes of cancer, including cigarette smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;According to researchers, many CT scans are “low-value” and add little information to an individual’s diagnosis. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study looked at projections from hospitals in 20 states, and represents a statistical model –– not patient outcomes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-full-story"&gt;Full Story&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CT scans, a valuable tool in diagnosing a range of illnesses and complications, could in fact be responsible for around 5% of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S. each year, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#:~:text=Question%20How%20many%20future%20cancers,approximately%20103%20000%20future%20cancers." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The study, led by UC San Francisco epidemiology professor Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, analyzed projections from hospitals in 20 states, and looked at 93 million CT scans from 61.5 million patients nationwide in 2023. What they found is that roughly 103,000 cancer diagnoses, representing about 5% of all cancers nationwide, could be linked to CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Medical imaging has potential benefits,” &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/16/g-s1-60488/ct-scan-cancer-risk-ionizing-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said Smith-Bindman&lt;/a&gt;, before cautiously adding, “It has potential harms as well, and it’s really important to balance them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-ct-scans-such-a-problem"&gt;Why are CT scans such a problem?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, since 2007, the use of CT scans –– otherwise known as computed tomography scans –– have increased by 35%. However, some of these scans, the researchers argue, are “low-value” and do nothing for diagnosing a problem. It’s a gamble to use CT scans when not absolutely necessary, as radiation emitted during the procedure has long been recognized as harmful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the amount of radiation a CT scan emits is not standardized, meaning one scanning facility could emit 50 times more radiation than another, despite an operator performing the same procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing you can do about radiation that you’ve been exposed to already. But you want to limit future exposure to cases when you really need it,” &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/16/g-s1-60488/ct-scan-cancer-risk-ionizing-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Smith-Bindman told NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-at-a-statistical-model-not-patient-outcomes"&gt;Looking at a statistical model, not patient outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of Smith-Bindman’s study, &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/News-and-Publications/Media-Center/2025/jama-ct-scan-radiation-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the American College of Radiology issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; clarifying that its findings were based on statistical modeling, not actual patient outcomes, as NPR notes. Likewise, to date, there are no published studies that directly link CT scans to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-we-do-about-it"&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean an individual necessarily has to undergo a CT scan or expose themselves to radiation. According to Smith-Bindman, one way to lower the risk would be to no longer administer “low-value” scans. Additionally, standardizing doses so that patients are getting the lowest possible amount of radiation would help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need patients to ask their doctors, ‘Can you use low dose when you scan me?’ ” Smith-Bindman said. “It’s crazy that patients have to ask for it, but it’s actually really successful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should their projections prove true, CT scans could be one of the leading causes of cancer alongside cigarette smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption, which account for 19%, 7.6% and 5%, of cancer cases, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, according to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2025.1490621/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Frontiers in Oncology, it seems that scientists have reached a consensus that medical cannabis can play a vital role in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Castle, the lead author of the study and the research director at the Whole Health Oncology Institute, stated that the study intended to finally solidify the agreement of cannabis' potential as a cancer treatment. “Our goal was to determine the scientific consensus on the topic of medical cannabis, a field that has long been dominated by a war between cherry-picked studies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Playbook in cooperation with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect, analyse and share data on patient-reported outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study on cannabis and cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at more than 10,000 studies related to medical cannabis and cancer. This large-scale research surpasses the scale of any previous study in the field. To move beyond bias–conscious or not–it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning,” said Castle. “We wanted to analyse not just a handful, but nearly every major medical cannabis study to find the actual points of scientific agreement", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to analyse these studies, the team made use of an artificial intelligence natural language processing technique called "sentiment analysis". The technique allowed the researchers to verify how many studies had positive, negative and neutral views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The shocking results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The study overwhelmingly supported the use of cannabis in treating cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Additionally, the surprising results also showcased that the drug could fight cancer cells themselves by killing them and stopping their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a shocking degree of consensus in public health research, and certainly more than we were anticipating for a topic as controversial as medical cannabis,” said Castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is cannabis used in medicine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is used in medicine in different forms.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Follicular fluid provides essential nutrients and biochemical signals for developing eggs. Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women’s reproductive health, but are also “very alarming”, Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1a79df02-31a9-47b0-aa8f-8d8b08e2cbe8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘A scary time to be a scientist’: how medical research cuts will hurt the maternal mortality crisis","elementId":"1a79df02-31a9-47b0-aa8f-8d8b08e2cbe8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/trump-medical-research-funding-maternal-mortality"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,” the study states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;From the top of Mt Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, microplastics and smaller nanoplastics have been detected throughout the environment. Food is thought to be a main exposure route: recent studies found them in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub#sec3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;all meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703#sec3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce products&lt;/a&gt; tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Microplastics are particularly dangerous because they can contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals. That includes highly toxic compounds like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/microplastics-phthalates-bpa-pfas-a1059022044/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas, bisphenol and phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption and developmental toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Microplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20published%20in%20the,common%20plastics%20detected%2C%20after%20polyethylene." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;placental&lt;/a&gt; barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s latest paper is part of a &lt;a href="http://www.ecofoodfertility.it/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;larger project&lt;/a&gt; he’s leading for which he has also detected microplastics in human &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11010040" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4457596" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;semen&lt;/a&gt;, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,” Montano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though men are more susceptible to the substance’s toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper notes a “possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics” and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are “very dangerous”. The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The follicular fluid paper offers a “very important finding”, said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is the work in the next phase – we need to quantify,” Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s team is doing similar work, and he’s spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The substances’ ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen – from packaging to storage to utensils – can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Single-use paper coffee cups, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/04/nist-study-shows-everyday-plastic-products-release-trillions-microscopic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can shed&lt;/a&gt; trillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bags &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-tea-bags-study-8770478" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; billions of particles, and microwavable plastic is &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also a problem&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals; wood and stainless steel alternatives are less harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 23:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPOG55QUMtU0t3WDNtVU9DSUdjczlzUTlDV0RnclJBNjRqYUZ4bEJCNkZldEVwLVpITWhlODU1dmVLaFJfcVlHYjVDakxPbi1Za24xYmRZa0gxRGJ1ZjY3T0Z4d2tjYXZ1Vi1NRG0yMktYUzJjSkpXRktCanJEMU93TlpoSGxDVnJxbjJKRC0xQl9PS2NX</guid></item></channel></rss>
