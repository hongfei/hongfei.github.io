Some of the most nutritious foods on earth are also among the most affordable: beans, peas and lentils, collectively known as pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BBU6D52YPBEKPOK5N4G7M6XTWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are high in protein and fiber. They promote gut health, help with weight loss, and improve blood sugar and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/08/apo-b-cholesterol-test/" target="_blank"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. Studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;have also found&lt;/a&gt; that beans, peas and lentils have a low carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FHQMLZZJR5BU3BN4C2DGH5LTQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health authorities recommend that adults eat one to three cups of beans, peas or lentils each week, depending on your calorie needs. Yet most Americans fall short of that goal, consuming on average just a half cup of beans each week, said Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZPY67ORBCTXJUBSLJJO3Q53Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That’s an insanely small amount, given that beans, peas and lentils are such a powerhouse of protein and fiber and other nutrients,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HYSEMT4Y5FG5BDZIBU6KTASRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Gardner was part of a government committee of nutrition experts that issued &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/11/ultraprocessed-foods-plant-protein-dietary-guidelines/" target="_blank"&gt;a report in December&lt;/a&gt; that said that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans should emphasize beans, peas and lentils as a healthy source of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and a good substitute for red and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BXGHSFNTZHG7MCOEQGGVWHXUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He said that adults should aim to eat at least a half cup of beans, peas or lentils per day — rather than per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUAXWMPQK5ANXNQ5CQS4D3KCDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We should be doubling and tripling our bean intake — we should be eating them every day,” Gardner said. “Nutrient-wise they have all of the good stuff and none of the bad stuff — and they tend to be a lot less expensive than other foods. There are few foods that cost as little as beans, peas and lentils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How eating beans can make you healthier&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6S76RUTT7BBW7AZPJDMNMOBNPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are the dried edible seeds found in the pods of a group of plants called legumes, which are among the oldest cultivated crops on earth. Across the globe, nearly every culture includes some type of pulse or legume in their traditional cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ETGXH7EHMZA5THT3MXLBCJZ7RY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That may be in part because of their nutrient density. Pulses typically have several times more protein and fiber than brown rice, corn, wheat and other grains. A single cup of cooked lentils, for example, has 18 grams of protein, the amount in three large eggs. Yet unlike animal foods, they’re naturally free of cholesterol and low in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIIDF6247ZHLNEOVGPWJWGQI2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;All pulses are high in fiber and rich in nutrients such as iron, potassium, magnesium and B vitamins. A cup of cooked lentils &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/06/psyllium-supplement-how-much/" target="_blank"&gt;has 16 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; — more than half the recommended daily amount of fiber that the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label" target="_blank"&gt;average adult needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VLHM5GTYZJGKJDSOT5XKP6S4B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2020, a systematic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1716680" target="_blank"&gt;review of randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who were assigned to eat an average of about a half-cup of cooked beans, peas or lentils daily had striking improvements in their cardiovascular, gut and metabolic health. They lost weight, shrank their waistlines and lowered their cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels. They also had reductions in inflammation and positive changes in their &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/im-gastroenterologist-here-are-8-tips-improve-your-gut-health/" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXWQ2N4TOZHIHFZSOHWMUAXCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers speculated that the health benefits were in large part a result of the ample amounts of fiber in pulses. Beans, peas and lentils contain a special type of fiber called resistant starch, which gets its name because it resists digestion in the small intestine. Resistant starch travels down to the large intestine, where it’s metabolized by gut bacteria that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565693/" target="_blank"&gt;convert it into health-promoting compounds&lt;/a&gt; such as short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SNMDI2X4YJBURNMVWR4HE57T24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the review also looked into potential downsides. Although beans have a reputation for causing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/25/why-farts-gas-smell-bad/" target="_blank"&gt;flatulence&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found that cases of gastrointestinal discomfort were fairly rare and not severe. “None of the participants withdrew from the studies because of these symptoms,” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SJQBQTVRBDZRGULLLW42PLS6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are concerned about gastrointestinal issues, though, one of the best things you can do is to gradually increase the amount of beans, peas and lentils in your diet. This will give your body time to adjust to the increase in fiber, and as your tolerance rises, any initial increase in flatulence should dissipate, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WR66BZBDJZBPBKKFDJKMQER7SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The mantra is to go low and go slow,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Better for your budget and the environment&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JROWOPPCWVGVTELUW35BEA2NQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Damman said that when people ask him what they should eat to improve their health, he recommends beans, peas and lentils “above all other foods,” for both their nutrient content and their low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJ3S56FFVFBGPIOF6VZMKVYOVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They’re a superfood,” he said. “They’re healthy, but they’re also affordable — and that’s really important right now with inflation and today’s economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7GYD6IXHRFULFRYMQPAJVSCFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that pulses are among the lowest-cost sources of protein, with their average prices significantly below that of chicken, beef, pork, turkey, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/11/healthiest-seafood-fish-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;seafood&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds and lamb.

And they have a lower environmental footprint than other protein-rich foods. Growing pulses uses less water and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;produces fewer&lt;/a&gt; greenhouse gas emissions compared with meat production. It also &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/about-us/news-and-blogs/why-you-should-be-eating-more-pulses/" target="_blank"&gt;improves soil quality&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3RJULKA2BBBPBEH5Z7KGXS6TUY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3RJULKA2BBBPBEH5Z7KGXS6TUY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How to eat more beans, peas and lentils&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYUBE6WESJBMZJWPQUCU7N557I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the simplest ways to include more pulses in your diet is to add them to your favorite meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VXU2RVYIANFZDDSMYPHT2CXG5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You don’t have to change very much if you’re just adding them to the foods that you’re already eating,” said Jill Weisenberger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prediabetes-Complete-Lifestyle-Chronic-Illnesses/dp/1637743602/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"&gt;Prediabetes: A Complete Guide, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="5JACS76FJ5DWDHZJL44MSMFHKY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating eggs for breakfast? Pair them with black beans by trying this &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/black-bean-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank"&gt;Washington Post recipe&lt;/a&gt; for high-protein, freezer friendly breakfast burritos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having a sandwich for lunch, add some chickpeas by smearing hummus on your bread instead of mayonnaise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having chicken salad, open a can of white beans and mix some in. “Soft white cannellini beans are really good with tuna or chicken salad,” Weisenberger said. Just make sure to rinse your beans first, which helps to remove sodium, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re making a salad, open a can of cooked beans, peas or lentils and toss a couple spoonfuls in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/13/legume-pasta-edamame-low-carb/" target="_blank"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt; with tomato sauce for dinner, open a can of kidney beans and mix some in. The taste and texture of the kidney beans will complement the sauce, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making chili, soup or stew for a big family dinner? Smash some white beans, and add them to the pot. The smashed beans will thicken up your stew, soup or chili, and no one will even realize they’re in there, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anytime you’re making a recipe with ground beef, replace some of the beef with cooked brown lentils to stretch the meat and add some fiber and extra nutrients. Brown lentils have a mild flavor, and they resemble the appearance and texture of cooked ground beef. Try adding the cooked lentils in a 2-to-1 ratio with the ground beef (2 cups of cooked lentils for each pound of cooked ground beef).

It's commonly encountered in the community, especially among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outbreaks can happen frequently among school-aged children who may present with a lacy rash (described as a 'slapped cheek' appearance when it involves the face) and flu-like symptoms," said Kara Markham, M.D. and professor of obstetrics and gynecology, in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati Health officials said parvovirus infections usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are milder and flu-like, with rashes and joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markham said one-third to two-thirds of pregnant women are not immune to the virus at the start of pregnancy, which means if they contract parvovirus, it's possible the virus can spread to the baby as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that's not typically common, the CDC says the infection can cause a miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a woman is first exposed to parvovirus during pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta to cause fetal infection," said Markham. "If this occurs, the virus can temporarily affect the bone marrow of the baby, preventing the baby from producing red blood cells and/or platelets." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can then result in anemia in the case of a lack of red blood cells, or thrombocytopenia in the case of a lack of platelets, Markham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is estimated that severe anemia can occur in up to 10% of babies infected prior to 20 weeks and the condition may even be severe enough to cause fetal death," said Markham. "However, if physicians are aware of the infection and the potential for fetal anemia, very close monitoring and appropriate treatment can be lifesaving for the baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies who survive do so without long-term issues, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many people don't exhibit symptoms of the infection, those who do will experience them roughly five to 10 days after contact with the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic. Early symptoms of the infection in children can include a fever, upset stomach, headache, runny nose and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic says children infected with parvovirus may also exhibit the face rash, which is red on light-colored skin and can be purplish and harder to see on darker-colored skin. Over time, a second rash can form on the arms, legs, chest, back and buttocks of the child, according to the Mayo Clinic. That rash usually goes away in seven to 10 days, but it can come and go for up to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with parvovirus infections are more likely to get painful, swollen or stiff joints; joint symptoms can be more common in women than men, according to the Mayo Clinic. Those symptoms often affect the hands, wrists, knees, ankles and feet and can last roughly one to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

But it’s often the most important thing they came in for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with &lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;just one more thing&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravindra recalls patients who revealed—as she had one foot out the door—that they’d been experiencing chest pain. Or they were struggling with their mental health and wanted to get her opinion on going on an antidepressant. It’s better to blurt these things out than hide them from your doctor altogether. But the problem is that “we want to be able to pay as much attention as possible to the things that are most important to patients, and that are most important to their health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient mentions something worthy of deeper discussion as an appointment is wrapping up, Ravindra has to make a split-second decision: Should she dive into a conversation with them, and be late to see the next patient (and the one after that)? Or should she ask them to schedule another appointment to discuss whatever they brought up? “Then you risk patients feeling dismissed,” she says. “They made the decision to finally talk about it, and I'm asking them to talk about it another time.” Neither option is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7208914/symptoms-doctors-dismiss-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melinda Steele, a primary care physician in California, can relate. “The ‘just one more thing’ scenario happens &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the time,” she says. It can throw off her entire day. “Doctors are like ducks: We’re calm and collected on the surface, but we’re moving it under the water,” she says. “We’re getting blasted from all different directions, having to triage things, go through messages and labs, and see patients in clinic. It’s better to not be surprised by a doozy when you're trying to get out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make sure you feel heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid falling into the “just one more thing” trap, make sure you’re prepared for doctor’s appointments. Steele suggests making a list of concerns to bring along. Cap it at about three discussion points, and star the top couple things you’d like to discuss, so they get priority over less important issues. “A lot of people come to the doctor's office and they're nervous and forget what they want to bring up, so writing it down can offload some of that and make sure the issues are actually addressed,” she says. “If you have symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, move them to the top of the list and mention them up front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7297252/permethrin-ticks-mosquitoes-insecticide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to work on getting out of the habit of what Steele calls “problem hoarding.” There’s no need to stockpile issues until you have “enough” to justify a visit. “It's pretty common for people to come in with a big list of issues, because they feel like there needs to be enough to justify taking time off work,” she says. “Reaching out to your doctor earlier and tackling issues earlier can definitely prevent complications”—and ensure appointments are as seamless and satisfying as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea, Ravindra says, is to add notes when you schedule your appointment via your online portal. Many systems allow you to enter text describing what you'd like to talk about, and she always reviews them in advance. “Then I have a good sense of, is this going to be a quick, straightforward visit? Or do I need to make sure I allow adequate time?” she says. Plus, people who are nervous about bringing up sensitive topics in-person often feel more at ease putting them on their doctors’ radar virtually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What doctors can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of every appointment, Ravindra asks patients: “What’s on your mind today? Is there anything you want to specifically make sure we cover?” That helps reduce the possibility of being blindsided by “just one more thing" at the end of the allotted time, she’s found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele advises doctors ask patients if they brought a list of concerns, and if so, whether they can look at it together while setting an appointment agenda. “Skim it with the patient, because then you can highlight, ‘Oh, I see you have chest pain as No. 15. Why don't we move that up to the top?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7270606/questions-to-ask-doctor-appointment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also urges clinicians to avoid falling into a rabbit hole and going deep on the first issue a patient brings up. “Doctors are fix-it people,” she says. “We’re listening, but our minds are thinking and strategizing, ‘What could be causing these symptoms, and what am I going to do about it?’” Yet it’s best to hold off on problem-solving until you’ve talked through and ranked a patient’s issues by urgency and priority, she tells doctors, so that an entire appointment isn't accidentally focused on one problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just one more thing—keep in mind that both doctors and patients have the same achievable goal. “At the end of the day, patients want to be heard and cared for, and doctors want the exact same thing” for their patients, Steele says. “Communicating effectively is going to be the best approach for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondering what to say in a tricky social situation?

What's more, vitamin C concentrations normally delivered to human skin via the bloodstream are sufficient to have a measurable effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research from Japan, first-authored by pharmaceutical scientist Yasunori Sato of Hokuriku University, points to vitamin C as a tool for staving off at least some of the impacts of aging on our &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470464/"&gt;largest organ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin C seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biologist Akihito Ishigami of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="165903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/9-foods-that-pack-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;9 Foods That Pack More Vitamin C Than an Orange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy human skin contains high levels of vitamin C, suggesting active accumulation, and concentrations are lower in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01469.x"&gt;aged or UV-damaged skin&lt;/a&gt;. We know that the vitamin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9080866"&gt;plays an important role&lt;/a&gt; in skin health, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.110"&gt;boosting collagen&lt;/a&gt; production, alleviating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34530-4"&gt;UV damage&lt;/a&gt;, and providing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.03.003"&gt;antioxidant protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that vitamin C &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.493"&gt;plays a role&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;demethylation of DNA&lt;/a&gt;, a process of removing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"&gt;methyl groups&lt;/a&gt; that is important for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.675780"&gt;genetic stability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2145-x"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition or removal of methyl groups act like a kind of molecular switch that can turn gene activity on or off, without changing the genomic sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What role demethylation plays in the differentiation of skin cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"&gt;keratinocytes&lt;/a&gt;, however, was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_137472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg" alt="Diagram showing structure of our genetic molecules from chromosome to DNA including methylation" class="size-full wp-image-137472" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When epigenetic factors, which can come from other genes or the environment inside a cell or beyond, recruit a methyl group, it changes the expression of our genes. (ttsz/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis"&gt; epidermis&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by keratinocytes, which form at the very bottommost layer and slowly move upward through its multiple layers as they mature, eventually becoming the dead cells that make up the skin's uppermost layer – the&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"&gt; stratum corneum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stratum corneum consists entirely of dead cells, serving a protective function for the live skin cells underneath. It's from here that dead skin cells are shed, replenished by keratinocytes making their way up from below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the role of vitamin C in skin health, the researchers grew human keratinocytes in petri dishes, with the upper layer exposed to the air, and fed by a nutrient solution from below, mimicking how skin behaves in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into the nutrient solution, the researchers added concentrations of vitamin C consistent with the concentrations delivered by the circulatory system. A separate group of cells was grown without vitamin C as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one week, the models nourished with vitamin C had a thicker layer of living epidermis cells than the control group, while no effect was seen on the stratum corneum. After 14 days, the epidermal cell layer was thicker still, and the stratum corneum showed thinning, suggesting that the vitamin C was promoting cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grapefruit-juice-can-kill-you-evidence-shows?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Grapefruit Juice Can Kill You, Evidence Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sequenced the DNA and RNA of their samples, and traced this cell proliferation to demethylation that appears to be mediated by vitamin C sustaining the function of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TET_enzymes"&gt;enzymes that regulate gene activity through demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These enzymes need a specific form of iron to keep doing their demethylation job, and vitamin C helps regenerate that form of iron. This effectively reactivates the genes associated with cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of vitamin C, the expression of 12 key proliferation genes in the samples was increased, some by as much as 75 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied an inhibitor to the enzyme, the effect was reversed, confirming that vitamin C works through this specific pathway. These results suggest the vitamin may be useful to develop treatments for countering the effects of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that vitamin C helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;Ishigami says&lt;/a&gt;, "making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2025.03.040"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Waking up from a nightmare can leave your heart pounding, but the effects may reach far beyond a restless night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who suffer bad dreams every week were almost &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt; more likely to die before age 75 than people who rarely have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;alarming&lt;/a&gt; conclusion – which is yet to be peer reviewed – comes from researchers who combined data from four large long-term studies in the US, following more than 4,000 people between the ages of 26 and 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, participants reported how often nightmares disrupted their sleep. Over the next 18 years, the researchers kept track of how many participants died prematurely – 227 in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Dangers of Sleep Deprivation Are Very Real, Expert Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after considering common risk factors like age, sex, mental health, smoking and weight, people who had nightmares every week were still found to be nearly three times more likely to die prematurely – about the same risk as heavy smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined "epigenetic clocks" – chemical marks on DNA that act as biological mileage counters. People haunted by frequent nightmares were biologically older than their birth certificates suggested, across all three clocks used (DunedinPACE, GrimAge and PhenoAge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the silent scream&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster ageing accounted for about 39% of the link between nightmares and early death, implying that whatever is driving the bad dreams is simultaneously driving the body's cells &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;towards the finish line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might a scream you never utter leave a mark on your genome? Nightmares happen during so-called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MbLSnGOCDk"&gt;rapid-eye-movement sleep&lt;/a&gt; when the brain is highly active but muscles are paralysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge of adrenaline, cortisol and other fight-or-flight chemicals can be as strong as anything experienced while awake. If that alarm bell rings night after night, the stress response may stay partially switched on throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continuous stress takes its toll on the body. It triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3253267/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and speeds up the ageing process by wearing down the protective tips of our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5590630/"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166466" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg" alt="chromosomes" class="wp-image-166466 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Continuous stress can wear down the protective tips of chromosomes. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, being jolted awake by nightmares disrupts deep sleep, the crucial time when the body &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3256323/"&gt;repairs itself&lt;/a&gt; and clears &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38639025/"&gt;out waste&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level. Together, these two effects – constant stress and poor sleep – may be the main reasons the body seems to age faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that disturbing dreams foreshadow poor health is not entirely new. Earlier studies have shown that adults tormented by weekly nightmares are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nightmares-are-a-good-predictor-of-future-dementia-new-study-191016"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/parkinsons-disease-bad-dreams-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-new-study-184495"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;years before&lt;/a&gt; any daytime symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests that the brain areas involved in dreaming are also those affected by brain diseases, so frequent nightmares might be an early warning sign of neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightmares are also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;surprisingly common&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly 5% of adults report at least one each week and another 12.5% experience them monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166464" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg" alt="person waking from nightmare" class="wp-image-166464 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Around 5% of adults have nightmares at least once a week. (PhotoVic/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are both frequent and treatable, the new findings elevate bad dreams from a spooky nuisance to a potential public health target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioural therapy for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3900619/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4120639/"&gt;imagery-rehearsal therapy&lt;/a&gt; – where sufferers rewrite the ending of a recurrent nightmare while awake – and simple steps such as keeping bedrooms cool, dark and screen free have all been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5991964/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to curb nightmare frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping to conclusions, there are a few important things to keep in mind. The study used people's own reports of their dreams, which can make it hard to tell the difference between a typical bad dream and a true nightmare. Also, most of the people in the study were white Americans, so the findings might not apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And biological age was measured only once, so we cannot yet say whether treating nightmares slows the clock. Crucially, the work was presented as a &lt;a href="https://www.ean.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ean/Congress-2025/EAN2025_Congress_Abstract_Book.pdf"&gt;conference abstract&lt;/a&gt; and has not yet navigated the gauntlet of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="166461" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has important strengths that make it worth taking seriously. The researchers used multiple groups of participants, followed them for many years and relied on official death records rather than self-reported data. This means we can't simply dismiss the findings as a statistical fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If other research teams can replicate these results, doctors might start asking patients about their nightmares during routine check-ups – alongside taking blood pressure and checking cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that tame frightening dreams are inexpensive, non-invasive and already available. Scaling them could offer a rare chance to add years to life while improving the quality of the hours we spend asleep.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260008/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Struggle with math? A gentle jolt to the brain might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003200&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that mild electrical stimulation can boost arithmetic performance – and offers fresh insight into the brain mechanisms behind mathematical ability, along with a potential way to optimize learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could eventually help narrow cognitive gaps and help build a more intellectually equitable society, the authors argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Different people have different brains, and their brains control a lot in their life," said Roi Cohen Kadosh, a neuroscientist at the University of Surrey &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/could-electric-brain-stimulation-lead-to-better-maths-skills-260134"&gt;who led the research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think about the environment – if you go to the right school, if you have the right teacher – but it's also our biology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen Kadosh and colleagues recruited 72 University of Oxford students, scanning their brains to measure connectivity between three key regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chewing-wood-could-give-your-brain-an-unexpected-boost?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chewing Wood Could Give Your Brain an Unexpected Boost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants then tackled math problems that required either calculating answers or recalling memorized solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166458" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642.jpg" alt="maths written on note pad" class="wp-image-166458 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166458" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants calculated mathematical problems while having their brains scanned. (pixelshot/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that stronger connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which governs executive function, and the posterior parietal cortex, involved in memory, predicted better calculation performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied a painless form of brain stimulation using electrode-fitted caps – a technique known as transcranial random noise stimulation – the low performers saw their scores jump by 25–29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes the stimulation works by enhancing the excitability of neurons and interacting with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22857-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-gaba"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;, a brain chemical that inhibits excessive activity – effectively compensating for weak neural connectivity in some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the stimulation helped underperformers reach or even surpass the scores of peers with naturally stronger brain wiring. But those who already performed well saw no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people struggle with things, and if we can help their brain to fulfill their potential, we open them a lot of opportunities that otherwise would be closed," said Cohen Kadosh, calling it an "exciting time" for the field of brain stimulation research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he flagged a key ethical concern: the risk that such technologies could become more available to those with financial means, widening – rather than closing – access gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also urged the public not to try this at home. "Some people struggle with learning, and if our research proves successful beyond the lab, we could help them fulfil their ambitions and unlock opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep quality is important for many different aspects of our health, and there are multiple ways to get better shut-eye – including the right &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experiment-reveals-a-simple-way-to-boost-your-sleep-quality"&gt;bedroom environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the latest research, lots of fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by a team from the University of Chicago and Columbia University in New York, and connects fruit and vegetable intake during the day with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-to-get-a-better-night-s-sleep-according-to-science"&gt;the quality of sleep&lt;/a&gt; that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sleep &lt;span&gt;aids&lt;/span&gt; go, putting a bit more fruit and veg on your plate is a pretty good option: it's cheap, it's natural, and you don't need a prescription. And then of course you get &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-and-vegetables-have-a-surprising-effect-on-depression-risk"&gt;all the other benefits&lt;/a&gt; of these foodstuffs too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cognitive-shuffling-really-could-help-insomniacs-get-to-sleep?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Cognitive Shuffling Really Could Help Insomniacs Get to Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The temporal associations and objectively-measured outcomes in this study represent crucial steps toward filling a gap in important public health knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Esra Tasali, sleep scientist at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved 34 healthy young adults, who were asked to record their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt; for up to a week. Wearable devices were then used to check for sleep fragmentation: essentially, how often people wake up or switch between sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165123" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Diet and sleep chart" class="wp-image-165123 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart-596x415.jpg 596w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart-600x418.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165123" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eating more fruit and vegetables was linked to a lower sleep fragmentation index (SFI) . (Boege et al., &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who ate more fruit and veg tended to have a smoother night of sleep, the researchers found. The same was true for those who ate more healthy carbohydrates, such as whole grains – and the researchers think it's the carbohydrates and fiber in the fruit and veggies that are having the strongest effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via a statistical modeling approach, the researchers suggest that eating the recommended five cups of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/keep-your-fruit-and-veg-fresher-for-longer-with-these-science-backed-hacks"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; per day could improve sleep quality by 16 percent. One cup would be the equivalent of 8 large strawberries, a medium potato, or 22 grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165125" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart.jpg" alt="Produce chart" class="wp-image-165125 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165125" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers helpfully provided some fruit and vegetable measurements. (University of Chicago)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"16 percent is a highly significant difference," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tasali. "It's remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the data from this research isn't enough on its own to show direct cause and effect – other factors, such as income, could have been influencing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-surprising-link-between-food-and-sleep-heres-how-to-eat-for-a-restful-night"&gt;both diet and sleep&lt;/a&gt; – the study team did find a significant relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also fits in with what is previously known about a good diet being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-protein-and-fiber-diet-linked-to-longer-better-sleep-study-finds"&gt;linked to good sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It's an association that makes sense, with our health closely tied to both how much rest we're getting, and what we're putting into our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also likely to be something of a feedback loop going on here as well – which further studies could look into more closely – because research suggests that poor sleep then makes us more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;crave unhealthy foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can say for sure about sleep is that a lot of factors contribute to its quality, whether that's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intense-cold-exposure-might-actually-help-you-sleep-better-study-shows"&gt;body temperature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-15-extra-minutes-of-sleep-is-linked-to-brain-benefits-in-young-people"&gt;the timing of our slumbers&lt;/a&gt;. It's also something that a lot of us &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;, so different approaches to improving sleep are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Marie-Pierre St-Onge, nutritionist at Columbia University. "Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering – better rest is within your control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2025.05.003"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="316" data-end="456"&gt;When I first went vegan, I assumed I had it down. Quinoa? Check. Kale? Check. Vegan cheese, tofu dogs, almond milk everything? Double check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="458" data-end="625"&gt;But here's the thing: I still felt off. I was bloated half the time, weirdly tired after lunch, and constantly snacking even though I was technically eating “healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="627" data-end="935"&gt;So I did what any curious label-reader with a Wi-Fi connection would do: I started digging. Through studies, nutrition forums, and registered dietitian breakdowns. What I found surprised me—not just because I was misinformed, but because I’d &lt;em data-start="869" data-end="900"&gt;been spreading the same myths&lt;/em&gt; to friends thinking I was helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="937" data-end="1054"&gt;Here are six vegan food myths I believed, why they don’t hold up, and what I learned from finally doing the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1061" data-end="1102"&gt;1. “If it’s vegan, it must be healthy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1104" data-end="1308"&gt;This one’s tempting. The label says “plant-based,” so you assume it’s good for you. I used to load up my cart with vegan granola bars, coconut yogurt, and cashew-based desserts thinking I was crushing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1310" data-end="1376"&gt;But as it turns out, "vegan" and "nutrient-dense" aren't synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1658"&gt;A 2022 analysis in &lt;em data-start="1397" data-end="1421"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that many &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.900598/full?.com"&gt;ultra-processed vegan foods&lt;/a&gt; are just as high in sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars as their animal-based counterparts. Some were even &lt;em data-start="1577" data-end="1584"&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; in protein and fiber—which are key to staying full and energized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1660" data-end="1877"&gt;Now, instead of relying on the “vegan” label, I ask: is this food close to its original form? If it grew from the ground and doesn’t need a long ingredients list to explain itself, it’s more likely to nourish my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1884" data-end="1947"&gt;2. “Vegan meat substitutes are always better than real meat”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1949" data-end="2077"&gt;I used to think that swapping burgers for Beyond Burgers was a clear health win. No cholesterol! No cruelty! No question, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2079" data-end="2096"&gt;Well… yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2098" data-end="2344"&gt;While plant-based meat alternatives can reduce your intake of saturated fat and help lower carbon emissions (a 2020 study in &lt;em data-start="2223" data-end="2231"&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; found that plant-based diets can &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_diet?.com"&gt;cut food-related greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; by up to 73%), they’re not all created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2346" data-end="2675"&gt;Many vegan meats are still highly processed and contain additives, gums, and flavor enhancers to mimic meat. And research from &lt;em data-start="2473" data-end="2517"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; shows that some people experience bloating or &lt;a href="https://proveg.org/article/how-to-alleviate-consumer-misconceptions-about-pea-protein/?.com"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; from soy isolates or pea protein concentrates often used in these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2677" data-end="2785"&gt;Now, I use meat substitutes more like “treat” foods—great for cookouts or cravings, but not my daily staple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2792" data-end="2841"&gt;3. “Almond milk is the best dairy alternative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2843" data-end="3003"&gt;Almond milk was my go-to for years. It tasted light, blended well in smoothies, and had that café-approved vibe. But nutritionally? Not as magical as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3005" data-end="3304"&gt;Unless fortified, almond milk is often low in protein and calcium. A 2021 review in &lt;em data-start="3089" data-end="3100"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; found that many commercial plant milks have inconsistent nutrient profiles—and almond milk ranked among the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837?.com"&gt;lowest for protein content&lt;/a&gt; per serving (often just 1 gram compared to soy’s 7–8 grams).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3306" data-end="3403"&gt;What’s more, almonds are water-intensive to grow—so it’s not the most eco-friendly option either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3405" data-end="3600"&gt;These days, I alternate between soy milk (for protein), oat milk (for creaminess), and fortified hemp milk (for omega-3s). No single option is perfect, but I try to match the milk to the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3607" data-end="3642"&gt;4. “More fiber is always better”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3644" data-end="3788"&gt;When I first went vegan, I loaded up on fiber-rich foods: lentils, whole grains, cruciferous veggies, flaxseeds. I figured the more, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3790" data-end="3826"&gt;But my gut said otherwise—literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4223"&gt;Fiber is great for digestion, yes. But when you go from low-to-high fiber overnight (as many do when switching to a plant-based diet), your body can freak out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4223"&gt;A 2020 study in &lt;em data-start="4010" data-end="4052"&gt;The American Journal of Gastroenterology&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that sudden fiber increases can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7056053/?.com"&gt;cause gas, bloating, and discomfort&lt;/a&gt;—especially when water intake is low or gut bacteria aren’t used to breaking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4225" data-end="4380"&gt;I learned to pace myself. I now introduce new fiber sources gradually and drink plenty of water to help things move along. My gut feels way more chill now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4387" data-end="4442"&gt;5. “Vegan means I don't have to worry about protein”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4444" data-end="4649"&gt;Yep, I believed this one hard. I was eating beans, peanut butter, and oats—so I figured I had enough protein. But I was often fatigued, took longer to recover from workouts, and started losing muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4651" data-end="5005"&gt;It turns out, not all plant proteins are equal in terms of amino acid profile and bioavailability. According to a report, older adults (and anyone active) need &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/protein-requirements-by-age?.com"&gt;more protein per kilogram of body weight&lt;/a&gt; than previously thought—and that need can be hard to meet on carbs and nut butter alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5007" data-end="5266"&gt;Once I started tracking (even loosely), I realized I was only getting about 40–50 grams a day. Now I aim for 70–80, and include higher-quality plant proteins like tempeh, seitan, tofu, and legumes combined with grains. Game-changer for my energy and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5273" data-end="5341"&gt;6. “If you eat a balanced vegan diet, you don’t need supplements”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5343" data-end="5510"&gt;For a while, I wore my no-supplement stance like a badge of honor. “I get everything from food!” I’d say. And sure, it sounded impressive—but it wasn’t entirely smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5512" data-end="5678"&gt;The truth is, even well-planned vegan diets can fall short on certain nutrients—namely vitamin B12, vitamin D, omega-3s (EPA/DHA), iodine, and sometimes iron or zinc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5680" data-end="5866"&gt;A 2020 review published in &lt;em data-start="5707" data-end="5718"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; emphasized that while whole plant foods are nutrient-rich, a few essentials are &lt;a href="https://www.saintlukeskc.org/about/news/research-shows-vegan-diet-leads-nutritional-deficiencies-health-problems-plant-forward?.com"&gt;hard to come by without animal products&lt;/a&gt; or fortified foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5868" data-end="6069"&gt;Now I take a B12 supplement, plus an algae-based omega-3. In winter months, I add D3. It's not a sign of failure—it’s smart planning. You wouldn’t drive cross-country without checking your fuel, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6076" data-end="6142"&gt;It’s not about perfect—it’s about paying attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6144" data-end="6357"&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned from busting these myths, it’s that “plant-based” isn’t a finish line. It’s a mindset—one that asks you to stay curious, check your assumptions, and care enough to course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6359" data-end="6504"&gt;I still love being vegan. But now, I love it &lt;em data-start="6404" data-end="6409"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; feel good doing it. No more falling asleep at 3pm or wondering why I’m cranky after breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6506" data-end="6684"&gt;So if you’ve been wondering why your plant-based journey feels off—even when you’re “doing it right”—start with your plate. Not to fix it perfectly. Just to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6686" data-end="6769"&gt;Because when your food works &lt;em data-start="6715" data-end="6721"&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; you, everything else gets just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen said last week that she anticipates more cases in Utah that are yet to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 1,227 measles cases this year, 95% of which were in unvaccinated people or people whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said with 90% of Utahns protected by a vaccine, there is "not a need for significant concern" around measles in Utah. Those who have been vaccinated, she said, will experience a milder infection, recover faster and not transmit the disease to others around them. She encouraged Utahns who are not vaccinated to discuss that decision with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., 12% of cases have required hospitalization, whereas in Utah, at least two of the nine cases have required hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the United States cases, over 700 were located in Texas and 89% of cases are connected to 23 separate outbreaks, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;update last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that new cases have been decreasing; however, its latest updates from June don't reflect the recent cases in Utah. It updates its page with new cases each Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash on the hairline typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, Utah's health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:47:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNZlJ3SHFOZFJWY0d0eWlGaVZUa1FXS3JEVl91UEdGd1gyQW5Jd1ZDVThlc1VyV0VualplQkxZU0J2NkRYanBzS2syY1RILVdHcGppeEY2V3BQR1AzOUkzNGZIT0tVaUtrR2pXVjNsSlNndzhmVE9XOU91ZVgzLV9TeWhOeEprb3Rua0pfcERzSXZGbFJlZEthRA</guid></item><item><title>65岁以上仍有患HPV癌症风险的女性，应接受宫颈癌筛查–研究–《卫报》 | Women over 65 still at risk from cancer from HPV and should be offered cervical screening – study - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSzdDXzRCVEtPRmhUTDM5ZXk1T0ZEclh0cVM2U3BZRnR0YmRpcmNYQW5pNHFqUjNDeGNTc0t5bE5KbmxnZFFuSklTbFlrN3JaeU1rc3IxdkRfR0dlSVFPUkliY2pDU2pSck9CRlE2TGdPVUNqQWZndzN1ZXhWdjQ3cHBMNjBtZDNaQ1I0WFlyMXVUUEdwcDlQY2g5VG1hNkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Routine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cervical-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cervical screening&lt;/a&gt;

on cervical cancer states that by 2030, all countries should vaccinate 90% of girls with the HPV vaccine by 15, screen 70% of women and treat 90% of those with cervical disease. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240014107" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Modelling&lt;/a&gt; suggests this would prevent 62m deaths and a cumulative 74m new cases of cervical cancer by 2120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Screening programmes vary from country to country, but most guidelines recommend stopping cervical screening after the age of 65 if previous test results have been normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet global cases of cervical cancer among people over 65 have been rising: in 2022, worldwide there were 157,182 new cases and 124,269 deaths from the disease among women aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the UK, while screening and vaccination rates are higher than many other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/cervical-cancer-elimination-by-2040-plan-for-england/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they have been falling&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Cervical cancer leads to approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/cervical-cancer/mortality#heading-Zero" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;685 deaths a year in England&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a large-scale observational study published in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine has found that older women are more likely to have HPV infections and to have abnormal cells in test results than younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in China analysed cervical cancer screening data for more than 2 million women between 2017 and 2023. Of the 2 million, 17,420 were aged 65 and above; the remainder were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cells among women aged 65 and over than in younger women. Nearly 14% of those 65 and over tested positive for high-risk HPV infection types, compared with 8% of those who were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older women were also more likely to be infected with several different types of HPV and have abnormalities picked up on screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While acknowledging limitations to the study, the findings indicate that “women [aged 65 and above] are a high-risk group for cervical cancer incidence and mortality, necessitating urgent attention from countries worldwide”, the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most guidelines suggest stopping screening for those with adequate primary screening and no high-risk factors, particularly for women under 65,” they say. “However, the situation differs for those over 65, who may not have been vaccinated or thoroughly screened. With increasing life expectancy, the risk of cervical cancer in this demographic is significantly heightened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said among people over 65, “there is a largely unvaccinated population who, if under-screened or if they have never attended screening, may well still be at high risk of cervical cancer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We would look to the National Screening Committee to examine the findings and see if there would be benefits in reviewing screening age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxine Lenza, health information manager at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said: “Recent improvements to the test in the UK means it’s an extremely effective way of preventing cervical cancer and saving lives, so those over the age of 65 and up to date with their cervical screening will have a very low risk of developing the disease. However, women over 65 who have never had cervical screening can request a test with their GP practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS cervical screening programme in England follows expert recommendations on age and frequency of screening by the UK National Screening Committee, which are based on regular reviews of the best evidence globally&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Women with an HPV-positive screening result at the age of 65 are invited for additional screening to monitor their ongoing risk and we would encourage all women to attend appointments when invited to ensure they have the best protection against cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “The screening age brackets are based on robust scientific evidence and an expert recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee, however any women who are worried about their symptoms can speak to their GP who will decide the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is vital that we increase the number of women accepting their invitation for cervical cancer screening within the existing age bracket. As part of our 10-year health plan, those who are eligible will be offered convenient human papillomavirus self-sampling kits – breaking down barriers to healthcare as we shift from treatment to prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSzdDXzRCVEtPRmhUTDM5ZXk1T0ZEclh0cVM2U3BZRnR0YmRpcmNYQW5pNHFqUjNDeGNTc0t5bE5KbmxnZFFuSklTbFlrN3JaeU1rc3IxdkRfR0dlSVFPUkliY2pDU2pSck9CRlE2TGdPVUNqQWZndzN1ZXhWdjQ3cHBMNjBtZDNaQ1I0WFlyMXVUUEdwcDlQY2g5VG1hNkE</guid></item><item><title>怀俄明州自2010年以来首次报告麻疹病例- WyoFile | Wyoming reports first measles case since 2010 - WyoFile</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5aNzBfVWlnak8tcDNsdHA5TEhTajQwdVBSVm5XbC05NmJrYXVaSGhCYVl2RlNxaDdVbVRjaTMwWGtTQUw1N2pFMlllcHdwRS12cnF2UHdFWlNKVjlRTnQ1eUU2QWNpTnN1Z2t2a0tlRm5yZG92?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyoming’s first reported measles case since 2010 may have exposed some people at the state’s largest hospital to the highly contagious virus, the Wyoming Department of Health said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed the measles case in an unvaccinated child who lives in Natrona County. It’s unclear how that child was exposed to the virus, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyoming’s first case in 15 years comes amid increasing measles outbreaks nationally and in the Mountain West. All of Wyoming’s neighbors, save for Idaho and Nebraska, have reported cases in the past four weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932"&gt;according to a tally kept by NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The infected Natrona County child visited the emergency department waiting room at Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper on two occasions last week: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on June 24.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;12:55 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. on June 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in that waiting room during those times could have been exposed to measles, the health department reported. State health officials were working with the hospital to notify those individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” State Health Office Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s especially critical for people not vaccinated for the measles, mumps and rubella, commonly known as the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is notably contagious: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Nine out of 10 people near an infected person will become infected themselves&lt;/a&gt; without protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

(Jim Goodson/CDC/Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement to WyoFile, Banner Health confirmed that a patient with measles visited the Casper hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are working closely with state and county health departments to identify those who may have been exposed and take steps to minimize the risk of spread,” the statement read. “Over the past several months, the number of reported cases of measles has increased across the U.S. The health and safety of our team members, patients and visitors remain our highest priority. We will continue to partner with officials at all levels of government and local healthcare to protect and provide the very best care for the communities we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms, which can appear one or two weeks after exposure, include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus can cause serious health complications — especially in kids under 5 years old, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, with two doses preventing measles 97% of the time, Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates, however, have been falling in the United States. The number of school-aged children vaccinated against measles fell from 95% to 92% between 2019 and 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/measles-is-making-a-comeback-can-we-stop-it-202503063091"&gt;according to Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;. Herd immunity for measles &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;requires a 95% vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/vaccine-exemptions-surge-in-wyoming/"&gt;vaccine exemptions have &lt;/a&gt;risen since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Meanwhile, the number of Wyoming kindergartners who received the MMR vaccine has ticked down from 97.5% during the 2012-13 school year to 93.5% in 2023-24, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/data-reports/index.html"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a vaccine skeptic who’s been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html"&gt;criticized for his response to the national outbreak&lt;/a&gt; and for his inconsistent stance on the measles vaccine in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

and 2015 helped researchers compare Parkinson’s patients with a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk was seen in people living one to three miles from a golf course and the expansive

found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in water service areas that included a golf course had nearly double the risk compared to areas without one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk jumped 82% for people living in under water service areas that also had vulnerable groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of PD [Parkinson’s disease] for nearby

regions with vulnerable groundwater based on the bedrock and topography,” lead author Brittany Krzyzanowski, Ph.D told &lt;a

													MEASURES. WE’RE GOING TO TURN TO FIVE ON YOUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW, AND MORE AMERICANS ARE FACING A NEW DANGER AFTER DARK. RESEARCHERS ARE NOW PREDICTING THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEP APNEA COULD DOUBLE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS DOCTOR FAMILIAR FACE. WCVB CHANNEL 5. GOOD TO SEE YOU. TODD CHAIR OF MEDICINE AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH. SO LET’S LET’S START WITH THIS CONDITION. OKAY. ABOUT ABOUT 30 MILLION PEOPLE. IT’S A SIZABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE IT, BUT ONLY 6 MILLION ARE ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED. WHAT MAKES THIS SO HARD TO SPOT? RIGHT I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT. SO 80% OF PEOPLE WITH SLEEP APNEA DON’T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. WHY? FIRST OF ALL, SOME PEOPLE SLEEP ALONE. OBVIOUSLY THEY DON’T HAVE A PARTNER THAT CAN RECOGNIZE YOU’RE STOPPING BREATHING, YOU’RE SNORING SO MUCH. THAT’S ONE REASON. YOU KNOW, ANOTHER REASON IS THAT TO REALLY FORMALLY DIAGNOSE IT, YOU NEED A SLEEP STUDY. NOW, THERE ARE WEARABLE DEVICES THAT ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO SPOT, BUT YOU STILL NEED THAT SLEEP STUDY. AND SOME PEOPLE, SOME OF US THINK WE’RE NOT SLEEPING A LOT, AND WE MAY WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. WE’RE WORKING HARD, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU’RE NOT SLEEPING WELL, IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HEADACHES OR WHAT WE CALL DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE WHERE YOU’RE SLEEPING MORE THAN YOU SHOULD DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT IT. SO SO YOU HAVE READ THIS, THIS STUDY, RIGHT? SO WHAT’S THE LINK TO IS THERE A LINK TO GLOBAL WARMING? RIGHT. THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATION. LOOKED AT OVER 100,000 PEOPLE KIND OF RETROSPECTIVELY, AND SHOWED THAT IN THE PARTS OF THE WORLD, THIS WAS A GLOBAL STUDY. AND THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WERE THE HOTTEST, THERE WAS A 45% INCREASE IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA. 45. THAT’S RIGHT. AND SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE KNOW THAT HOT WEATHER DISRUPTS OUR SLEEP CYCLE. IT LEADS TO SHALLOWER BREATHING. IT LEADS TO MORE FREQUENT AWAKENING. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT REALLY IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY. YOU KNOW, OUR AIRWAY ABILITY. SO OUR RESEARCHERS IN THIS STUDY OFFERING ANY SOLUTIONS THERE ARE. REMEMBER, IF YOU’RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE’S AIR CONDITIONING, THAT HELPS. BUT MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT’S WHY I WANT TO TELL YOU AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH, WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE SLEEP CENTER. WE DO 2000 THIS YEAR. WE’RE PROBABLY ON TRACK TO DO 3000 SLEEP STUDIES PER YEAR. OKAY. IT’S RUN BY A NEUROLOGIST, JAMIE JOHNSTON. SHE’S A WONDERFUL MEDICAL DIRECTOR. IT’S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BRIGHAM. AND I JUST THINK I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, GO AND TRY TO GET A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. BUT IT’S A COMMITMENT. IT’S AN INVESTMENT. IT’S A WORTHY INVESTMENT. REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVE THE REASON YOU’RE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS REFRACTORY TO MEDS. COULD BE SLEEP APNEA. COULD BE OBESITY, CAN BE LINKED TO SLEEP APNEA, WORSENING DIABETES. A LOT OF THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW, IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE MORE ACCIDENTS. SO THERE’S LOTS OF BENEFITS. WOW. ALL THOSE ALL THO

              &lt;p&gt;An immunocompromised woman’s cat stirred up a lot more trouble than usual (for a cat). In a recent case report, doctors detail how the feline likely spread a seldom-seen bacterial infection that landed its owner in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Slovenia wrote the report, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/25-0149_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the June issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 56-year-old woman, a kidney transplant recipient, developed a severe, rare bout of &lt;em&gt;Mycoplasma arginini&lt;/em&gt; infection that was eventually traced back to her cat. Thankfully, the woman’s illness was identified in time for proper treatment, and she ultimately recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman first sought medical care after three weeks of swelling, redness, and pain in her left forearm. Though she was prescribed an oral antibiotic, her condition continued to worsen, and five days later, she was admitted to the hospital. By that point, the swelling and redness had spread to her left wrist, which she was barely able to move. Tests confirmed the infection had spread through the main wrist joint, tendons, and skin surrounding her hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors quickly suspected the woman had some kind of unusual germ in her arm, and testing confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;M. arginini &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Mycoplasma bacteria in general are pretty weird, since they’re incredibly tiny and lack a cell wall (some species can also invade and hide inside our cells to replicate, much like viruses). This lack of a cell wall makes them invulnerable to many conventional antibiotics, likely explaining why the woman’s first treatment failed. The woman also reported that she had recently been bitten by her cat on her left arm.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;With the mystery solved, she was switched to more effective antibiotics. And though she did briefly develop other complications, she and her arm eventually improved enough to be discharged from the hospital. Later follow-up visits confirmed her infection had cleared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; bacteria are commonly found in the respiratory and genital tracts of many animals, pets included. The report authors collected samples from the woman’s three cats and dog. They found some sort of mycoplasma bacteria in one of the cats but couldn’t definitely confirm whether it was &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;. Still, given the recent cat bite and lack of other plausible explanations, the doctors concluded that her cat was the likely source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are some common mycoplasma infections in humans, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mgen/about/index.html"&gt;sexually transmitted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;M.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;genitalium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; isn’t one of them. The doctors were only able to find a handful of other cases documented in the medical literature. And as with this case, most involved people with weakened immune systems. People who receive donated organs need constant immunosuppressing drugs to prevent rejection, and the woman had received two kidney transplants, the latest occurring in 2022. While the average person doesn’t have anything to fear from &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;, doctors treating immunocompromised patients should be aware of its “potential as a pathogen,” the report authors say, especially if their patients are regularly exposed to animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/treatment-for-dog-and-cat-bites-and-scratches"&gt;Cat bites in general&lt;/a&gt; aren’t something to dismiss, since our furry roommates can carry all sorts of germs capable of sickening even the healthiest people. So you should always quickly wash a cat bite or scratch with running water and soap for at least five minutes. You should also keep a close eye out afterward for signs of infection, such as redness and swelling, and see a doctor immediately if they appear (if you’re in poorer health or were bitten by an unfamiliar animal, you should seek medical care regardless, just in case).&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that neurons in both flies and human models of tauopathy accumulate excess glycogen, which disrupts cellular stress management when it can’t be broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) helped redirect sugar metabolism into a protective pathway, reducing oxidative damage and extending lifespan in model organisms. The study also found that dietary restriction and certain drugs can boost GlyP activity, mimicking this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycogen Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in Alzheimer’s models build up excess glycogen, worsening tau-related damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating GlyP reroutes sugar into the PPP, reducing oxidative stress in neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Dietary restriction and drug treatments mimicking it improved brain health in both flies and human neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging has revealed a surprising player in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia: brain sugar metabolism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, the research uncovers how breaking down glycogen—a stored form of glucose—in neurons may protect the brain from toxic protein buildup and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111333"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is typically thought of as a reserve energy source stored in the liver and muscles. While small amounts also exist in the brain, particularly in support cells called astrocytes, its role in neurons has long been dismissed as negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications,” says Professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior scientist on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stored glycogen doesn’t just sit there in the brain; it is involved in pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by postdoc Sudipta Bar, PhD, discovered that in both fly and human models of tauopathy (a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s), neurons accumulate excessive glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this buildup appears to contribute to disease progression. Bar says tau, the infamous protein that clumps into tangles in Alzheimer’s patients, appears to physically bind to glycogen, trapping it and preventing its breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glycogen can’t be broken down, the neurons lose an essential mechanism for managing oxidative stress, a key feature in aging and neurodegeneration. By restoring the activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP)—which kicks off the process of glycogen breakdown—the researchers found they could reduce tau-related damage in fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than using glycogen as a fuel for energy production, these enzyme-supported neurons rerouted the sugar molecules into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)—a critical route for generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and Glutathione, molecules that protect against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies,” said Bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They further mimicked these effects pharmacologically using a molecule called 8-Br-cAMP, showing that the benefits of DR might be reproduced through drug-based activation of this sugar-clearing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work could explain why GLP-1 drugs, now widely used for weight loss, show promise against dementia, potentially by mimicking dietary restriction,” said Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also confirmed similar glycogen accumulation and protective effects of GlyP in human neurons derived from patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), strengthening the potential for translational therapies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says the study emphasizes the power of the fly as a model system in uncovering how metabolic dysregulation impacts neurodegeneration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Work in this simple animal allowed us to move into human neurons in a much more targeted way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi also acknowledges the Buck’s highly collaborative atmosphere as a major factor in the work. His lab, with expertise in fly aging and neurodegeneration, took advantage of proteomics expertise in the Schilling lab and the Seyfried lab (at Emory University) as well as the Ellerby lab which has expertise in human iPSCs and neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says this study not only highlights glycogen metabolism as an unexpected hero in the brain but also opens up a new direction in the search for treatments against Alzheimer’s and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell’s inner chemistry to fight age-related decline,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding—and perhaps rebalancing—our brain’s hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coauthors: &lt;/strong&gt;Additional Buck collaborators include Kenneth A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing a great white shark anywhere on the planet is going to stop your heart for a moment, even if you’re watching it from behind a monitor. &lt;/strong&gt;They move like nothing else in the ocean and have a presence that’s unmatched. Still, watching a shark swim through the waters of a &lt;em&gt;lake &lt;/em&gt;is really going to grab some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, a photographer captured footage of a juvenile great white in Australia’s Lake Conjola. While the shark was awe-inspiring enough for the drone pilot Trent Micallef, it was something he realized while reviewing the footage days later that was most disturbing. Footage clearly shows something white trailing the shark as it moves through the water. He’d assumed in the moment that white tail was a remora fish. But Lake Conjola is a very popular tourist destination for fishermen, and Micallef eventually realized the white flag-looking thing trailing the shark was actually a fishing lure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a shame the effect we can have on them. I would love to have encounters like this more often but if things like this keep happening, we won’t get to have them anymore,” &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/disturbing-discovery-after-great-white-shark-filmed-swimming-in-aussie-lake-050202152.html"&gt;he said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shark scientist in Australia told &lt;em&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/em&gt; this particular juvenile likely found its way into the lake by following the salmon run to Australia’s South Coast and into the lake, pointing out that the migration is a sign of “the ocean working as it should.” Local fishermen had reportedly announced they planned to track the young predator down and catch it, but the shark had found its way out of the lake naturally shortly after Micallef’s footage went viral.&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation protects the body from injury or infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is thought to speed up the ageing process and contribute to various health conditions such as &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/alzheimers-dementia-research-protein-ptau217-b2780235.html"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;disease, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/arthritis-flare-up-symptoms-advice-summer-b2770041.html"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/bulletin/lifestyle/alcohol-smoking-overweight-early-death-b2778438.html"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Researchers have long believed that most older people will suffer from inflammageing as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the study, published in Nature Age this week, found that people in nonindustrialized areas experience inflammation differently than those in urban areas and there may be another cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nature.com%252Farticles%252Fs43587-025-00888-0%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammaging-aging-national-institutes-health-b2780662.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammaging-aging-national-institutes-health-b2780662.html&amp;amp;article_id=2780662&amp;amp;author=Madeline+Sherratt&amp;amp;tag=Inflammation%2Caging%2CHeart+Disease%2CBiology%2CType+2+diabetes&amp;amp;section=Health&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-07-01T19%3A31%3A25.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations - the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia - with two groups from Italy and Singapore. Researchers compared blood samples from about 2,800 adults between 18 and 95 in the four groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that chronic inflammation may not be linked explicitly to ageing, but rather that diet, lifestyle and environmental factors are more significant factors than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that inflammation in the nonindustrialized groups did not appear to increase as subjects got older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cohen, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the study, said the findings suggest inflammation is “more complex than we currently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-49246"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tsimane and Orang Asli differ from us in all these ways,” he told The Independent. “The insight of our study is not to say we need to be more active, but to challenge the idea that we understand biology well and can micromanage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a warning – don’t follow the latest trends of eating foods specifically to reduce inflammation, or whatever else the trend of the week may be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other experts shared a word of caution before jumping to conclusions from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vishwa Deep Dixit, director of the Yale Center for Research on Aging, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; it’s not surprising that people less exposed to pollution would see lower rates of chronic disease. The findings should lead to valuable discussion but would need further study “before we rewrite the inflammaging narrative,” professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Bimal Desai added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxONXdWQ1RkM1BMNTNyckZHel9kUGItelVFMndHYUxabUxCa3NiT3dGYnhna1dWbTB4REtoTklCQ2Zqa1pMUlVoZlhPZG01b1RuaU1PVFJWOWFHc0ZPb0xxcC1tbEZEZUV2dVZhaFFqSDJIMWtHejlTdElGTnpUZHBvUkotMkcwbmFNRkJIQVRqVDR3Qkp0dzZxRVVhVkFRZFNKV0RF</guid></item><item><title>科学家用电击学生的大脑以改善他们的数学学习- Live Science | Scientists zapped students' brains with electricity to improve their math learning - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQSjR2Wnp2SXd5Z19JU1gwbE5LSG9INldRTFQ2NExpSGtEX1NjRG05YzFyeW11VmRyN0JrQXMtcF9vMk5lSVlfdFVVOUVRaHhaVlJ1b0FqdHUyRFFBb2dzUjEzZ0JiR0E4OXN6MmUwVzRySV8tZVlkckRlZW5STndRZlpCMmhlbnpJYUtJWXdrTUJCWVZHMEtJcEI5eVVkbjRxS010XzQ0cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperceptible electrical signals delivered to the brain can improve college students' mathematics skills, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that the technology is not far from being ready for at-home use — though one expert emphasized that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recruited 72 students from the University of Oxford. The researchers assessed the volunteers' &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38936-mathematics.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38936-mathematics.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;math&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prowess with tests before dividing the students into three subgroups with matched abilities, meaning each group had a mix of people with weaker and stronger math skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, individuals in each group had electrodes placed on their scalps that could deliver mild electrical signals to the brain. Two of the groups received stimulation to either the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) — brain areas linked to math ability in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409000402?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409000402?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The third group received a sham stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then applied transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which is just one of many types of non-invasive brain stimulation but is known to be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245710003731?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245710003731?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more comfortable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than other options. The current passed through the scalp is very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the people do not feel whether they're stimulated or not," said senior author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/roi-cohen-kadosh" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/roi-cohen-kadosh" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roi Cohen Kadosh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Surrey. Each participant in the treated groups received 150 minutes of stimulation, paired with math tests, over five days of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/neurons-for-walking-after-spine-injury" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/neurons-for-walking-after-spine-injury"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical zaps can 'reawaken' lost neural connections, helping paralyzed people walk again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pjqXkJZxxKJ8LNsYZA6RP8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pjqXkJZxxKJ8LNsYZA6RP8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests assessed the students' calculation skills and "drill learning." Calculation learning requires existing mathematical ability and challenges participants to work out the answer to a presented problem. Drill learning, in contrast, requires no mathematical ability and instead asks users to memorize a series of presented equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on past research, the authors hypothesized that dlPFC stimulation would enhance calculation learning, because this area is associated with learning new skills and high-level cognition. They thought that stimulating the PPC, meanwhile, which handles the retrieval of already learned skills, might enhance drill learning. In the study, they found dlPFC stimulation was indeed tied to improved calculation ability but PPC stimulation didn't improve drill learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before testing began, the team had measured the connectivity of their participants' frontal and parietal lobes, found at the front and on the top of the brain. These two lobes are the sites of the dlPFC and PPC, respectively, and are activated together during math learning. The team hypothesized that having stronger connections between the two lobes would be linked to stronger calculation learning. This was borne out by the data: at baseline, the team observed a stronger connection in participants with better calculation abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with weaker connectivity who were in the sham stimulation group had a harder time getting to grips with the calculation problems than those with stronger connectivity in the same group. But individuals with weak connections who had their dlPFC stimulated showed the biggest improvements in their scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8954921879204025735&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs41465-019-00126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fzapping-the-brain-may-help-boost-math-skills-study-hints" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-019-00126-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs41465-019-00126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fzapping-the-brain-may-help-boost-math-skills-study-hints" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an earlier, small study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the team undertook with a cohort of math professors showed that stimulation actually worsened the pros' performance on math tests. This suggests those who already have high math ability should avoid stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an optimal system," Kadosh said of the math professors' brains. "You enter new noise into that, it's going to cause a detrimental effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kadosh is the co-founder of Cognite Neurotechnology, a brain stimulation company, and is optimistic about rolling out the technology to the general public. Kadosh said that people in universities, workplaces and training centers could all benefit from it. He added that he was interested in expanding the technology to people with learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=sungjoo" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=sungjoo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sung Joo Kim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist at Binghamton University who was not involved in the research, noted that while similar stimulation devices have already been cleared for at-home use, analyses looking at how well they work have made it clear that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim added that such devices may need to be personalized to individual users to reflect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5539401/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5539401/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;differences in their brain shapes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "When you're targeting to stimulate certain brain regions, it might not necessarily work so well unless you really consider the brain anatomical structure of individual people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kadosh also said that any consumer devices borne of the research need to be anchored to solid evidence, and he argued that many existing consumer brain-stimulation devices have little scientific basis.

The 12-month study found that the drug stabilized psychiatric symptoms, protected against brain damage, and even improved cognition in genetically at-risk participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol boosts an enzyme called GCase, which is often deficient in Parkinson’s patients, contributing to brain cell damage. While not yet approved for use in North America, the drug’s safety profile and early benefits make it a compelling candidate for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilized Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Ambroxol halted psychiatric decline seen in the placebo group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognition improved in those with GBA1 gene variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; GFAP, a marker of brain damage, remained stable on Ambroxol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Lawson Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia poses a major health challenge with no safe, affordable treatments to slow its progression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Lawson Research Institute (Lawson), the research arm of St. Joseph’s Health Care London, are investigating whether Ambroxol – a cough medicine used safely for decades in Europe – can slow dementia in people with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111329"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows an elderly couple." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When this enzyme doesn’t work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published today in the prestigious &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, this 12-month clinical trial involving 55 participants with Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) monitored memory, psychiatric symptoms and GFAP, a blood marker linked to brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease dementia causes memory loss, confusion, hallucinations and mood changes. About half of those diagnosed with Parkinson’s develop dementia within 10 years, profoundly affecting patients, families and the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Cognitive Neurologist Dr. Stephen Pasternak, the study gave one group daily Ambroxol while the other group received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson’s dementia,” says Pasternak. “This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings from the clinical trial include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Ambroxol was safe, well-tolerated and reached therapeutic levels in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Psychiatric symptoms worsened in the placebo group but remained stable in those taking Ambroxol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Participants with high-risk GBA1 gene variants showed improved cognitive performance on Ambroxol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; • A marker of brain cell damage (GFAP) increased in the placebo group but stayed stable with Ambroxol, suggesting potential brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ambroxol is approved in Europe for treating respiratory conditions and has a long-standing safety record – including use at high doses and during pregnancy – it is not approved for any use in Canada or the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current therapies for Parkinson’s disease and dementia address symptoms but do not stop the underlying disease,” explains Pasternak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest Ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol supports a key enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is produced by the GBA1 gene. In people with Parkinson’s disease, GCase levels are often low. When this enzyme doesn’t work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasternak learned about Ambroxol during a fellowship at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, where it was identified as a treatment for Gaucher disease – a rare genetic disorder in children caused by a deficiency of GCase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now applying that research to explore whether boosting GCase with Ambroxol could help protect the brain in Parkinson’s-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is vital because Parkinson’s dementia profoundly affects patients and families,” says Pasternak. “If a drug like Ambroxol can help, it could offer real hope and improve lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the Weston Foundation, this study is an important step toward developing new treatments for Parkinson’s disease and other cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Pasternak and his team plan to start a follow-up clinical trial focused specifically on cognition later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e6828384c8808a878e8394929fa6958c8e85c88a8988828988c88988c88587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Debora Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sjhc.london.on.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lawson Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Debora Flaherty – Lawson Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ambroxol as a Treatment for Parkinson Disease Dementia A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephen Pasternak et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambroxol as a Treatment for Parkinson Disease Dementia A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying a variation in the gene for β-glucocerebrosidase is a major risk factor for Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), and raising β-glucocerebrosidase levels lowers α-synuclein in cell and animals. Ambroxol is a chaperone for β-glucocerebrosidase, which increases the levels of β-glucocerebrosidase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the safety and tolerability of ambroxol in PDD, test the efficacy of ambroxol in improving or slowing the progression of cognitive deficits, and acquire pharmacological data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a 52-week, phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from February 2015 to June 2023. The study took place at a single center and was referral based. Included were patients with PDD who were older than 50 years, had Parkinson disease for at least 1 year before cognitive impairment, had mild to moderate dementia, were taking stable medications, and had a study partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol low dose (525 mg per day), high dose (1050 mg per day), or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and tolerability outcomes were adverse events. Primary efficacy outcomes were the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale, version 13 (ADAS-Cog-13) and Clinician’s Global Impression of Change (CGIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 75 patients were screened, and 55 were randomized. Thirty-one individuals received ambroxol, with 8 patients (mean [SD] age, 78.8 [3.4] years, all male) in the low-dose group and 22 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [7.6]; 19 male [86.4%]) in the high-dose group. One patient was excluded from the high-dose group due to a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 24 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.7 [6.3] years; 19 male [79.2%]) were included in the placebo group. Participants receiving ambroxol (23 of 193 adverse events [12%]) showed more gastrointestinal adverse events than those receiving placebo (9 of 172 adverse events [5%]). Statistical analyses compared ambroxol high dose vs placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence to suggest differences between groups on primary or secondary outcomes. Mean (SD) ambroxol high-dose concentrations were 7.48μM (3.17μM; 95% CI, 6.08-8.87μM) in plasma and 0.73μM (0.07μM; 95% CI, 0.64-0.81μM) in cerebrospinal fluid at the end of titration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean (SD) β-glucocerebrosidase levels were higher at week 26 (ambroxol, 12.45 [1.97] nmol/h/mg; 91% CI, 11.54-13.36 nmol/h/mg); placebo, 8.50 [1.96] nmol/h/mg; 91% CI, 7.65-9.34 nmol/h/mg; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .05) in the ambroxol group compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of this randomized clinical trial reveal that ambroxol was safe, well-tolerated, and demonstrated target engagement.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swiss cheese is blood pressure–friendly thanks to its lower sodium content and excellent calcium offerings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swiss cheese also has unique bioactive peptides that have been shown to lower blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoy Swiss cheese in a hearty salad or pair it with whole-grain crackers or a piece of fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we think of the best foods to help lower blood pressure, dairy usually doesn’t come to mind. But if there’s one &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood pressure–friendly&lt;/a&gt; cheese that experts recommend, it’s Swiss.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swiss cheese, known for its “eyes” (or holes) and mildly sweet and nutty flavor, has healthy properties that might help support better blood pressure levels, says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we dive into the research behind Swiss cheese’s heart-healthy properties, plus how to incorporate the cheese into a balanced diet plan.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on sodium is one of the best ways to help lower your blood pressure. And if cheese is a beloved part of your daily diet, swapping some higher-sodium options for Swiss is a smart way to sustain a balanced and enjoyable eating plan. And it’s not hard to do. Swiss is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961621/the-best-low-sodium-cheeses-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowest-sodium cheese&lt;/a&gt; options out there, says Gaw. A 1-ounce serving of Swiss cheese contains about 52 milligrams of sodium, or 2% of the Daily Value. Compare that to 1 ounce of Cheddar, which has about 185 mg, or 8% of the DV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dairy is often associated with &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; heart issues, research shows that calcium in dairy foods such as Swiss cheese does not increase blood pressure or risk for hypertension, says Gaw: “In fact, it may reduce the risk of stroke.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swiss cheese is a stellar source of calcium—1 ounce provides about 20% of the DV. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know protein helps keep you satiated and supports &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-protein-to-increase-muscle-mass-11720169" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, but research suggests that the protein in cheese is also a good source of bioactive peptides, which may benefit blood pressure. Swiss cheese, specifically, contains two peptides—Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro—that have been shown to have anti-hypertensive effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research needs to be done to nail down the amount of cheese it takes to reap these health benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swiss is delicious as a standalone snack, and it’s just as great paired with other foods or in recipes. Here are a few tasty ways to enjoy Swiss:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw recommends pairing a slice of Swiss cheese with fruit for a low-sodium snack. Any fruit works, but we especially like apples for the flavor combo. “This snack is also good for blood pressure and blood sugar, thanks to its dose of calcium, protein, potassium and fiber,” Gaw says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it in a sandwich:&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw recommends stacking a grilled chicken sandwich with a slice of Swiss cheese, lettuce and slices of tomatoes and avocado. “This snack can be part of the Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-dash-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11738768" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)&lt;/a&gt; dietary patterns, which help lower blood pressure,” adds Gaw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add it to a salad:&lt;/strong&gt; Swiss adds protein and calcium, plus umami flavor, to a bowl of greens. Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258450/green-goddess-salad-with-chickpeas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Green Goddess Salad with Chickpeas recipe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with crackers:&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw recommends pairing Swiss cheese with whole-grain crackers for an energy boost that promotes blood sugar and blood pressure management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swapping out high-sodium cheeses for Swiss can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your sodium intake&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some other ways to help support healthier blood pressure levels:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use herbs and spices:&lt;/strong&gt; Lean on garlic, ginger, basil and oregano instead of salt to lower sodium intake and reduce blood pressure, says Gaw. A review found that garlic is associated with reduced blood pressure and cholesterol in those with and without chronic high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more plants:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-forward eating patterns, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-hypertension-11751158" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and DASH diet, can help to lower blood pressure, adds Gaw. Research shows these diets are more promising for lowering blood pressure than just salt restriction alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut back on alcohol: &lt;/strong&gt;Drinking too much (which means more than two drinks a day for men and more than one drink a day for women) can spike your blood pressure. Cutting back on wine, beer, liquor and other alcohol can help lower your numbers and support your overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding an exercise you love can help you move more and, therefore, lower your blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; at least two days a week and 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity cardio each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swiss cheese is significantly lower in sodium than many other cheeses, and eating less sodium can help lower blood pressure. Swiss is an excellent source of calcium and has unique bioactive peptides (found in the proteins), which research suggests may also help lower your blood pressure. Adding Swiss to a hearty salad or pairing it with high-fiber fruit and crackers is a smart way to enjoy this nutritious dairy snack.&lt;br&gt;

That’s when an ultrasound discovered the devastating news — which Bowler was told while he was driving to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He asked if I was sitting down. I told him I was driving, and he asked me to pull over,” he said, adding that’s when “I knew it was bad news. He said they suspected cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor, he said, was &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-of-4-stage-4-melanoma-under-fingernail-spreads-to-brain-8779683" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:melanoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; — the most lethal form of skin cancer. While skin cancer is the “most common type of cancer” in the U.S., according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; melanoma accounts for only about 1% of cases. Still, it “causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Bowler / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Simon Bowler shares a photo while undergoing treatment for invasive skin cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, he underwent a successful surgery to remove the tumors and began a yearlong course of &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. But nine months later, Bowler says he knew something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms he had experienced when the lump was first discovered returned, he explained: “To be honest, I didn't feel right in my head. I started having blurred vision again, and I couldn't switch off at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer had &lt;a href="https://people.com/teddi-mellencamp-sobbing-extreme-pain-brain-tumor-diagnosis-11696738" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread to his brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spread to his brain&lt;/a&gt; — or as he said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/simon-bowler-the-start-of-my-journey-and-only-17-months-in" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;, “I had 2 minuscule melanoma cells in my brain. The consultants reassured me that following my neck procedure this was not uncommon,” and the treatment prescribed was targeted radiation to “zap it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in March 2025, Bowler struggled with the treatment, having a severe gastrointestinal reaction that caused him to be hospitalized for 10 days. While there, he had an adverse reaction to steroids, which caused nerve damage to his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt numb, battered. It was like I'd been hit by a truck. I've got wobbly legs now and a right hand that can barely grip a racket, let alone type. But I'm still trying,” said Bowler, who shared that he's thankful for the support of his wife, Tracey. “That hospital stay nearly broke me. When I got home, I'd just burst into tears for days. It stripped away everything that felt like me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Bowler / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Simon Bowler with his wife, Tracey.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with paying for treatment, the GoFundMe is intended to help Bowler launch a company that makes tennis accessories, as he’s struggling to work. “With my physicalities as they are, a successful lesson is me not falling over,” he explained in the fundraiser, which is also donating to mental health and cancer charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, “It's OK to cry. It's OK to admit you're not OK. I've been stripped of a lot of my identity — but I haven't lost my will to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just want to get back to helping people, mentoring young players, and showing them what resilience looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/tennis-pro-gets-intoxicated-after-one-drink-lethal-sign-11764264" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:19:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFA0WEREZmVMNzVJVzBWdTZWcXZ2QlZpSUlta3gyTW9BVHBSUHNTc0xlTkVNUy1Oa3ZvUUV3LXB2Uzl4Y0JNWWF6VzZDZGkwRlZLd2d3eWRnNnpYaE5WOGdfbnl5NEgzVGIyXzYwSzBHaUtwbVJl</guid></item><item><title>迷走神经信号对较高社会经济群体的食物摄入量影响更大- PsyPost | Vagus nerve signals influence food intake more in higher socio-economic groups - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMG1iWHNpQzVnM3BoYU5LcHBwSk00VG1CbE9vbEJ2aXJQTUpEYzRhdFpVNEdlNG93WjlucERpdUEtWjlXelFSUmZmVzRJME82Y3pQeEdQc0Uzd1VGcDlPU0xvUVBlb3pKb1FfZkhVZDdxR0tVX3AyYUJhR0RQeXV1ZHZrYXFkTVV1dzlUc3VPbWdoZEpHbXJMQmJIa0hCY0pTVGV6ekVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2025.105491" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Food Quality and Preference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the way our bodies signal hunger and fullness might be shaped by our socio-economic background. Researchers found that signals from the vagus nerve—an important biological pathway connecting the gut and brain—were more strongly linked to food consumption in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Individuals from lower socio-economic groups, on the other hand, appeared less influenced by these internal cues when deciding how much to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting information between the gut and brain. It helps regulate digestion, appetite, and emotional responses to stress. A common way to assess vagal activity is by measuring heart rate variability, or HRV, which reflects how flexibly the body adjusts its heart rate. Higher HRV tends to be associated with better self-regulation and emotional control, including the ability to resist impulses like overeating. Researchers have long theorized that physiological self-regulation, like that provided by vagal tone, plays an important role in eating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study was designed to test how vagal tone might interact with socio-economic status to shape eating habits. To do this, the researchers focused on a very specific behavior: chocolate consumption. Chocolate is a high-fat, high-sugar food known to trigger cravings and emotional eating, making it a good model for studying self-regulation. The study included 96 university students in the United Kingdom who came from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess participants’ socio-economic status, the researchers used two approaches. First, they asked students to report their perceived status compared to other students. Second, they recorded the highest level of education achieved by each participant’s parent or guardian. This two-pronged approach allowed them to capture both subjective and objective aspects of socio-economic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the lab, participants were fitted with sensors to record their heart activity. The researchers collected HRV data during a rest period and also during two tasks designed to cause mild stress. One task involved mentally subtracting sevens from a large number under time pressure, while the other required participants to give a short speech about what it would be like to die from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these tasks, participants entered a relaxation phase and then took part in a “taste test” that was, in fact, the key measure of eating behavior. They were left alone with a plate of 70 milk chocolate droplets and told they could eat as many as they liked while evaluating the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main question was whether participants’ vagal tone, as measured through HRV, would predict how much chocolate they ate—and whether this relationship would be different depending on their socio-economic status. The researchers tested three possible patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First was the “blunting” hypothesis: that people from lower socio-economic backgrounds might have lower baseline HRV, leading to less effective self-regulation and more eating. Second was the “hyperreactivity” hypothesis: that stress would trigger stronger physiological responses (such as vagal withdrawal) in low-SES individuals, leading to more eating. Third was the “dissociation” hypothesis: that internal physiological signals (like vagal tone) might only guide behavior among higher-SES individuals, while lower-SES individuals would show weaker alignment between those signals and their eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results did not support the first two ideas. There was no significant relationship between socio-economic status and baseline vagal tone, and vagal tone alone did not predict how much chocolate participants consumed. Similarly, there was little evidence that stress responses (vagal withdrawal) were higher in low-SES individuals or that such responses predicted more eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the third hypothesis—the dissociation hypothesis—was supported. Among participants from higher socio-economic backgrounds, higher baseline vagal tone was linked to eating fewer chocolates. This suggests that in these individuals, the body’s internal regulation systems were more closely aligned with their eating behavior. In contrast, among those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, there was no significant link between vagal tone and chocolate consumption. Even though their bodies may have sent signals of satiety or restraint, those signals did not appear to influence how much they ate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns held even after accounting for factors like hunger, body mass index, how much participants liked the chocolate, and whether they were actively trying to restrict their food intake. The researchers also repeated the analyses using slightly different methods and found consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dissociation between physiological signals and behavior may help explain why people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more vulnerable to overconsumption in environments filled with processed, high-calorie foods. If internal signals are less likely to influence behavior, external cues like portion size, advertising, and emotional triggers may play a larger role. This could lead to patterns of eating that are less in tune with actual energy needs, contributing over time to health problems such as obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation for this dissociation may be differences in early life stress. People who grow up in unpredictable or unsafe environments—conditions more common in low-income households—may develop habits that favor immediate rewards over internal regulation. Other research has shown that early life adversity can reduce what scientists call “interoceptive sensitivity,” or the ability to detect and respond to internal bodily signals like hunger and fullness. Over time, this might impair the brain’s ability to use physiological signals to guide eating decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that while the vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting signals between the gut and the brain, the extent to which these signals guide eating behaviour can vary with one’s socio-economic status,” the study’s lead author, Mario Weick of Durham University, explained. Our research indicates that internal signals may be more closely aligned with eating behaviour in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. In contrast, those from lower socio-economic groups appear to show a weaker link between these physiological signals and their food consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations. It focused only on chocolate consumption and included a relatively young, university-based sample. Future research will need to determine whether these findings extend to other kinds of food, different types of stress, or more diverse populations. The researchers also acknowledge that their design does not prove causation—it cannot definitively say whether socio-economic status causes changes in vagal regulation or whether other variables are at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Milica Vasiljevic emphasized that the study should not be interpreted as blaming individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds. “Our study does not support the idea that individuals from lower socio-economic groups eat more or are inherently more impulsive,” she said. “Rather, it highlights that the internal regulation of eating – how our bodies naturally signal when to eat and when to stop – may function differently depending on our socio-economic backgrounds. This could have important implications for understanding broader health inequalities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies might explore whether practices like mindfulness, yoga, or biofeedback can help boost vagal tone and interoceptive sensitivity, especially in disadvantaged groups. If so, such interventions could offer a promising way to support healthier eating habits from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2025.105491" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Socio-economic status modulates the link between vagal tone and chocolate consumption&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Mario Weick and Milica Vasiljevic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:15:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMG1iWHNpQzVnM3BoYU5LcHBwSk00VG1CbE9vbEJ2aXJQTUpEYzRhdFpVNEdlNG93WjlucERpdUEtWjlXelFSUmZmVzRJME82Y3pQeEdQc0Uzd1VGcDlPU0xvUVBlb3pKb1FfZkhVZDdxR0tVX3AyYUJhR0RQeXV1ZHZrYXFkTVV1dzlUc3VPbWdoZEpHbXJMQmJIa0hCY0pTVGV6ekVR</guid></item><item><title>气候变化正在改变传染病的地理位置--法国24 | Climate change is changing the geography of infectious disease - France 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxObTFCZ0tEaE9BR0ZNM1NfNmpKZ3hFY1dteUhWcEMyN1N4ZDZqdnF1YUNzajhSVjBnbjJOM0pqWmVnajdtUHNyd3hGLXQxUGVsUXJIWFBKbVZYbnd6VGp5WEtxUEVpV2FodU03dUdWZkpUSmhpaGtHVWdZSFZ0Mi1KaVZ0bndMamk3ZUVWSE5ydHB2TjNaa0pXbUhZQUVNZGVYaU4zbU85SXp0aXBuckt6RFJ0c09ILVlyd251aU40YmRSTDA4aFV1UUc5OA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="a-loader-error__content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASPER, Wyo. — The Wyoming Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated child from Natrona County. This case is the first reported in Wyoming since 2010.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was in the Banner Wyoming Medical Center Emergency Department Waiting Room while infectious on June 24 from roughly 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and on June 25 from 12:55 to 2:55 p.m. People in the location at those times were possibly exposed to measles. The WDH reports that it is working with Banner Wyoming Medical Center to notify these individuals.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” WDH state health officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said.






&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the child’s measles exposure was not identified.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious infection that can cause severe illness. People exposed to measles typically develop symptoms seven to 21 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, coughing, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash that usually starts several days later on the face and spreads down the body.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have received the MMR vaccine or were born before 1957 are generally considered immune.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjijo00123b760qx6zt7s@published"&gt;My boyfriend wants to be pegged. I am usually pretty open to trying things, but for some reason, this is a hard no for me. The thought actively turns me off. My boyfriend is having a hard time accepting my hard no because so far I haven’t turned him down for anything else. How do I get it through his stubborn head that this is not going to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those moments that tells you something important about who you’re dating. Are they able to hear you saying, “No” and accept that? Or are they going to push, wheedle, and whine until they break down your resolve? And, for the record, engaging in acts that are a hard no for you (for whatever reason) strikes me as going beyond &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/good-giving-game-research-confirms-dan-savages-sex-advice-works/"&gt;good, giving, and game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From there, you’ll have to decide whether you want to leave the relationship. You do get to choose your path forward here. Go ahead and weigh what you get out of the relationship and how important it is to you. Consider whether your boyfriend’s stubbornness has caused difficulties in other areas, and whether there have been other instances—maybe outside of your sex lives—where he’s steamrolled your boundaries or even preferences. Once you’ve thought through the whole dynamic, a single ultimatum is worth a try. Something along the lines of, “I’ve said this is a hard limit for me on multiple occasions, and if you continue to pursue this, I will end our relationship” should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjted001j3b7670gxlnzy@published"&gt;My wife, a 33-year-old woman, and I, a 36-year-old man, got married six months ago after a three-year dating period. It’s the best choice I’ve ever made in my life, and she’s the light of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtee001k3b76xd5lslbu@published"&gt;She was always a little concerned about her body image. Before the wedding, it got more intense as she went on a big kick to get herself thin for the “perfect” wedding dress. She looked amazing, and I did my best to support her in that process. After the wedding, during the honeymoon, and after, she stopped counting calories for the first time since I got to know her. As a result, she’s easily put on maybe 30 to 40 pounds, and I cannot tell you how much I’ve enjoyed this process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckr891f00603b76qxg975jp@published"&gt;Eating dinner and splitting desserts with her has made dinners more fun, getting drunk-ish with her a couple of times a month has been a shared joy, and she’s been more inclined to let loose. If I’m honest, she looks better for it. She still eats a healthy balance of foods, and she hasn’t stopped exercising, but she doesn’t do either of those things with the fanatic attention or self-starving ethos she once had (and maybe concerns me in retrospect). She’s still the woman I fell in love with and wanted to marry, but more carefree, less on-edge, and simply happier.&lt;/p&gt;

When I’ve tried to bring up her change in mood, it gets shut down by her getting concerned about the appearance of her thighs or other parts of her body. Every time I try to be positive about her body, she will immediately start nitpicking and almost spiraling. On one hand, I love this woman and will support her in just about any choice she makes about her appearance that isn’t harmful to her health, and know that her relationship to self-image isn’t one I can internalize but one I can empathize with and find pathways to be supportive of. On the other, I want to share my perspective that she’s the happiest, most relaxed, and sexiest version of her that I’ve known. Any ideas on how to approach this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtei001o3b76onkr2atd@published"&gt;In your letter, you describe giving your wife compliments on her body, and also bringing up these recent changes to her mood. She might be receiving the latter as criticism of her mood and behavior in those previous moments. If you haven’t tried this yet, you might lead with something closer to what you wrote in your second-to-last line—plainly and simply stating what you appreciate about her mood at this time, and avoiding comparisons to previous times. Stay entirely focused on her demeanor and the way you perceive her level of happiness. I want to caution you to remember that we can state our perspectives, but we can’t guarantee that the person we’re expressing ourselves to will hear, much less internalize, what we’re saying to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtek001p3b76iy4zweum@published"&gt;Your wife, like many others who are unhappy with their bodies, has responded to your physically-driven compliments with self-criticism, so I’d steer clear of those for a while. And framing positive feedback about her current state in terms of improvement over the past could be landing as negativity, crucially, about what she feels she has to do to have the body she prefers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtek001q3b76m3q0edu9@published"&gt;You’re absolutely correct that her body and her relationship to self-image are hers to sort through or change if she desires. Shoring up the self-esteem of our loved ones is often romanticized, but in reality, there’s little we can do to instill in them a sense of satisfaction around something they’re sensitive about. If you’re looking for ways to be supportive, get curious about why a certain weight or shape means so much to her. Ask her how important being happy is, what gives her feelings of happiness, what “relaxed” means to her, and how much she values that, too. From there, you might understand more about where she’s coming from or be able to support her happiness and relaxation in areas other than her relationship to her body.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, it’s great to work with members of any group we’re a part of to understand moments where feelings were hurt and decide how to navigate them. Also, though, without knowing Ron’s status for various STIs, you don’t know what Becca is being exposed to and therefore may be bringing into the group.&lt;/p&gt;

If there wasn’t, whoever Bailey is closest to in the group can simply reach out for a cozy, private chat and ask what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t really understand why it’s stuck there. We work together for our small business and have colleagues in common. At a recent work lunch, these colleagues were regaling the table with a story about my wife at a client dinner they all went to at a conference. I wasn’t there. They talked about how she had a lot to drink and was so much fun and—&lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/wife-discovery-sex-advice.html"&gt;here’s the sticky part for me…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But sometimes, these seemingly banal experiences signal something more serious, like an infection, blood disorder, or autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms aren’t waning—or your gut is telling you something just isn’t right—it may be worth talking to your doctor. Ahead, learn more about 20 everyday symptoms that may be signs of a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bloodshot Eyes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons you might have bloodshot eyes. According to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14908-cory-fisher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cory Fisher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cory Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a family medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic, red eyes are often caused by conjunctivitis (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26391702/pink-eye-or-allergies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pink eye;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pink eye&lt;/a&gt;)—an infection involving common &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a22498824/cold-vs-flu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, like a runny nose, sore throat, and cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if your bloodshot eyes aren’t going away, you might have a bigger problem. “If the red eyes are prolonged—longer than a week or so—or come with pain or vision changes, it may indicate something more serious, like a deeper infection of the eye or glaucoma,” he says. Glaucoma is a serious condition that can cause vision loss and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;DawnPoland - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smelly Vaginal Discharge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking care of your vaginal health is incredibly important for your well-being. Case in point? Having foul-smelling discharge could actually be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection of your reproductive organs that’s usually caused by a sexually transmitted disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an STD—like gonorrhea or chlamydia—isn’t properly treated, the infection can spread and cause chronic pain and infertility, in addition to abnormal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin Rashes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin rashes can certainly mean nothing. Maybe your skin was just exposed to an allergen or is too dry and needs some lotion, says Dr. Fisher. But they can also be an early symptom of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Occasionally, a skin rash can be part of a more significant disease process. Be more concerned if the rash is painful, spreading rapidly, or not responding to initial treatments,” he explains. “Many disease states can present with a rash, including some infections, hematologic diseases, or connective tissue disorders, like lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;chokja - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dry Mouth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, there may be an easy fix: Hydrate. But if lack of fluids isn’t the issue, another possibility is Sjogren’s syndrome—an autoimmune disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth, among other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s possible to develop the syndrome at any age, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fsjogrens-syndrome%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20353216&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-conditions%2Fg65224049%2Feveryday-symptoms-serious-disease%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says it’s more common in women over 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Portra - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excessive Sweating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sweating could be the result of a common disorder called hyperhidrosis, which affects around 3% of the population.

But if you’re constantly craving ice, that could be a sign of pica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pica is a disorder where you have an appetite for items people wouldn’t normally consider food—like dirt, paper, and chalk, which have no nutritional value.

If it’s been looking cloudy instead of its healthy clear or light yellow shade, Dr. Fisher says it could be due to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, if you increase your fluid intake and it’s still cloudy or if you have any other symptoms like blood in the urine, pain with urination, or abdominal discomfort, you should call your doctor,” he explains.

But if your bowel movements have become urgent and often—causing you to have diarrhea multiple times a day—it could be a sign of ulcerative colitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease causes the large intestine to become inflamed and develop ulcers.
