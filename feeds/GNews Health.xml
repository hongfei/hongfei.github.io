    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33ilpe003y26qm1aeqe1xr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest data on respiratory illness in the United States shows that shoppers and merry-makers are spreading more than just holiday cheer: They’re also passing around germs. In many cases, it’s a new virus variant that’s been causing early and busy flu seasons in Asia, Australia and Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhv800022e6fausk9ref@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US is on the cusp of finding out what this flu variant, called subclade K, will do. For the week ending December 6 — the first full week after the Thanksgiving holiday — the proportion of doctor’s visits for symptoms including fever plus a cough or sore throat rose to 3.2%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj38e0qq001j3b6s15q1af21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s above a national baseline that infectious disease experts call the epidemic threshold. It’s a signal that flu season is officially underway, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, who directs the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00032e6fmhaek46s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are two ways to gauge the start of flu season, said Rivers, who has been closely tracking cases. By the calendar, it’s week 40, around the first week in October – but that date doesn’t necessarily mean flu is spreading widely.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00042e6fg89zbl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Going by flu activity, “the 3.1% threshold marks the onset of flu season,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00052e6fyrp7f51o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest CDC update&lt;/a&gt;, at least 14 public health jurisdictions are showing moderate to high flu activity, mostly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concentrated in the Northeast. These include New York City, where activity is very high; New York and New Jersey, where it’s high; and Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which are in the moderate category. Flu activity is also high in Louisiana and Colorado. Other states and territories showing upticks are Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico and Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388e1e000y3b6s1d9rbzk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week also saw the season’s first reported death of a child from the flu in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37hcy600023b6sakn8c8ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that from our surveillance, influenza activity is increasing in the US right now, and therefore that the time to get vaccinated for this season is right now,” said Dr. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer of the CDC’s influenza division, said on a call with doctors this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00062e6fda4bpzph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are signs that this season could be a bad one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00072e6flys3qmmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In New York state, flu cases began rising about two weeks earlier than usual, said Dr. James McDonald, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, which keeps its own flu data,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;separate from the CDC’s. Flu hospitalizations have doubled each week for the past two weeks, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00082e6fz7fp1oi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s here, and it announced itself quite loudly,” McDonald said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00092e6fmxx2no71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plotted on a graph, McDonald says, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/respiratory_viruses/activity/2025-2026/docs/current_respiratory_report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the curve is J-shaped&lt;/a&gt;, indicating a rapid rise in severe cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj39pi1000013b6sgs49gmj9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not common where you see a curve that goes like that,” he added. “What that means is, you’re seeing more people end up in a hospital quicker compared to last year. And we’re seeing more people get diagnosed with flu than last year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000b2e6f52m8yzy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state Department of Health sent an alert to hospitals on Monday, flagging the quick rise in cases and urging them to subtype specimens and take proper infection control measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37qify00083b6s7c8mbmu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The majority of flu viruses collected and analyzed by American laboratories during this respiratory virus season have been subclade K, a variant of a flu strain called H3N2, which itself is a variety of influenza A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000d2e6f17bcz8ad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seasons during which influenza A(H3) causes the majority of influenza infections are typically characterized by more severe illness, particularly among older adults, resulting in more persons seeking care,” the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;New York alert said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj382uyw000u3b6s7ucbuei2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other countries including Japan, China, the UK and Canada have also reported busy flu seasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00103b6smgb2qugf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Australia, where subclade K was first detected, there were nearly half a million confirmed flu cases, smashing the record set just the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00113b6se50pbisn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists often look to Australia, where flu season hits between April and October — winter in the Southern Hemisphere — for clues as to what could be coming to countries in the Northern Hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00123b6skev7sr74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, there’s an old joke public health veterans tell about the unpredictability of flu season: “If you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season.” Some experts caution that the US may not see the kind of activity as in other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00133b6s3rql0ckb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had a really bad flu season last year, and whether that means we will have a bad flu season this year, it’s hard to say,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00143b6s9h5mdhui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not typical that you have two back-to-back bad flu seasons,” Nuzzo said. “I have wondered if perhaps we might be somewhat more protected than some of these other countries because of what happened in the US last year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00153b6s81h7qbyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But with a new variant in the mix, the old patterns may not hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00163b6s0w0xzayt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s going to be a pretty bad flu season,” said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. Canada too has seen an early and brisk start to its flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00173b6sw7tp14m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was supposed to actually be on a call right now, but the person who was supposed to be on the call with got the flu. School is closed, and their whole family has it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37sddk000c3b6s2hx130oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new variant wasn’t included in this year’s flu shots because it was identified after scientists had chosen the four strains to include this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000f2e6fj3k0tz0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu shots contain related strains, though, and they seem to be working pretty well against this variant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj39tppq00073b6slog3bu97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;recent look&lt;/a&gt; at the efficacy of flu vaccines in the United Kingdom by scientists with the UK’s Health Security Agency found that even though antibodies generated by this year’s shots didn’t neutralize subclade K viruses as effectively as other strains, the vaccines still cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization for the H3N2 strains, which were dominated by subclade K, by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness was lower for adults, including those over 65. This years vaccines cut the odds of needing to go to the ER or hospital for the flu by about 30% to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000g2e6f2xmoixgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although that’s hopeful, it doesn’t mean the US will see the same results. Because of differences in how the vaccines are made, protection may not be as strong.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000h2e6fzhzxubs3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope that what the UK is seeing in the early season data is what we can expect, but they mostly use cell-based vaccine, and we mostly use egg-based vaccine. A little worried that we’re not going to see that level of performance,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000l2e6fc1ftlcad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even with the flu shots’ limitations, any protection is better than no protection, said Dr. Alex Greninger, who is head of infectious disease diagnostics in the University of Washington’s Department of Laboratory Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000m2e6f5mvvpkin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It takes about seven days for vaccines to take full effect in the body. With flu season well underway, Greninger said, it’s best not to wait if you haven’t gotten this year’s vaccine yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000n2e6fqqfomleq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you get vaccinated today, that thing will be home by Christmas in terms of your immune system,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000o2e6f1a6e7pj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The protection from flu shots is especially important for kids, who’ve had less exposure to influenza than adults and therefore have less natural immunity against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000p2e6f4rt0mn8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bigger deal to have gotten your vaccine than to have not gotten your vaccine when you’re a kid,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000q2e6f9zlo8xk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination data&lt;/a&gt; collected by the CDC shows that just 38% of kids have gotten a flu shot this year, lower than at the same point for the previous six seasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000r2e6f8m99y0d1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US &lt;a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/news/us-influenza-vaccination-gaps-linked-to-record-pediatric-deaths-from-2024-to-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;set a record&lt;/a&gt; in child deaths from the flu last season. At least 280 kids died of influenza last fall and winter, the most deaths in a non-pandemic year since data was first collected in 2004. In cases where vaccination status was known, nearly 9 in 10 were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00112e6ffwbbljlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu shots don’t keep people from getting infected. But getting vaccinated is the best way to cut the odds that you’ll need to see a doctor or be hospitalized if you do get the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00122e6fzbkmqr3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They also don’t completely prevent transmission — passing the flu virus to someone else if you are sick — but they do reduce the chances of that happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00132e6futt38dq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because flu shots aren’t perfect, it’s a good idea to take more than one precaution to avoid getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00142e6f5he0jddu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rivers, from Johns Hopkins, says she gets a flu shot every year and then watches the data. When infections start to go up, “by the holidays, for sure, I am wearing a mask in crowded places, like the airport,” she said. She also tries to avoid high-risk settings “like those indoor trampoline places my kids love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00152e6foq5whown@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re in a place where you can’t mask, such as eating dinner around a holiday table, opening a window and bringing in fresh air or using an air purifier can help keep people from getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00162e6fk0tmwkjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, there’s a cost. You know, we’re all thinking about our heating bill these days, but it’s an intervention that I think is always useful. It’s particularly useful when it’s not practical or it’s not desirable to wear a mask,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37vd4z000j3b6se1suwks5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu hits hard. Symptoms including a high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and chills tend to appear all at once rather than gradually.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj3817ub000m3b6sfcra0oxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you get sick, it’s a good idea to get tested since there are antiviral medications that can reduce the length and severity of illness if you start them within the first 48 hours of the illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

found that hospitalizations for eating disorders in male patients had risen dramatically since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s more awareness around eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia can be overlooked for several reasons ― one reason being that it can lead to behaviors often encouraged in the weight room,” Gooding said. “Lack of awareness of the disorder may lead to the disorder being missed in someone who is struggling, as this is one of the less well-known disorders. Those who struggle may hesitate to reach out for help due to shame, secrecy or the normalization of the behaviors in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SolStock via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SolStock via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Social media has become a dangerous influence on young people's body image and self-esteem. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s fueling the rise of bigorexia in kids and young adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many potential causes and influences, including biological, psychological and sociocultural factors that can contribute to the development of this disorder,” Becker said. “A family history of mental health conditions, especially disorders related to body image or anxiety, may increase the chance of developing bigorexia. Likewise, people with low self-esteem, perfectionism or obsessive-compulsive tendencies are more vulnerable to developing this disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma and bullying are potential risk factors for bigorexia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bodybuilders and other people who lift weights are at a higher risk than the general population,” Nagata said. “Competitive athletes are more at risk than noncompetitive athletes. Athletes who lift weights to change the appearance of their bodies are at higher risk than those who focused on improving performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke to HuffPost agreed that one of the biggest factors contributing to the rise of bigorexia is the proliferation of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only are young people consuming body ideals from the media, but they feel pressure to produce content and display their own bodies on social media,” Nagata said. “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. Constant comparisons to these idealized bodies may lead to body dissatisfaction and bigorexia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overemphasis on an idealized physical appearance in media and advertising is particularly harmful for younger boys, who might not fully appreciate that influencers and celebrities actually make their livelihood off images of their bodies. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a different reality" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693ae4fae4b053d6e8efce25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;a different reality&lt;/a&gt; that is unattainable (not to mention undesirable) for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TikTokers and other social media influencers are making millions of dollars by getting likes and followers, which they then invest in professional trainers, full-time chefs, and other experts to curate and maintain their image,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joseph J.

Trunzo&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor and associate director of the School of Health &amp;amp; Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to celebrities such as Hugh Jackman, who has trained for hours a day and even undergone &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/bodybuilders-dehydrate-before-competition-techniques-hugh-jackman-reddit" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="supervised dehydration regimens" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693ae4fae4b053d6e8efce25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/bodybuilders-dehydrate-before-competition-techniques-hugh-jackman-reddit" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;supervised dehydration regimens&lt;/a&gt; to transform his body for screen roles. “Most 15-year-old kids” do not think about these facts when they see images of Jackman looking ripped and instead might develop dissatisfaction with their own bodies, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s not even taking into consideration the misleading role of filters, angles, poses, makeup and editing in those images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Influencers may take thousands of images and pick the best one, with the best lighting or enhancements, to curate the ideal version of themselves,” Trunzo added. “None of it is real. In short, we are constantly exposed to unrealistic, idealized and glamorized versions of the human body at a rate that we have never experienced before. In the hands of an impressionable young person, this is a very dangerous dynamic and recipe for psychological disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment sections also expose posters and viewers to harsh critiques about people’s bodies, which can fuel more insecurity and low self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those struggling with muscle dysmorphia, seeing pictures and messaging on social media may cause a person to have harmful thoughts about the need to change their body,” Gooding said. “They may start to train more in the gym and worry about losing body fat to enhance their muscular bodies. Soon this training becomes excessive and obsessive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can parents do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways parents can help counteract the forces that fuel body image issues and psychological disorders like bigorexia. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limit social media consumption as much as possible, but recognize that you cannot eliminate it altogether,” Trunzo advised. “Your child will be exposed to these images, so talk to them about what they are seeing. Listen to what they say, how they interpret what they see, make sure they understand the reality behind what they are viewing and are not ‘buying’ the image.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended emphasizing values of human worth and dignity that go beyond physical appearance. Focus on qualities like kindness, creativity, humor, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to provide support by creating a safe space for open conversations,” Becker said. “Be a positive role model by demonstrating a healthy attitude toward your own body and self-esteem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the comments you make about your own bodies in front of your children and the attitudes toward exercise and food you’re displaying. Be mindful of the kinds of messages your kids are getting from their entertainment and social media activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents should challenge unhealthy and unhelpful messaging about ‘perfect bodies’ and social acceptance,” Gooding advised. “Body diversity should be discussed and praised. Conversations surrounding exercise should include messages about proper fueling, refueling, rest and balance in workouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When images of buff celebrities appear on your child’s radar, provide context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been having conversations with my 9-year-old son like, ‘Let’s read what Hugh Jackman said about what he had to do to transform into Wolverine and look like this,’” said therapist &lt;a href="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cherie Miller" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693ae4fae4b053d6e8efce25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Cherie Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who is CEO and clinical director at Nourished Soul Center for Healing. “It’s a chance to say, ‘You know, this isn’t normal, this isn’t realistic, and this is not something that we should try to attain.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focuses “body respect” ― reminding her children that we care about our bodies and want to take care of them, so we do things like drinking enough water, getting enough sleep and eating a variety of foods. The goal is to avoid extremes and know that bodies are great because of the functions they serve in helping us live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Talking about body diversity as a good and natural thing is important too,” Miller said. “Life would be boring if we all looked the same. So isn’t it great that we come at all sizes and shapes and colors.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium and vitamin D are both essential nutrients for maintaining strong, healthy bones. And while each plays a different role in bone health, experts say they work better when taken together.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/supplements-for-bone-health-8781770" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mineral that gives bones their structure and strength&lt;/a&gt;, while vitamin D is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-for-bone-health-osteoporosis-month-5184304" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hormone that supports bone growth&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Calcium is the main building block that gives bones their structure and strength," said &lt;a href="https://sph.uth.edu/research/centers/dell/dietetic-internship-program/program-faculty.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diana Guevara, MPH, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a community health education specialist at The University of Texas Health Science Center's School of Public Health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It is also used throughout other parts of the body, so if we do not get enough calcium, our bodies could be forced to pull calcium from our bones, leading to osteoporosis and a higher risk of fractures."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bone health, vitamin D's main role is to facilitate calcium absorption in the gut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Without enough vitamin D, calcium cannot do its job well," said &lt;a href="https://search.missouristate.edu/people/natalieallen" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Natalie Allen, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical associate professor of nutrition and dietetics in the School of Health Sciences at Missouri State University. "Pairing them ensures you're getting the bone-strengthening benefit from calcium."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has shown that taking vitamin D and calcium supplements together can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-increase-bone-density-11721928" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; more than taking either supplement alone, specifically in older adults and post-menopausal women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adults generally need 1,000-1,200 mg of calcium and 600-800 IU of vitamin D daily, though some may need more vitamin D depending on age, skin tone, or medical conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's always best to aim to get nutrients from food first if possible, Guevara said, as nutrients in food are easier for the body to absorb and utilize.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may mean eating more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-calcium-snacks-11765792" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dairy foods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish with bones (such as sardines or canned salmon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fortified milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Allen said &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;food sources for vitamin D are limited&lt;/a&gt; as these foods only contain small amounts of the hormone, so supplements are often needed to help people get enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunlight can help your body make vitamin D naturally, but too much sun exposure poses other health risks, such as skin cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "About 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure, a few times per week, can be enough for some people, depending on location and season," Allen said. "Darker skin tones may need more time in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-you-may-need-a-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; When You May Need a Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you spend most of your time indoors or wear sunscreen daily, which Allen notes is important for skin protection, a supplement is often the most reliable way to meet your needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are going to take a supplement, Guevara said it is important to note that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;upper limit of vitamin D for adults&lt;/a&gt; is 4,000 IU per day. Since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-vs-d3-7153133" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;, it can be stored in the body and build up over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new supplements, always talk to your healthcare provider to discuss what's right for your unique health and needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting with a group of my colleagues in a physicians’ meeting, hammering out policy changes and standards for patient care. The conversation wound down as we neared the end of the workday, and chatter shifted from business to our weekend plans. Others in the group shared their family plans for kid’s activities and dance recitals. I shared that I was going to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ravenishak/bacchanal-buffet-review-menu-photos"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s because she doesn’t have kids,” one of the doctors said. Those six words fell out of his mouth with little effort and hung in the middle of the room in the hospital where I had worked for nine years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter broke the silence, and the conversation moved back to the business at hand. People packed up to leave, but I kept turning over his words, which felt big and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My reproductive choices had been casually brought up and then discarded in the middle of our otherwise collegial conversation. In an instant, my joy had been made small. My child-free life was the butt of a joke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a woman in my 40s, I was no stranger to unsolicited comments about my choice not to have kids. Since these judgments were familiar to me, I usually shrugged them off, but this moment hit differently. Over the next few days, I pondered the tone of my colleague’s words and what they implied. Did he mean that because I didn’t have children, I didn’t have any responsibilities at all, so of course I could run off to party in Vegas?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve frequently encountered the notion that a woman without kids is somehow absolved of all life’s burdens and efforts. A lack of children, apparently, is the only reason I can have fun. Sure, there are perks to not having kids, but the assumption that my autonomy comes without the normal weight of human experience is flawed. As an academic surgeon at a major medical hospital, I have plenty of responsibilities. I also have people I care for outside of work and many who rely on me. My free time is filled with travel, friends and so much love. My life has incredible value. So why, to the world, isn’t my life enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a woman can’t have kids she is often portrayed as sad and damaged, but if she simply won’t, she is either deluded, destined to regret it, or written off as a cold hearted, narcissistic, and career obsessed,” Ruby Warrington writes in her book, “Women without Kids.” Though I have an advanced educational degree, a house and a life partner, I have often felt the need to minimize or defend my life choices to mere acquaintances. Even more frustrating, when I am frank about the fact that I don’t want to have kids, I have been made to feel selfish or warned I will regret my choices. I have been given multiple warnings that my career will never be as fulfilling as motherhood — that my life, in general, could never be “full” without children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every unsolicited comment made to me over the years, the lens through which the world sees my life has been made increasingly clear: A woman’s worth is based solely on her willingness to reproduce — not on her intelligence, her work or her contributions to society. My ability to perform lifesaving surgery, my community, my family and all my other aspirations — seem to count for little when I answer “no” to having kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to explain the way I am perceived by my women friends with children, some of whom are also professionals in high-powered fields. But even in these circles of sisterhood, I have found it hard to convey the unique perception women without kids face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really sorry that I talk about my kids so much,” one friend responded after I tried to explain the static I heard from others when stating that I would not have kids. I was so confused and painfully aware of the huge disconnect between us at that moment. While I was attempting to detail the blanket judgment by society on women without children — and how much I have struggled to overcome other people’s assumptions that I must be distraught about the life I so enjoy or the idea that my freedom is somehow conditional and temporary — the conversation with my friend had apparently only aroused guilt in her for the many times she shared sweet memories or minor complaints with me about her kids. She couldn’t understand that her life — her choice — did not make me sad. My comments weren’t about her life. They were about mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, at a meeting about improving the workplace for women, I asked a group to identify what else, outside of pregnancy and motherhood, we could work on to help advocate for all professional women in the hospital. The responses were empty and confused. What other issues could there be, they wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, I’ve come to believe that this singular maternal focus for progress and improved support in the workplace is isolating and narrow. In the medical field especially, while much has been written about the working mother’s perspective and the lack of support she is likely to receive — all true and worthy of our collective attention — there are so many other issues women face in the workplace that are minimized as a result of beating this single drum. What about pay differences, delayed promotion and professional advancement, and lack of adequate support and mentorship for all women in the workplace? The sole focus for the advancement of women professionals seems to be not increasing their success professionally but instead how to create boundaries with work to get them back to their “true” calling and purpose: motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversations about my reproductive life have come in all shapes and sizes, but the most common one has been with both men and women who have tried to convince me that I am wrong. I would be “so good” at it, they say, especially given that I work with children every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 43, I’ve been told numerous times it’s not “too late” to become a mother. Someone once even tried to convince me to have children by telling me that I wouldn’t ever experience the depth of love that exists in the world without them. While I applaud the scientific advances that exist that allow women who want to have children later in life to do so, for those of us who don’t, the data that shows these later pregnancies are complex are worth more than a passing glance. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807657#:~:text=Prior%20research%20found%20that%20women,experience%20infertility%20compared%20with%20nonphysicians." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7986459" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Women physicians are also more likely to delay childbearing, and they&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807657#:~:text=Prior%20research%20found%20that%20women,experience%20infertility%20compared%20with%20nonphysicians." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7986459" data-affiliate="true"&gt;experience increased infertility&lt;/a&gt;, miscarriage and pregnancy complications at higher rates when compared to the general public. None of these aspects of childbearing ever seem to factor into conversations with people who prefer to think I just need some “convincing,” nor does the idea that, perhaps, I have done my research and made an informed and confident decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is I didn’t always feel sure I didn’t want kids. There was a time when I wanted to be a mother, a fact I usually keep to myself for fear that others will interpret this information as hard evidence for the secret, closeted uncertainty I must have about not having kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I will tell you this: I once thought a bright light would flip on in my head and heart, and I would know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wanted to be a mother, like the world said I would. That light did turn on a few times but was never quite as radiant as I expected. Then, in 2020, I watched as the world was ravaged by COVID-19, and I recommitted myself to my work, which had always given my life so much meaning. As I witnessed the rise of increasingly hostile policies around women’s bodies and choices, I also remembered that all these interactions I had with friends, strangers and loved ones were the result of a larger cultural belief about the path a woman’s life should take, rather than about what she wants. And when I really thought long and hard about what I wanted for my life, rather than what I was told would give it the “most” value, the light switched off for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was originally published in August 2024 and we are rerunning it now as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caitlin A.

Admission to day cares would not require those vaccines, either, nor the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. There is no set timeline yet for when the changes will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b87196" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting, held at a small conference room in Panama City Beach, Florida, showcased the ever-widening gulf between pediatricians and opponents of vaccines, some of whom used their moments at the microphone to voice outlandish conspiracy theories and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bafd58" class="body-graf"&gt;Two attendees falsely suggested that this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-rcna248526" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; didn’t happen. (The U.S. has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;more measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt; than in any other since it eliminated the disease in 2000.) Another made inaccurate claims about mRNA vaccines, even though none of the shots in Florida’s plan uses the technology. And one attendee argued that giving children more than one vaccine in a 30-day period “accounts to attempted murder.” (Children often get multiple vaccines at a time to minimize doctor’s visits and because the recommended schedules overlap. Evidence does not suggest the practice is more harmful than spreading them out.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-30d322" class="body-graf"&gt;The event offered a glimpse into the entrenched nature of anti-vaccine beliefs, especially when it comes to school requirements. A growing number of U.S. adults support ending vaccination requirements in public schools: An &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/axios-ipsos-american-health-index" target="_blank"&gt;October poll&lt;/a&gt; from Axios and Ipsos put the share at 26%, compared with 19% in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fde44f" class="body-graf"&gt;Although Florida is the only U.S. state attempting to do away with school vaccine mandates, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made scrutinizing vaccines and sowing doubts about their safety a key pillar of his agenda as the country’s top health leader. Kennedy has suggested that children receive too many shots, that many routine vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;weren’t properly safety tested&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/cdc-research-debunked-link-vaccines-autism-rcna195499" target="_blank"&gt;there is insufficient evidence to say they do not cause autism&lt;/a&gt; — a stance that vigorous medical studies have thoroughly and repeatedly debunked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af1e48" class="body-graf"&gt;Northe Saunders, president of the pro-vaccine group American Families for Vaccines, said Kennedy has energized vaccine skeptics at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05c92b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The secretary has a bully pulpit and is certainly driving messaging down to his anti-vaccine supporters,” Saunders said. “We’re definitely seeing that echoed in comments like we heard today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bb799" class="body-graf"&gt;Florida’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, emerged during the Covid pandemic as a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/desantis-administration-advises-no-covid-shots-under-65-rcna104912" target="_blank"&gt;prominent skeptic&lt;/a&gt; of coronavirus vaccines. In September, he &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/florida-surgeon-general-says-state-will-eliminate-vaccine-mandates-rcna228835" target="_blank"&gt;equated school vaccine mandates to slavery&lt;/a&gt; and pledged that his health department would work to eliminate them. (State law already allows parents to claim religious and medical exemptions to school vaccine mandates.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56e193" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the Florida health department only has the authority to repeal mandates for hepatitis B, chickenpox, pneumococcal and Hib vaccines. School mandates for vaccines that protect against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, mumps and rubella must be repealed through legislation, and no law to revoke them has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3507db" class="body-graf"&gt;At the two-hour meeting on Friday, doctors implored Florida’s health department not to repeal mandates for the four vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-105499" class="body-graf"&gt;“I feel very sad to hear the distrust of physicians in the medical community. We only have our patients’ welfare in mind,” said Dr. Frederick Southwick, an infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e123fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Several doctors recalled harrowing experiences treating kids for vaccine-preventable illnesses, including Hib and meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that the pneumococcal vaccine protects against).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7632e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“When I trained at Vanderbilt, our wards were filled with children suffering from diseases we now prevent,” said Dr. Paul Robinson, a pediatrician. “I can still picture a 2-year-old girl whom I treated with Hib who was left partially paralyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea16d3" class="body-graf"&gt;Jamie Schanbaum, who said a case of meningitis that she came down with in college led to multiple amputations, emphasized that the disease can be prevented through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c9af2" class="body-graf"&gt;“No one should go through this experience. Excuse me as I try to go through my notes without fingers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd097b" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Florida’s health department is still accepting written comments on the proposed changes; a final decision is not likely to come until next year. When asked about when the mandates could be repealed, the department said it was “committed to moving forward with the rule change process” according to state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 01:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQbE9vaExJM0lWbjNDbmJjNmVIV2plaUd0M2NvaTVaWU01R19TdzdsVzlFNC1NcXNHMy1Rd3V3cmJsVWVwc3hyLXdCRTlEY3o3MFpndFdzeDBtOEtXWjBvd1BZLTlOMUpodXNOMDQxTWdTYjY1RWpxVGlrZW1nWUx2T1FacU9raFRzMW9ucXltYlB4aGNFaGR0ZEVGYmlCcko3T0FHbGwxUXbSAVZBVV95cUxObDFkZV85bWk3Vk96ZUMyM2pmb0Y4VVpxR3g0dVRyQ2xtSjZqcWFFVGFXQ1dGWndQNzdoeVg1ZTEyLXNYQWQ2dFZNUHh5QWNUZW1GSXZ5QQ</guid></item><item><title>睡前隐藏的大脑状态可能是人类天才的关键- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-brain-state-before-sleep-may-be-the-key-to-human-genius</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Beatles' song &lt;em&gt;Yesterday&lt;/em&gt; was written in what psychologists refer to as the "hypnagogic state". This is the twilight zone between sleep and wakefulness, when we drowsily linger in a semi-conscious state, experiencing vivid mental images and sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up one morning in early 1965, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/paul-mccartneys-the-lyrics-an-extraordinary-life-in-song-171603"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; became aware of a long complex melody playing inside his head. He jumped straight out of bed, sat down at his piano and picked out the melody on the keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quickly found the chords to go with the melody and created some holding phrases (as songwriters call them, before they write proper lyrics) to fit the melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-scientific-reason-why-some-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head"&gt;There's a Scientific Reason Why Some Songs Get Stuck in Your Head&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding it difficult to believe that such a beautiful melody could emerge&lt;br&gt;
spontaneously, McCartney suspected that he was subconsciously plagiarising another composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/15793/9781802064223"&gt;As he recalled&lt;/a&gt;: "For about a month I went round to people in the music business and asked them whether they had ever heard it before … I thought if no one claimed it after a few weeks, then I could have it." But it turned out to be original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184582" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Brain-With-Swirls-1-642x361.jpg" alt="Colorful illustration of a human brain " class="size-medium wp-image-184582" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Brain-With-Swirls-1-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Brain-With-Swirls-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Brain-With-Swirls-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Brain-With-Swirls-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184582" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Creativity often comes from beyond  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="184551" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.

The physicist Niels Bohr effectively won the Nobel prize while semi-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drifting off to sleep, he dreamt he saw the nucleus of the atom, with the electrons spinning around it, just like the Solar System with the Sun and planets – and in this way he "discovered" the structure of the atom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the hypnagogic state is a creative "sweet spot." For example, in a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj5866"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, participants in a hypnagogic state were three times more likely to discover the "hidden rule" that could solve a mathematical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists associate creativity with qualities such as openness to experience and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1717362115"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/31/10/4464/6249829"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that creativity arises from co-ordination between the cognitive control network of the brain (which deals with planning and problem solving) and the default mode network (which is associated with daydreaming and mind-wandering).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in my view, one of the most important theories of creativity is one of the oldest, put forward by the early British psychologist &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.34"&gt;Frederic Myers&lt;/a&gt; in 1881. According to Myers, ideas and insights come as a sudden "uprush" from a subliminal mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Myers saw it, our conscious mind is just a small segment of our overall mind, including not only what Sigmund Freud called the unconscious, but also wider and higher levels of consciousness. Ideas may gestate unconsciously for a long time before they emerge into conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why it often feels as if ideas come from beyond the mind, as if they are gifted to us. They can come from beyond our conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The importance of relaxation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypnagogic state is so creative because, as we hover between sleep and wakefulness, the conscious mind is barely active. For a brief period, our mental boundaries are permeable, and there is a chance creative insights and ideas will flow through from the subliminal mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, this is why creativity is often associated with relaxation and idleness. When we relax, our conscious minds are usually less active. Often, when we are busy, our minds are full of chattering thoughts, so there is no space for creative insights to flow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also why meditation is &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000557"&gt;strongly associated with creativity&lt;/a&gt;. Research &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810008001967"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that meditation promotes general creative qualities such as openness to experience and cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-brains-really-do-sync-up-when-we-collaborate-study-reveals"&gt;Our Brains Really Do 'Sync Up' When We Collaborate, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps even more importantly, meditation quietens and softens the conscious mind, so that we're more liable to receive inspiration from beyond it. As I point out in my book &lt;a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/15793/9781781809211"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Leap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is why there is a strong connection between spiritual awakening and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184578" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184578" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Blue-Eye--642x361.jpg" alt="Colorful paint around a bright blue eye" class="size-medium wp-image-184578" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Blue-Eye--642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Blue-Eye--768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Blue-Eye--600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/Colorful-Blue-Eye-.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184578" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Many great discoveries and inventions have emerged from the hypnagogic state.

It is slightly more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is most likely to occur at the onset of sleep, but can also occur on waking up, or during the day if we become drowsy and zone out of normal consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we use the hypnagogic state to enhance our creativity? It's certainly possible to linger in the hypnagogic state, as you probably know from Sunday morning lie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one of the difficulties is capturing the ideas that arise. In our drowsiness, we may not feel the impulse to record our ideas. It's tempting to tell ourselves before falling back to sleep, "This is such a good idea that it will definitely stick in my mind." But when we wake up some time later, the idea is gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, through mental training, there is no reason why we can't build up a habit of recording our hypnagogic ideas. The best practice is to keep a pen and paper right on a bedside table. Or for a more contemporary variant, keep your phone beside the bed, with the recording app open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence"&gt;Study Traces Autism's Origin to The Rise of Human Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is a practice that Paul McCartney has always followed. He even trained himself to write in the dark for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also use a technique of "&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thomas-edisons-naps-inspire-a-way-to-spark-your-own-creativity/"&gt;conscious napping&lt;/a&gt;" to generate ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever the great inventor Thomas Edison was stuck for a solution or new idea, he would allow himself to drift into unconsciousness, while holding a metal ball. As he fell asleep, the ball would clatter to the ground and wake him, when he would often find that a new insight had emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, we should use idleness as a way of cultivating creativity. Don't think of napping or relaxing as a waste of time. Far from being unproductive, they may lead to the most inspired ideas and insights of our lives.

This week the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgmy90z991o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;BBC reported&lt;/a&gt; on a man whose sperm contained a genetic mutation that dramatically raises the risk of cancer for some of his offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One of the most striking aspects of the investigation was that the man's sperm was sent to 14 countries and produced at least 197 children. The revelation was a rare insight into the scale of the sperm donor industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sperm donation allows women to become mothers when it might not otherwise be possible - if their partner is infertile, they're in a same-sex relationship, or parenting solo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Filling that need has become big business. It is estimated the market in Europe will be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/europe-sperm-bank-market" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;worth more than £2bn by 2033&lt;/a&gt;, with Denmark a major exporter of sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So why are some sperm donors fathering so many children, what made Danish or so-called "Viking sperm" so popular, and does the industry need to be reined in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Most men's sperm isn't good enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you're a man reading this, we are sorry to break it to you, but the quality of your sperm probably isn't good enough to become a donor - fewer than five in 100 volunteers actually make the grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;First, you have to produce enough sperm in a sample - that's your &lt;b id="sperm-count" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;sperm count&lt;/b&gt; - then pass checks on how well they swim - their &lt;b id="motility" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;motility &lt;/b&gt;- and on their shape or &lt;b id="morphology" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;morphology&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sperm is also checked to ensure it can survive being frozen and stored at a sperm bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;You could be perfectly fertile, have six children, and still not be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4cd7/live/1efef320-d791-11f0-8cf3-633e3244a1d2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Graphical representation of sperm in bright pink against a dark background.

In the UK, half the sperm ends up being imported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But biology means a small number of donors can make vast numbers of children. It takes just one sperm to fertilise an egg, but there are tens of millions of sperm in each ejaculation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Men will come to the clinic once or twice a week while they're donating, which can be for months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust charity which works on fertility and genomics, said the donor sperm shortage made it "a precious commodity" and "sperm banks and fertility clinics are maximising the use of available donors to meet demand".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Some sperm is more popular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/574e/live/20cefc60-d78a-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Allan Pacey Man with white stubble on his chin smiles at the camera.

He told the BBC the Danish "blue-eyed and blonde-haired genes" are recessive traits, which means they  need to come from both parents in order to appear in a child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As a result, the mother's traits, such as dark hair, "might be dominant in the resulting child", Schou explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He says demand for donor sperm is coming mainly from "single, highly-educated, women in their 30s who have focused on their careers and left family planning too late".

Sometimes it is linked to a total number of children, others limit it to a certain number of mothers (so each family can have as many related children as they want).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The original argument around those limits was to avoid half-siblings - who didn't know they were related - meeting each other, forming relationships and having children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But there's nothing to stop the same donor's sperm being used in Italy and Spain and then the Netherlands and Belgium, as long as the rules are being followed in each country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This creates circumstances where a sperm donor can legally father large numbers of children. Although the man is often in the dark about that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Many recipients, and also donors, are unaware that a single donor's sperm can be lawfully used in many different countries - this fact should be better explained," says Sarah Norcross, who argues it would be "sensible" to bring down the number of children one donor can have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dca8/live/6824bbc0-d787-11f0-b0ee-a9375724f730.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Sperm samples standing in a tank with dry ice smoke coming out of it" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sperm is frozen until it is needed by families&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In response to the investigation into the sperm donor who passed on a gene that led to cancer in some of the 197 children he fathered, officials in Belgium have called on the European Commission to establish a Europe-wide sperm donor register to monitor sperm travelling across borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Deputy prime minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the industry was like the "Wild West" and "the initial mission of offering people the possibility of a family has given way to a veritable fertility business".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has also proposed a limit of 50 families per donor across the EU.

In the UK, there is no longer anonymity for sperm donors and there is an official process through which children learn the identity of their biological father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Mr Schou at Cryos argues more restrictions on sperm donation would just lead families to "turn to the private, totally unregulated, market".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr John Appleby, a medical ethicist at Lancaster University, said the implications of using sperm so widely was a "vast" ethical minefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there are issues around identity, privacy, consent, dignity and more - making it a "balancing act" between competing needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Appleby said the fertility industry had a "responsibility to get a handle on the number of times a donor is used", but agreeing global regulations would be undeniably "very difficult".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He added that a global sperm donor register, which has been suggested, came with its own "ethical and legal challenges".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 00:09:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE82WWdPb0VScGFENFdKN182VHpqZkpPRVFRMUJhcjhtWFpWWWFXSExhODF2WngxeU1xa2lYbl9GS2M1NU5XX1lLZFZoUEgzQmhwOGZvMVoyeUVud9IBX0FVX3lxTE9sWUZZdWt6b2J6U1BSaFJtYTRVVmI4a2xmY0pUODhmd3psbktjd0xqWVZ2bUZfeDl3THZxTUV1TlAyZEtYU1hIZjZKTDJLWlc5aWNMSXlVa0toUTFZeGdZ</guid></item><item><title>基于风险的筛查以及40岁后发现乳腺癌的年度检查-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/health/jama-breast-cancer-risk-based-screening.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 23:45:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNbUloSUluT2N4dWxSUDM4RDdaOUVkSE52ZjlQaFhtNHlzbW9SbklYdUY4UHZhZzZ6dzA4cnQ4enFaMThWWlI2cTByNFpadTVGYUdRbUloUFNWTkliRVVLejk0akxqdmpYR3hWM0xwSDNwUUZRaF9JZDlpZDN1WkFQb3FQdWl1OGc1N0laVnlENA</guid></item><item><title>婴儿潮一代开始出现移动性问题-移动它们的设备已经过时且痛苦- Daily Kos</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/12/12/2358164/-Boomers-are-Starting-to-Have-Mobility-Issues-Devices-to-Mobilize-Them-are-Antiquated-and-Painful</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This diary will discuss two interrelated medical issues: opioids and medically induced pain, and inadequate methods for mobilizing disabled patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in addition to pain from diseases and accidents, medicine as it is currently practiced is replete with medically induced pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, basic patient care with respect to medical mobility and transfer devices is inefficient, invasive, and pain-inducing for patients, and labor intensive for nurses and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s first discuss pain. Medical treatment and rehab are often assumed to be painful. However the assumption that medically-induced pain is necessary is sometimes incorrect  But until recently, nurses and doctors have generally devalued or ignored a variety of kinds of patient pain and &lt;em&gt;understandably&lt;/em&gt; focused primarily on curing and healing patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a huge problem arose – the Opioid Crisis. The combined mass of pain from diseases, accidents and medical practices has led to this crisis with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;47,000 deaths in 2017&lt;/a&gt; with 36% of those deaths involving prescription opioids.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, drug companies and medical professionals have been forced to deal with a variety of deficiencies in medical and pharmaceutical practices that brought about this deadly crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to respond, the National Institute of Health’s HEAL initiative initially spent &lt;strong&gt;$945M on research to reduce opioid addiction &lt;/strong&gt;(OUD). Pain researchers sought to find and limit the sources of pain that led to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health and  Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pmtf-final-report-2019-05-23.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2019 PMTF final report on pain management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; document &lt;/span&gt;describes &lt;strong&gt;“gaps” in the medical system’s approach to pain&lt;/strong&gt; that have contributed to the opioid crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, their analysis reveals an &lt;strong&gt;uncritical acceptance of the pain-inducing patient care&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;devices and methods universally used by nurses and caregivers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most researchers look to external or unavoidable factors (accidents, diseases, rehab) as sources of pain and avoid examining the pain-inducing “best practices” used in daily patient hospital, nursing home, and home care.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominant “state of the art” safe patient handling (SPH) device was invented in the 1950’s and copied devices used to lift engine blocks in auto repair facilities. Newer models are electric, have better slings, and are lighter but work the same as the older ones (see picture). These devices have been overlooked as a repeating source of acute pain for patients and frustration for caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the sources of medically induced pain during patient care and transfer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sling lifts, stand-and-pivot-transfer (e.g., pull patient to stand them up, pivot them, and lower them down onto a wheelchair), and manual lifting of patients (requiring 3 to 6 caregivers) generally require some combination of &lt;strong&gt;bending, twisting, stretching, compressing, hoisting, rolling, and dragging patients&lt;/strong&gt;. These are all overly invasive methods of transfer with the latter two also endangering the caregiver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These common patient care activities are often painful and sometime anxiety-producing for a wide variety of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such repetitive sources of acute pain&lt;/strong&gt; arise from bed transfer, wheelchair transfer, toileting, and showering. In hospitals where patients often have high levels of post-operative pain and dependency, the source of such pain can also include transfer to radiology, surgical, rehab, and examining tables.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In home care, where sling lifts are mostly unusable (according to nursing experts), &lt;strong&gt;Hospice and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;palliative patients in the home easily become bed-bound for weeks and months prior to death putting enormous stress on home care nurses and family caregivers&lt;/strong&gt;. This is yet another source of pain as bed-bound patients are subject to bed sores, urinary tract infections,  pneumonia, and depression among other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because cost-effective devices to mobilize highly dependent patients in the home have not yet been&lt;span&gt; inv&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;nted or improved methods have not been accepted by Physical Medicine physicians and the SPH and rehab communities. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain researchers a&lt;span&gt;re n&lt;/span&gt;ow seeking &lt;strong&gt;to reduce the need for pharmaceutical remedies to treat acute and chronic pain.&lt;/strong&gt;  Inadequate, antiquated SPH methods are the perfect examples of inefficiency and waste in a medical system that sometimes relies on unnecessary medication (anti-anxiety medicine and opioids) to compensate for painful, slow, labor-intensive patient care devices and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lifts devices are slow (3-6 min. transfer), bulky (oddly shaped and difficult to store and retrieve), painful (hoisting bending, and compressing patients), inefficient (requiring two trained caregivers to operate), and anxiety inducing (especially for many dementia and geriatric patients).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have the &lt;em&gt;distinct advantage of preventing nursing back injuries&lt;/em&gt; but at considerable cost to patients and to institutions by consuming a large amount of scant nursing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surprising part of all this is that there has been virtually no government-sponsored research on better devices in decades, and medical devices companies seem frozen in place with little or no innovation partly fearing lawsuits for innovative devices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must a better way. However, experts at the American Nurses Association, the National Institute of Health, the VA Patient Safety Center, and other research institutions seem unwilling to acknowledge that the challenge exists as they continue to recommend antiquated devices and methods as “best practices.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The public needs to be informed about what is actually a multifaceted public health emergency directly affecting patients, caregivers, physical therapists, nurses, and especially the financial viability Medicare and Medicaid. This is the case because the accepted SPH devices and methods are inefficient and labor-intensive wasting tens (and eventually hundreds) of billions of dollars during patient care for the dying, disabled, and mobility challenged.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, care of dementia patients alone (dementia has no cure and often requires around the clock care involving the transfer of patients multiple times daily) is predicted to rise from $200B (2013) to $1.1T (2050) by the Alzheimers organization’s website ( &lt;a href="http://www.alz.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.alz.org)&lt;/a&gt;. Slow, inefficient patient care activities (so-called ADLs) repeated multiple times daily per patient are a direct threat to financial viability of these organizations while they also quickly exhaust limited nursing resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Baby boomers (whether caring for their aging parents or becoming mobility-challenged themselves) are in for a shock when they realize how limited their medical options are when they or someone they know loses mobility and becomes partially or fully dependent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only informed patients, caregivers, health professionals, nursing advocacy organizations, and public pressure will bring about a change in this area of physical medicine where innovation has been practically nonexistent over the past 60 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;I've been vegan for over a decade, and I'll be honest: I used to judge people who quit. Like, really judge them. I'd see those "why I'm no longer vegan" videos and immediately think they just weren't committed enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I started actually talking to ex-vegans instead of dismissing them, and what I learned completely shifted my perspective on what it means to be vegan in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to 50 people who'd been vegan for at least a year before quitting. I wanted real answers, not internet drama. What I found wasn't a bunch of people who missed bacon or couldn't handle the lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was way more complicated and honestly, way more useful for those of us still in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Social isolation was the number one reason, and it wasn't even close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three people mentioned feeling isolated as a primary factor. Not just "oh, restaurants are hard" isolated. We're talking deep, friendship-ending, family-dinner-ruining isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman told me she stopped getting invited to her book club because she'd politely declined their potlucks too many times. Another guy said his college friends just stopped texting him about hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what hit me: these weren't people being difficult about their veganism. They were just existing as vegans in spaces that weren't built for them. The isolation wasn't about the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about being seen as the person who makes everything complicated, even when you're trying your hardest not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one stung because I've definitely felt it too. The difference is I had a supportive partner and lived in a vegan-friendly city. Not everyone has that safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Health issues that may or may not have been related to veganism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventeen people cited health concerns. But here's where it gets interesting: only four of them had actually worked with a doctor or nutritionist who specialized in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest were either self-diagnosing or working with professionals who immediately blamed veganism for everything from fatigue to hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person told me their doctor said they needed to eat meat for iron, despite never checking their levels or suggesting supplements. Another developed digestive issues and assumed it was the beans, when it might have been the massive increase in fiber their gut wasn't ready for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying veganism works for every single body. But I am saying most of these people didn't get the support they needed to figure out if the diet was actually the problem. They just got told to eat chicken and felt relief that someone gave them permission to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. The vegan community itself pushed people away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one hurt to hear, but twelve people specifically mentioned toxic experiences with other vegans. Someone posted a picture of their meal in a vegan Facebook group and got attacked because one ingredient might not have been organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person asked a genuine question about B12 and got called a fake vegan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purity politics are real, and they're doing serious damage. When you're already struggling and the people who are supposed to be your community are critiquing your every move, why would you stay? One ex-vegan told me she felt more judgment from vegans than she ever did from meat-eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this behavior and called it "passionate advocacy." But passion that makes people feel small isn't advocacy. It's just being mean with a moral license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Life transitions made veganism feel impossible to maintain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven people quit during major life changes: pregnancy, new demanding jobs, caring for sick family members, financial hardship. When you're barely holding it together, being vegan can feel like one more thing you're failing at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if you've internalized the idea that being vegan requires perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new mom told me she was too exhausted to meal prep and her family kept bringing her chicken soup. She felt guilty every time she ate it, but she also needed to eat something. Eventually she just stopped trying. A grad student said when he was working three jobs, the free pizza at work became too important to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't moral failures. These are people in survival mode making the choices available to them. But the all-or-nothing messaging in vegan spaces doesn't leave room for that nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They never really understood why they were doing it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight people told me they went vegan because it seemed like the healthy or trendy thing to do, but they never connected with the ethical or environmental reasons. When the initial motivation faded or got hard, there was nothing deeper to hold onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person said they went vegan after watching a documentary but never really thought about it again. When friends questioned them, they didn't have answers. When it got inconvenient, they didn't have a reason to push through. They were vegan in practice but not in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This taught me something important: we need to help people find their own why, not just hand them ours. A why that resonates personally is a why that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. The financial reality hit harder than expected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people mentioned cost, but not in the way I anticipated. They weren't saying vegetables are expensive. They were talking about living in food deserts, losing access to Whole Foods after moving, or not being able to afford the extra time it takes to prepare everything from scratch when convenient vegan options weren't available locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman lived in a small town where the only grocery store barely stocked produce. Ordering specialty items online was prohibitively expensive with shipping. She felt trapped between her values and her reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person's work schedule meant they relied heavily on convenience foods, and the vegan options cost twice as much as the regular ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veganism can absolutely be affordable, but it requires resources beyond money: time, access, knowledge, and energy. Not everyone has all of those at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what changed for me: I used to think people who quit veganism lacked commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I see that many of them were failed by the systems around them, including the vegan community itself. They needed support, flexibility, and understanding, and instead they got judgment, isolation, and impossible standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want more people to go vegan and stay vegan, we need to build a movement that's actually sustainable for real humans living real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means celebrating progress over perfection, offering genuine support instead of purity tests, and acknowledging that someone doing their best in difficult circumstances is worth more than someone who had it easy and quit when it got hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn't to keep people vegan through guilt or gatekeeping. The goal is to create a world where being vegan is so supported, accessible, and normal that people want to stay. These 50 people taught me we're not there yet, but understanding why might help us get closer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Florida officials are plowing ahead with a proposal to roll back certain vaccine mandates for the state’s schoolchildren, after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called for the state to become the first in the nation to eliminate &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-childhood-vaccines-mandate-eliminate-desantis-363323dcdd3811ca9ad7def5f9a30fb2"&gt;all school vaccination requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians, infectious disease physicians and teachers have decried the push to undermine vaccines, which for generations have been a cornerstone of public health policy for keeping children and adults safe from potentially deadly — but preventable — diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned that doing away with the mandates could allow for a dangerous resurgence of preventable childhood diseases and deaths, amounting to a reversal of one of the greatest advancements in public health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of parents, physicians, educators and advocates crowded into a hotel conference room in Panama City Beach on Friday to testify on a rule change proposed by the Florida Department of Health that would eliminate requirements that Florida children receive the hepatitis B, varicella and Haemophilus influenzae type b or Hib vaccines in order to attend public or private K-12 schools. The proposal also does away with a requirement for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children attending child care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Other state mandates related to vaccines for polio, mumps, tetanus and other diseases are enshrined in Florida law and would require legislative action to be rolled back. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pediatrician Eehab Kenawy, who practices in Panama City, detailed two unvaccinated children his hospital has cared for in the past six months, both of whom contracted Hib, which can cause severe infections and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="embed-caption"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“One child unfortunately succumbed at four months of age. No vaccines,” Kenawy said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The mother of another Hib patient, a two-and-a-half-year-old, begged to have her child vaccinated after the child developed a grave brain infection, Kenawy said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Quote unquote, mother’s words: ‘please give my child every vaccine you can,’ ” he said. “This is what we’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who has long clashed with the medical establishment, has cast current requirements in schools and elsewhere as “immoral” intrusions on people’s rights that hamper parents’ ability to make health decisions for their children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/by-age/years-4-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a number of diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. Most &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/states-with-religious-and-philosophical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;also permit exemptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for religious or other nonmedical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Emotional public hearing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday’s public hearing grew emotional at times, as parents and activists opposed to the mandates heralded the importance of personal freedom, while longtime physicians recalled hospital wards full of gravely sick children in the years before the widespread availability of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pediatrician Paul Robinson trained at Vanderbilt University in the 1980s, he cared for countless children “suffering from diseases we now prevent,” including Hib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It didn’t cause mild illness. It caused children to die,” Robinson said, recalling the survivors who were left with “deafness, paralysis or lifelong neurologic injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy being pushed by the state’s surgeon general is “dangerous,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Schanbaum’s legs and fingers were amputated after she contracted meningitis as a 20-year-old college student in Texas. She traveled from Brooklyn, New York, to testify in support of vaccines, recounting her seven-month hospital stay as she battled the vaccine-preventable disease and the challenges of living without her limbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one should go through this experience,” Schanbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How about the relearning to use my hands? Feed myself? Wipe myself? This is the reality of what it’s like to survive something like this,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Rise of vaccine skepticism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination efforts &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;across the country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/global-vaccination-efforts-stall-leaving-millions-of-children-vulnerable-to-preventable-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have stalled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw an explosion in vaccine skepticism. Florida’s proposal comes as U.S. Department of Health Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has worked to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccine-policies-promises-d1ad570053583d953f15ec3e566e426f"&gt;reshape the nation’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to match his long-standing suspicions about the safety and effectiveness of well-established shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Helms, a mother and grandmother from Apalachicola, Florida, referenced Kennedy as she voiced her “full support” for rolling back the mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Medical choice and medical freedom in all ways is a God-given and sovereign human right,” Helms said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Sweetin’s voiced filled with emotion as she described her then-newborn son being rushed off for a hepatitis B shot that she said “injured” him. Sweetin is a marketing executive for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/anti-science-bills-hit-statehouses-stripping-away-public-health-protections-built-over-a-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;connected to Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“This is not informed consent. That is coercion. Vaccines should never be tied to a child’s education,” Sweetin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the state consulted national medical experts such as the American Academy of Pediatrics on the rule development, a department representative declined to answer directly, stating: “the rule language is grounded in policy based on considerations that favor parental rights and medical freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles outbreak in South Carolina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s push comes as a monthslong measles outbreak continues in South Carolina, almost entirely among school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials there have said 116 of the 126 cases have been in children under 18, with two-thirds of them in children from age 5 to 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has been centered in Spartanburg County, where just 90% of students have all the vaccinees required to be in school — one of the lowest rates in South Carolina. The state has a religious exemption for vaccines, and almost all of the unvaccinated students use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press writer Jeffrey Collins contributed from Columbia, South Carolina.

The person who died was a man in his 50s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials expressed condolences to the man’s family and emphasized the importance of taking steps to prevent further spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last flu season, Idaho reported 87 influenza-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials are urging residents who have not yet been vaccinated to visit their health care provider, local public health district, or pharmacy. They note that getting vaccinated now will offer protection through the remainder of the flu season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that typically causes fever, headache, fatigue, and sometimes cough or sore throat. While most people recover within a few days, the flu can lead to serious complications and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those at higher risk for severe illness include pregnant women, adults 50 and older, individuals with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart and lung disease, and people living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. Caregivers and household members of high-risk individuals are also urged to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials recommend the following steps to help prevent the spread of influenza:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and avoid close contact with people who appear sick.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Stay home from work or school when ill.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Wash hands frequently, especially after being in public places, and avoid touching your face until hands are clean.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Get adequate rest, stay hydrated, eat nutritious foods, and remain physically active.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on influenza and prevention, residents can contact Southeastern Idaho Public Health at (208) 233-9080.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNSnBWRUQ1SG1NekZyX2ZQdVp4b21KQU1DX0k4cG80Mk9lWFY3M2h4TjdGbjJrbEJXdTRSMDA2TFJfM3RET0FJZlBXU2dBd1pCa2pNZ3R3Y0RtZVpTTWJXOS1PQlBYSjJUNEI1RFhVWVZERV83aGtqQjRpVVFMcGxwZjlHM3ktSnktTHZLRmVnUkhxRG1nSXRBVnBxN0gya2taX1AzMg</guid></item><item><title>额外：医生说热辣的婴儿不是药- Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/extra-extra-doctors-say-hot-toddies-are-not-medicine</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-donation-CTA"&gt;&lt;p class="h6"&gt;We rely on your support to make local news available to all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="type-textlink2 no-underline"&gt; Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. &lt;a to="https://pledge.wnyc.org/support/gothamist/?utm_medium=partnersite&amp;amp;utm_source=gothamist&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article-top" target="_blank" raw="false" rawhover="none" class="author-name flexible-link external author-name" href="https://pledge.wnyc.org/support/gothamist/?utm_medium=partnersite&amp;amp;utm_source=gothamist&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article-top" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Donate today &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPNW1tVVpOT0xwYnBIRmtWRzdwNEhPb2ppeHUwREpteURfVXpPY2sxalB0elQ4cU9LTEUwbFlHR3BBbU93R2NJSURDRFhaLXhLZmx2eWQ4SmdvRkh3bEZtVTJUcTVKNm5VTDQzTGdlSWtCdm5CRnpXa1IzRlE1czluX2hNWEVMdw</guid></item><item><title>梅德福的疑似诺如病毒爆发是否是将要发生的事情的迹象？以下是专家们的看法。- Boston.com</title><link>https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/12/12/suspected-medford-norovirus-outbreak-experts-weigh-in/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="content-well content-well--article" role="main"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/tag/health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;: the bane of cruise ships and terror of grade-school parents and teachers alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aptly known as the “winter vomiting disease,” norovirus has the startling ability to tear through schools, households, and digestive systems with reckless abandon, as seen recently in Medford, where an elementary school &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/12/11/what-to-know-about-norovirus-after-suspected-outbreak-closes-medford-elementary-school-closed-for-second-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;closed for two days&lt;/a&gt; this week amid a suspected outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it’s still early on in cold and flu season, Medford might not be alone in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s ever a good idea to admire a pathogen, but this one is pretty unbelievable,” said &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/providers/richard-malley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Richard Malley&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious diseases clinician at Boston Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some ways, norovirus is the perfect pathogen,” agreed &lt;a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/neil-maniar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Neil Maniar&lt;/a&gt;, director of Northeastern University’s master of public health program. “It’s highly contagious, it can last on surfaces for up to two weeks, and it’s very difficult to kill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 10 to 100 viral particles is enough to make someone sick with norovirus — a miniscule amount, and only a small fraction of what you’d typically find in a sick person’s bodily fluids, Malley pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s true that sometimes in a family, you have the index case — you know, somebody brings it in — and then before you know it, everybody in the home is having the same symptoms,” he said. “And hopefully, [they’re] not inviting anybody else to visit them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winter months offer something of a perfect storm for transmission as people attend holiday parties and spend more time indoors, coming into contact with the same high-touch surfaces or possibly contaminated food, explained Maniar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes there are typically about 2,500 reported norovirus outbreaks in the U.S. each year, most commonly between November and April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, it looks like the seasonality trend is holding this year as well,” Maniar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can be particularly devastating for educational settings like Medford’s Roberts Elementary School, where Principal Michelle Crowell reported a “high volume of stomach illness cases” Wednesday and &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/12/10/medford-elementary-school-cancels-thursday-classes-due-to-suspected-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 130 student absences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With present students and staff also reporting “symptoms of an upset stomach,” the school opted to close Thursday and Friday so that a professional company could deep clean the building. The Medford Board of Health was also due to examine cafeteria equipment to rule out “other potential causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-norovirus-in-schools"&gt;Norovirus in schools&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In schools, norovirus “can wreak a lot of havoc, because this is such a highly transmittable virus,” Maniar said. “It’s an environment where it becomes very easy for norovirus to spread, and then once it starts spreading, it doesn’t take much for a large proportion of the population to be exposed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malley likewise noted that schools are a common site for outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The school environment is, you know, a wonderful place for children to learn and to socialize,” he said. “It’s also, unfortunately, a very good place for norovirus to be transmitted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malley acknowledged it’s tricky to determine when to close a school during an outbreak, as Medford did, and he stopped short of discussing specific criteria. However, when case numbers balloon and standard interventions fail — for example, using industrial-strength cleaners and asking parents to keep children home for some time after they’ve been sick — “it’s very reasonable to consider closing the school for a while,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is obviously not something that schools do lightly, because school closures pose all sorts of issues — psychological, financial, educational, there’s all sorts of issues involved,” Malley continued. “But obviously it’s better than letting an outbreak of norovirus go rampant in a school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a significant percentage of the population seems to be exhibiting symptoms, Maniar said, a school closure is “certainly one way to try to break the cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any time you’re dealing with a very contagious virus like norovirus, it’s really hard to put the brakes on it completely, but you can … disrupt the spread enough to potentially limit an outbreak, which in itself is beneficial,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the Medford school closure, &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/shira-doron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Shira Doron&lt;/a&gt;, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, noted norovirus typically sees smaller numbers of people getting sick over a longer period of time. She suggested further investigation is needed in Medford to rule out other potential causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, did they all eat the same thing?” she explained. “Did they all eat food that was touched by the same equipment or person? You know, [is there] some contaminant in their environment, or food that could have gotten a lot of people sick at the same time?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because norovirus is notoriously difficult to kill, “there is definitely rationale for professional cleaning,” Doron added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to use specific chemicals at a specific concentration and for a specific period of time, meaning the surface has to stay wet with that chemical for a certain amount of time,” she said. “And we know from the real world that things can go wrong in that process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-newer-norovirus-strain-takes-over"&gt;A newer norovirus strain takes over&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters, the GII.17 norovirus variant has become increasingly prevalent over the past few years, growing from less than 10% of cases during the 2022–23 season to 75% during the 2024–25 season, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The agency also noted a prolonged outbreak season in 2024, with cases continuing into the summer “likely [as] the result of sustained circulation of GII.17.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CioQACABSAByCjIwMjUtMTAtMzFyCjIwMjUtMTItMTKKAQZiYjQ2NTLAAQE%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=bb4652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt; shows norovirus generally trending upward in Massachusetts since October.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know in terms of severity or other characteristics of the symptoms whether it’s worse or not, but there are a couple things that are a little bit puzzling” about the GII.17 variant, Malley said. “One of them is that the outbreak seems to be starting a little earlier this year than we would have expected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a concern, he said, because an epidemic that starts earlier than usual allows more time for people to become infected before the outbreak passes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there remains some uncertainty around the GII.17 variant, Maniar said it’s generally a good idea to try to get ahead of norovirus with frequent and thorough handwashing, surface disinfectants, and self-isolation when feeling unwell. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;don’t work well&lt;/a&gt; against norovirus, so the CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should also avoid touching their faces or putting their fingers in their mouths, Doron advised. She reminded families to disinfect high-touch surfaces such as door knobs, countertops, and toilets.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have had norovirus go through my house several times. My kids are in their 20s, so I’ve been through it and never got it,” Doron said. “I do attribute that to just really being conscientious of where my hands are going and how often I’m cleaning them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both she and Malley said dehydration from norovirus can warrant a trip to the doctor or emergency room, with small children and immunocompromised individuals particularly vulnerable. Still, Malley pointed out that while highly contagious, norovirus is generally a self-limited infection that resolves within a few days without long-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Medford’s school closure is certainly notable, he emphasized it’s not necessarily unusual when dealing with such a tricky virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents should not be surprised when they hear that schools are closed because of norovirus, because that happens all the time,” Malley said. “It shouldn’t trigger people into [thinking of] the school closures of COVID and other things which, of course, are still fresh on many people’s minds.”&lt;/p&gt;

The list includes not only colds and flu but also norovirus — a highly infectious cause of vomiting and diarrhea. Norovirus cases have generally been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html#cdc_tools_technologies_features-nrevss-dashboard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trending up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;trending up&lt;/a&gt; in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here are three seasonal respiratory viruses that experts are keeping an eye on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts are closely watching flu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last flu season was bad, with the overall flu hospitalization rate the highest since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. With the addition of a late-reported case, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-deaths-children-cdc-e79b1e4169d629ad4bc1095d95d82110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:child flu deaths;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;child flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; reached 288, the worst recorded for regular U.S. flu season and the same number seen in the 2009-2010 flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This season's first pediatric flu death was reported this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are reasons to fear this winter might be bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One type of flu virus — called A H3N2 — historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people.

Even more concerning, 89% of the H3N2 infections analyzed were a new version — known as the subclade K variant — that differs from the strain in this year’s flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu seasons often don't peak until around February, so it's too early to know how big a problem that mismatch will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual vaccination, and public health experts say it’s not too late. About 42% of U.S. adults and 41% of children have gotten flu shots this season, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The shots may not prevent all symptoms but they can prevent many infections from becoming severe. That appears to be true for this year’s shot, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preliminary U.K. analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;preliminary U.K. analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;RSV usually peaks soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rsv-surge-shots-newborns-c0183aa026f968807401d6f5ddf44954" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Respiratory syncytial virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus&lt;/a&gt; is a common cause of cold-like symptoms. But it can be dangerous for infants and the elderly, and is known for filling hospitals with wheezing babies every fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;RSV seasons typically peak by December or January, but the season seems to be starting later than usual reported cases so far have been relatively low, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s likely more RSV is coming, said Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious diseases expert at Duke University, in an email. And, indeed, Friday’s CDC update showed signs that infections are increasing in the South and in mid-Atlantic states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But relatively new vaccines may be helping. In 2023, the government licensed new RSV vaccines for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rsv-vaccine-pregnant-women-babies-a0f9dfec9930b55a134fe493c73fc389" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnant women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rsv-vaccine-respiratory-virus-60a8b859c692a593b652f68ff25738be" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;older people&lt;/a&gt;, and injections of laboratory-made versions of antibodies &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rsv-babies-drug-cdc-astrazeneca-sanofi-shot-c03b72aaa51e59176cfa3feb3ceac06c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:for infants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;for infants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Perhaps, glass half full, we’re cumulatively getting more people slowly vaccinated against RSV,” Wolfe said. “And because the virus mutates far less quickly than flu or COVID, the one vaccine you might have had as an older adult two or three years ago is likely still quite effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As of October, about 41% of Americans 75 and older have been vaccinated, and about 40% of infants were reported to be protected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsvvaxview/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Trump administration, which has appointed vaccine skeptics to public health leadership and advisory positions, this week &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rsv-drugs-fda-kennedy-safety-vaccines-children-d0ac709d04029d3a331a783409dd2ccb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:opened a review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;opened a review&lt;/a&gt; of the two injectable drugs used to protect babies and toddlers despite no signs of safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;COVID-19 indicators are down from a summer peak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;COVID-19 activity right now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_3-emergency-department-visits-for-viral-respiratory-illness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is relatively low;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;is relatively low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This week, the CDC published &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7440a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7440a1_w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; showing the COVID-19 vaccine can keep kids from developing a severe illness. Among children nine months to 4 years, the shots were 76% effective against symptoms severe enough to send a child to a hospital ER or urgent care center, the agency found. Among kids five to 17 years, it was 56% effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871947/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; also found the shots are safe and effective for children. But the report comes out after Trump administration officials stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children, and as anti-vaccine advocates are petitioning the government to revoke licenses for the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Few people are getting the shot this year. About 7% of children and 15% of adults have gotten this season's version of COVID-19 vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In October, the agency &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-covid19-shots-b0183766e56b5d0e948904172193c891" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stopped recommending;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stopped recommending&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 shots for anyone, leaving the choice up to patients.

                &lt;p&gt;With winter right around the corner, some of you might be thinking about taking a trip to your local tanning bed. But be warned, a study out this week finds these devices can be especially harmful to your skin, even beyond natural Sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Northwestern University and the University of California, San Francisco, examined the medical records of tanning bed users. These users not only had a higher risk of melanoma compared to non-users, they also tended to have more cancer and cancer-related mutations in parts of the body not typically touched by the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“To me, the evidence is clear. Tanning beds represent a uniquely dangerous exposure when it comes to skin cancer,” study researcher Alan Hunter Shain, a cancer biologist at UCSF, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A unique risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;UV (ultraviolet) radiation is the primary risk factor of skin cancer, including melanoma. And while most cases are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/skin-cancer/sun-safety/index.html"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to the UV exposure we get from the Sun, tanning beds pose a clear risk as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The tanning bed industry has long argued that these beds are no more dangerous to our skin than the Sun. Shain notes, however, that they can provide intense bouts of UV exposure at all times of the year and to any part of the body. Some of the authors had also noticed a rise of unusual skin cancer cases in their practice, such as relatively young people coming down with multiple melanomas—cases they suspected were linked to tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To better quantify the risks of tanning beds, the researchers analyzed medical records data from around 3,000 tanning bed users and compared them to similar people matched in age with no such history. In a separate experiment, they genetically sequenced skin cells taken from tanning bed users and controls.&lt;/p&gt;

And even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like a family history of skin cancer, tanning bed use was still associated with a nearly threefold increase of melanoma. This added risk was dose-dependent, meaning that people who reported using tanning beds more had a greater likelihood of melanoma compared to others. And they were more likely to have melanomas in body parts rarely seen by the Sun, such as the buttocks and lower back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s genetic analysis also revealed some unusual and worrying patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“In our study, we saw tanning bed users in their 30s and 40s with more mutations in their skin cells than people in their 70s and 80s from the general population,” Swain said. “They had effectively accumulated a lifetime’s worth of UV-induced damage by age 30 because of continuous, year-round access to artificial UV radiation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady4878"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do about tanning beds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given these risks, tanning beds warrant increased regulation, particularly for younger people not up to speed on the danger, the authors argue. Groups like the World Health Organization have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/17-03-2005-the-world-health-organization-recommends-that-no-person-under-18-should-use-a-sunbed"&gt;long stated&lt;/a&gt; that no one under 18 should be allowed to use tanning beds, and some countries have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9221787/"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; their use among minors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Many of the patients dealing with the consequences of tanning bed usage were primarily exposed as minors and hence may not have had the maturity or wisdom to make optimal decisions regarding their health,” study author Pedram Gerami, a professor of skin cancer research at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the very least, there should be more education about the threat posed by these devices. Gerami notes that it might take as little as ten uses of a tanning bed to more than double your lifetime risk of melanoma, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Skin cancer in general is estimated to kill 11,000 Americans a year, with over 8,000 caused by &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/melan.html"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Even those who may not die from the disease may have to deal with significant morbidity and emotional distress,” Gerami said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team plans to continue investigating how tanning beds can shape a person’s cancer risk. Since these beds can emit unusual blends of UV radiation not naturally created by the Sun, they might cause uniquely damaging mutations as well, Shain says. And it’s a possibility they’re now actively studying.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, downing an energy drink can feel like refueling your battery. But with too much, that jolt can turn into a catastrophic surge that fries the wiring and blows a fuse. That was the unfortunate and alarming case for a man in the UK several years ago, according to &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/12/e267441"&gt;a case report&lt;/a&gt; this week in BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, who was in his 50s and otherwise healthy, showed up at a hospital after the entire left side of his body abruptly went numb and he was left with clumsy, uncoordinated muscle movements (ataxia). His blood pressure was astonishingly high, at 254/150 mm Hg. For context, a normal reading is under 120/80, while anything over 180/120 is considered a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24470-hypertensive-crisis"&gt;hypertensive crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which is a medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had suffered a mild stroke, and his extremely high blood pressure was an obvious factor. But why his blood pressure had reached stratospheric heights was far less obvious to his doctors, according to the retrospective case report written by Martha Coyle and Sunil Munshi of Nottingham University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon examining the man, the doctors described him as fit and healthy. He didn’t smoke, drink, or use any drugs. His blood work was all completely normal. His cholesterol, blood sugar levels, markers for kidney and liver function—everything from routine tests came back normal. Specialized tests for things like autoimmune and clotting disorders were also negative. Heart tests found no problems. Urine tests and abdominal scans found no problems with his other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power surge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a computed tomography (CT) scan of his head found evidence of spasms in arteries in his brain, which are strongly linked to high blood pressure. And magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found an infarct (dead tissue) in his thalamus, a central, deep part of the brain, which, among many critical functions, relays sensory and motor signals. In all, it seemed his spasming arteries had cut off blood supply to this part of his brain, causing his stroke, subsequent numbness, and ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Is your child thinking about becoming a vegetarian or vegan? Research this week shows the potential benefits—and perils—for kids who stick to these diets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the scientific literature on these diets for children. They found that kids on plant-based diets tended to consume more of certain important nutrients like fiber, while possibly having better heart health. At the same time, however, they were more likely to become deficient in other nutrients like vitamin B-12 and iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for careful dietary planning and supplementation in lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan children,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2025.2572983"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Pros and cons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers (Australia, Italy, and the U.S.) analyzed data from 59 studies that collectively involved 48,626 participants under the age of 18. These studies compared the nutritional and health outcomes of children on a typical omnivore, vegan, or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, the latter allowing people to have some dairy or egg but no meat.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Vegetarian and vegan children consumed more fiber, iron, folate, vitamin C, and magnesium on average compared to omnivores, the researchers found, and they ate fewer calories in general. They also had lower levels of total and LDL cholesterol (aka, the “bad” kind) and were leaner on average.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But these kids also tended to have less protein, fat, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc in their diets. Vegan children in particular had very low calcium intake. Vegetarian children were also slightly shorter than omnivores, while vegans had “shorter stature.” And though these children on average still had most of their nutritional needs fulfilled, vegetarians had a greater risk of iron deficiency and anemia, while vegans had a greater risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The need for careful dieting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results shouldn’t necessarily scare kids or their families away from pursuing a plant-based diet, the researchers say. And other research has shown that well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822309007007"&gt;provide&lt;/a&gt; adequate nutrition. For both kids and &lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(25)00042-5/fulltext"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s important to keep an eye on and fill in any potential nutritional gaps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that a balanced approach is essential, with families paying close attention to certain nutrients—particularly vitamin B12, calcium, iodine, iron and zinc—to ensure their children get everything they need to thrive,” said study author Wolfgang Marx, a researcher at the Food &amp;amp; Mood Center at Deakin University in Australia, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-based-diets-children-largest-kind.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the study’s publisher.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

After having her daughter, she was determined to get healthy - both for herself and her child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then she saw an Oprah special about GLP-1 inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought, "Yes, I'm going to give this a try,"' Shaum said. 'It genuinely changed my life in a way I never expected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the medication came with one major hurdle: the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, she was paying around $300 a month using her HSA account. Now, her local pharmacy offers her three months-worth of semaglutide for $300 - still entirely out of pocket, with no help from insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madi Shaum (pictured), a St George mom who works as a social media strategist, started taking semaglutide a little over a year ago after struggling with her weight for most of her life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shaum had tried 'every fad diet imaginable,' she said, but nothing stuck. After having her daughter, she was determined to get healthy - both for herself and her child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, to make sure she could afford it, the busy mom took on three extra jobs, often clocking 12-hour days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just had to find a way. Anyone who wants to do this should be able to,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her most lucrative side gig is data annotation, which involves training artificial intelligence systems - a meticulous process that pays $25 to $40 an hour once you're accepted. 'It's tedious, but it adds up,' she told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, because Shaum has more than 1,000 followers on TikTok, she was able to become an affiliate for TikTok Shop, filming product videos that earn her commission when viewers buy through her links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some companies give 5 percent, others 10 percent plus bonuses. It depends,' she said. Holiday months like November and December are especially profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using her marketing and graphic-design background, she also creates digital poster designs and sells them as instant downloads on Etsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's unlimited opportunity - posters, wedding invitations, birthday cards. If you find the right niche, it can bring in good money.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between her full-time 8am-to-5pm job and her side hustles, Shaum often spends up to four extra hours a day earning the money she needs for her medication. She says that, over the last 16 months, she's earned around $5,000 from her side jobs alone..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wakes up before sunrise - and before her husband and daughter - to squeeze in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After my daughter goes to bed, I try to relax,' she said. 'But my biggest sacrifice has definitely been my time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shaum has lost 40lbs since starting to take semaglutide 16 months ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since starting semaglutide, Shaum has lost nearly 40lbs over 16 months after years of barely being able to lose even 5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the biggest change for her is not the number on the scale - it's the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The food noise is gone,' she explained. 'I'm not constantly thinking about what to eat next. I can focus on hitting my protein and calorie goals without that overwhelming urge to just keep eating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has more energy, feels happier and can keep up with friends and family in a way she never could before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Online, Shaum has found a community of others also turning to side hustles to pay for the pricey medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know at least two of my TikTok mutuals who also do TikTok Shop just to afford their GLP-1s,' she told the Daily Mail. 'A lot of people want to start, but they just can't find the extra money.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some, she's heard, pay up to $600 a month for brand-name medications like Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her advice for anyone considering it: 'If you've been thinking about it - do it. It's changed everything for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 40.8 million Americans are taking some form of GLP-1 inhibitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The three most popular GLP-1 inhibitor drugs - Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro - can range from around $900 to $1,400 per month on average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the approximately 40.8 million Americans taking some form of GLP-1 inhibitor, the drug is no doubt a financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three most popular GLP-1 drugs - Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro - can range from around $900 to $1,400 per month on average, depending on the medication, the dose and whether a user has insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, cost has seemingly not deterred weight-loss drug users, as a new &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/#:~:text=About%20one%20in%20eight%20adults%20(12%25)%20say,a%20new%20KFF%20Health%20Tracking%20Poll%20finds."&gt;report from November&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 12 percent of adults - about one in eight - are currently taking a GLP-1 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most adults who have taken these drugs say their insurance covered at least part of the cost, but about 27 percent of people with insurance still have to pay the full price themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cost is also a major reason people stop using these medications, with 14 percent saying they quit because they couldn't afford them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most users (76 percent) got the drugs from their doctor, while smaller numbers got them online (17 percent) or from medical spas (9 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A Food and Drug Administration panel of health experts convened Wednesday to discuss and promote the health benefits of testosterone treatments for men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FDA Commissioner Martin Makary told&lt;em&gt; Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt; that low testosterone is believed to be associated with symptoms in roughly one-third of men who have it, though he said the evidence and data are not fully defined. Symptoms can include "reduction in mood and vitality," Makary said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Speaking to NPR's Steve Inskeep, Makary discussed why the FDA wants to reconsider medical access to testosterone and the stigma associated with its use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to the full conversation by clicking the blue play button above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The radio version of this story was edited by Adam Bearne and produced by Lilly Quiroz.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Finding the perfect early screening test for cancer remains a persistent challenge for the health industry. But new findings suggest that blood tests still being assessed are showing promising results when it comes to detecting cancers at earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-cancer early detection tests are blood tests that look for DNA fragments that cancers can release into the bloodstream. The tests are abbreviated as MCED.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These blood tests are looking for multiple different types of cancer in the blood at the same time,” said Dr. Rebecca Kaltman, medical director of the Inova Saville Cancer Screening and Prevention Center at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only five tests designed to detect early stage cancer have been approved by the U.S. Preventative Task Force: mammograms for breast cancer, colonoscopies for colon cancer, Pap smears for cervical cancer, prostate-specific antigens, or PSA tests for prostate cancer, and low-dose CT scans for lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the other 100 or so cancers — including pancreatic, liver, ovarian and others — don’t have reliable scanning tests, they are often found by the time they have spread and are more difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show approximately 70% of cancer deaths result from types of cancer that do not have an early screening test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 800 participants from Schar were enrolled in the national Pathfinder II study of the &lt;a href="https://www.galleri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Galleri&lt;/a&gt; test, which is made by Grail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar MCED test, &lt;a href="https://www.cancerguard.com/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=FY25_ES_CANCERGUARD_DTC_AWA_DIAGNOSIS_X_SEMGOOG_BRN_MUL&amp;amp;utm_id=23048873689&amp;amp;utm_term=exact%20sciences%20cancerguard&amp;amp;utm_content=188864902507&amp;amp;utm_aud=e&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23048873689&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAABBYaYz55WgTeKxGOAB12mU9nejKVB&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAl-_JBhBjEiwAn3rN7d0rs6r-sNxhbwUOwAXbSpir9JAAWcF-ZDftxr5Z1KV0MDxE7w7ifBoCNQcQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cancerguard,&lt;/a&gt; is also seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That test is made by Exact Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Are the tests accurate? What about false positives?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a patient has an MCED test, “It will come back as either positive or negative, and if it’s positive it will say a cancer signal was detected,” Kaltman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test generally suggests one or two sites from which the cancer may be originating, which will guide further follow-up testing to determine whether a positive finding is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with other early screening methods, a positive result does not mean a person has cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When a mammogram is done and there’s concern about it, the vast majority of the time that concern ends up not being cancer,” Kaltman said. “About 15 to 30% of time, depending on the literature that you see, it will be cancer — so that’s what we call the positive predictive value of the test.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, in clinical trials, “Galleri had a 62% chance of when it came back positive, that it was actually diagnosing a cancer,” Kaltman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if an MCED does come back negative, that doesn’t mean a person doesn’t have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important that anybody who has this test undergoes routine screening — colonoscopy, age-appropriate mammography, et cetera,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future clinical trials and research, likely before FDA approval, will look at the effects of test errors, as well as whether MCEDs actually help patients live longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you have a false positive, or something comes back positive that we can’t clarify, that can cause a lot of anxiety,” Kaltman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the FDA-approved prostate cancer test, “We were picking up a lot of cancers that ended up probably not impacting somebody’s longevity. And individuals were subjected to invasive surgery with complications that they might not have had to go through, because it wasn’t going to impact their longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaltman said current clinical studies are evaluating how valuable MCEDs are in extending people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are we catching cancers that we need to catch early — the ones that are aggressive and need to be detected early, to have better outcomes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;The problem, the experts said, is that nobody has been listening to men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For too long, hormone therapy has been inaccessible for cisgender men who need it — or so said clinicians, professors and a pharmaceutical CEO gathered this week by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Testosterone, a controlled substance, should be deregulated and patients should be able to access it at pharmacies without stigma, they said. Low testosterone in men is not just a cosmetic issue, they claimed — it’s an American health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts at Wednesday’s FDA panel presented a unified and mostly rosy view of testosterone, praising it as the answer to common ailments that follow men as they age: weight gain, loss of muscle mass and exhaustion. Their need for more testosterone is dire, the panel claimed, to prevent disease and premature death. Millions of men are at risk of low testosterone and aren’t being screened for it, they said. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;Not all medical experts agree on these broad claims, and some criticized the FDA panel for lacking key context about the risks of taking testosterone. Regardless, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary made it clear that the agency is interested in revisiting testosterone’s current label as a drug with a higher risk of abuse and physical dependence. With that label comes restrictions on refills&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and penalties for possessing it without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, transgender rights advocates and Democratic members of Congress have &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/09/testosterone-restrictions-biden-administration-markey-warren/"&gt;asked federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to loosen these restrictions, which would make it easier for trans people to access the hormone as part of &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/06/everything-to-know-about-gender-affirming-care/"&gt;gender-affirming care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Wednesday’s panel was clear in its singular focus: how testosterone could improve cisgender men’s health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone therapy is safe, effective, and preventive,” said Dr. Helen Bernie, an associate professor of urology at Indiana University, where she directs the school’s male sexual and reproductive medicine program. “Testosterone is still regulated as if it were a dangerous performance-enhancing drug. … Because of this outdated classification, many physicians fear prescribing it or even screening for it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another panel expert — Abe Morgentaler, a Blavatnik faculty fellow in health and longevity at Harvard University — lamented that “the demonization of testosterone is a tragedy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In what other area of medicine does one get to hear your patients tell you that they have improved mood, vigor, sexuality — and then to hear on a regular basis, ‘Finally, I feel like myself again?’” he said at the FDA’s panel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To some transgender men, such statements coming from an event organized by the Trump administration are laughable. The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; has denounced hormone replacement therapy — when used by trans people — as part of an effort to “eradicate the biological reality of sex.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But cisgender people rely on hormone therapy, too. And some men clearly want more of it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems like these officials know quite well how important it is for people to have easy access to medications that improve their health and improve their lives,” said Zan Lussier, a 56-year-old transgender man living in Washington state. “It absolutely is gender-affirming care for cis men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lussier has been on testosterone since March 1999. Back then, he couldn’t just go directly to his general practitioner and say what he needed. It took time to find a medical professional willing to prescribe him testosterone and even then, it was kept out of his medical records. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to what some of us have been dealing with since the late ’90s,” he said. “But it’s much easier for them. There were not ‘Hims’ commercials in 1999.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many transmasculine and nonbinary people take testosterone to alleviate the distress of gender dysphoria, which can cause serious mental health problems. Lately, their access has been threatened because of politics. Late this summer, Lussier watched as a local clinic stopped providing gender-affirming care to trans youth as a result of funding threats from the federal government. Clinics &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/least-21-hospitals-ended-restricted-trans-care-minors-january-rcna226640"&gt;across the country&lt;/a&gt; have followed suit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday’s panel, Shalin Shah, CEO of Marius Pharmaceuticals, said that the Department of Health and Human Services should consider testosterone therapy an essential health benefit to reduce barriers to access. The Trump administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/new-rule-proposes-changes-to-aca-coverage-of-gender-affirming-care-potentially-increasing-costs-for-consumers/"&gt;finalized a rule&lt;/a&gt; barring insurers from &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/04/trump-trans-health-care-benefits-costs/"&gt;covering gender-affirming care&lt;/a&gt; as an essential health benefit — meaning trans people’s costs for the same treatments would be higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine doctor based in Omaha, Nebraska, regularly prescribes testosterone to both his cis and trans patients. The benefits are often the same for cis and trans men, including improved overall well-being, better mental health and physique, and increased libido. For trans men, benefits also include developing a deeper voice, growing facial hair and ending the menstrual cycle, which alleviate the stress of gender dysphoria. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Removing the Schedule 3 label for testosterone makes sense, Dworak said. A false sense of fear still lingers around its use as a medication, he said, just as some patients and providers were scared away in the early 2000s from &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/10/fda-black-box-warning-menopause-estrogen-treatments/"&gt;using estrogen to treat menopausal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. But although he agrees with much of the FDA panel’s discussion, he was struck by who was left out of the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If it is legit here, why is it any less legitimate for gender-expansive people? If it’s good for cis men, why is it bad for trans men?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;


  



&lt;p&gt;When discussing testosterone for trans people, the tone is completely different, Dworak said; the federal government is questioning the legitimacy of gender-affirming care, taking down research, and stigmatizing the community. But it’s the exact same medicine, he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m struck by the hypocrisy and the contradictions,” he said. “You can’t recognize this value for one group of people while simultaneously questioning or frankly demonizing that value for another group of people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, not all experts agree about the benefits.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University Medical Center, criticized the FDA panel for glossing over known risks of testosterone treatment for men — including high blood pressure and a higher likelihood of blood clots.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Panelists claimed that testosterone would prevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis, despite a stunning lack of evidence in support of these claims,” she said in a statement as director of PharmedOut, a research project on the effects of pharmaceutical marketing. Panelists noted that low testosterone is associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, she said — but they failed to mention that these conditions may decrease testosterone levels, not the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashton Colby, a 33-year-old trans man living near Columbus, Ohio, can feel it when he misses his weekly dose of testosterone. In the past, he’s had to go without it for months at a time due to a lack of insurance. He lost muscle mass, body acne came back, his period came back, and his mental health was severely impacted.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He felt depressed. That’s why restrictions on trans people’s access to hormones and gender-affirming care freak him out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colby’s primary care provider, a nurse practitioner, measures the testosterone levels in his blood a few times a year. The desired range is the same for him as it is for cisgender men. If his levels drop below that, they raise his dose. To him, there is no difference between the medical care that he gets and what cisgender men get — except that his care has been under attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a real empathy moment that could be had here for these folks,” said Lussier, the trans man living in Washington state. Many trans people utilizing gender-affirming care have to deal with the same issues that experts on the FDA panel raised for cisgender men: like medical gatekeepers and uncomfortable interactions with pharmacists. But they go through with it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because, as they said, this is the only way I can feel like myself. Without testosterone, I am not who I am,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you've never know it, because he looked so well. That's why we call hypertension the silent killer," said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults&lt;/a&gt; is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness," Munshi said. "He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man's blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day," Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) "Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups," Coyle said. "This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also r&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=Daily%20Caffeine%20Consumption%20for%20Most,generally%20associated%20with%20negative%20effects." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;ecommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man's blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I obviously wasn't aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself," the man told his doctors. "(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combinations of ingredients 'cause havoc'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just high levels of caffeine. Today's energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone," he said. "They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes, which leads to heart damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots," he said. "Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation," he said." Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, "especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent," he added. "We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
