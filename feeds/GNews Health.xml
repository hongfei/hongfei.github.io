She was scratched in February - and died four months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'She and dad were on a holiday in Morocco and they were on a private beach next to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a puppy underneath mum's sunbed and it scratched her leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was no blood and no evidence of the dog being unwell.

We went to Florida as a family and she went fishing with my dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in June she came down with this horrendous headache.

She was hallucinating and had a fear of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She couldn't swallow. She was choking on her own saliva. So doctors put her in an induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't until over a week later that she was diagnosed with rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's only one outcome for rabies once symptoms develop and it's death every time. So we had to turn off her life support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family later found out that it normally takes a few months for rabies symptoms to show - but the deadly disease can incubate for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Robyn wants to spread awareness for rabies - and help stop it at the source via a charity mission in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two has launched a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-mum-fighting-rabies-in-cambodia"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; and is appealing for help from the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'This is something I need to do. If I can save even one life through this work, or spare one family from going through the pain we have experienced, then it will be turning a terrible negative into something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm determined to transform my grief into action - helping vaccinate dogs, support surveillance efforts, and deliver life-saving lessons in schools.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:29:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPTG1oV2hyMWMwdm1uWGZ4dkxvaXVPeFBrdXBRVzd4OWRiSWxiTklFZDg5eDdnb1VMNlpKX3VRSF9YTkFaTUV6OFJ2cS1xMG9xZXNWbHMtZnlWNlFTOHFKSHhfc2xUcWFvVldMVmVHc2ctclhXSFZDOGhnd3JHbW9xd1h5SV9pOHJEaW1Fa3p3YUJGOHhOYkJWMWFBLXdKaXNRQWdsWUNkTUZoNEdYQk5rODJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTE40djBKTndSLU9kTGtZRXlyWTc5NElrWjR4OTNfaU1Sa28wdEwyM2RWMzFiR3RERDk1dVljVmVlQmVtQ3VNWHQwZzNpRHI3cl95akxIaFhkeEZNaTNyOGYyZUhIZEpfYm5mOEdmcTd1S2VwQ0hRdWlzQ0R5MWYybnE2WXd5UUZoWUl6VkcxbHNTT2piMFNxalEwQlV2RFdEQVEzRUd5cWNUdW8wOWE5d2dFQUlJRS0zQQ</guid></item><item><title>Serious OT: mods please leave. - 247Sports</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious OT: mods please leave.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;247Sports&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>247Sports</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 23:05:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3</guid></item><item><title>可能是血栓迹象的无声症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood’s ability to clot after a cut or injury is an important defense mechanism to keep you from bleeding too much.

An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die from blood clot complications annually, making this an important health issue to be aware of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Awareness of blood clot symptoms is critically important because early recognition can be life-saving,” says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/jonathan-parsons-md-4884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Recognizing symptoms early allows for prompt medical treatment.” That can help lower the risk of permanent damage to organs or tissues, he points out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the problem: Not all symptoms of blood clots are obvious, and one in particular can be easily mistaken for other, much less severe health issues. Here’s what doctors want you to keep in mind about this symptom, why it can be confused with other things and when to take action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Serious Blood Clots Happen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go over the symptom, it’s important to first go over how blood clots can become serious. Blood clots that happen spontaneously usually start in the legs, explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Christopher Yi, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Christopher Yi, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “They aren’t life-threatening in themselves, but they occasionally dislodge and go to the lungs,” he says. This is called a pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-a1c-levels-according-to-endocrinologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung and blocks blood flow to part of the lung, Dr. Yi explains. There, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs, low oxygen levels in your blood, and damage to other organs in your body (from not getting enough oxygen), he says, adding, “This can be life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Silent Sign of Blood Clots To Know About, According to a Vascular Surgeon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to that silent symptom: Shortness of breath is common with pulmonary embolisms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shortness of breath is a hallmark symptom of pulmonary embolism because of how the condition affects the lungs and oxygen delivery,” Dr. Parson says. “The blocked artery prevents blood from reaching parts of the lung, so oxygen can't be absorbed into the bloodstream efficiently, resulting in shortness of breath.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This blockage usually comes on suddenly, so the body doesn’t have time to compensate for the lower-than-usual oxygen, he explains.

But doctors say there are a few key differences between “regular” shortness of breath and feeling breathless due to a blood clot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Standard shortness of breath usually comes with exercise or activity,” Dr. Yi says. “With a blood clot, there is a sudden onset of shortness of breath where you feel like you can’t catch your breath.” You may also start breathing faster than usual, he explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with coming on hard and fast, shortness of breath from a blood clot tends to get worse with exertion or taking deep breaths, according to Dr. Parson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1264350/jenniferlarson/what-does-an-asthma-attack-feel-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Signs of a Blood Clot and What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sudden shortness of breath alone should raise concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism, there are other blood clot symptoms doctors warn should be on your radar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain (it usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A faster-than-usual heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughing, including coughing up blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very low blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling lightheaded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to write these signs off if you have one or two that can be explained away as something more minor. But doctors stress the importance of taking these seriously if you or someone around you has them. “If someone experiences these symptoms, immediate medical attention is critical,” Dr. Parsons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/everyday-activity-thats-good-for-your-core-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 27, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 20:48:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq</guid></item><item><title>人类大脑在疫情中迅速老化，不仅仅是病毒- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUk9GX1BCemxQY2NhTWJyb3g3Ykh4ZDlFQ1pQeFNQSWltSE5hV3ZQckRpSHJud2tpUmp6STZoRjhDWE5UbkZLR2JlcUZYVlQ0LTFPWndLMjd6S1RPdFVFbFVidDd2cUNDVlpLRldFUXd0UGE0bTl6cTU0eXpIM1pWN0xwYlRxTW96UlVDYk5IVzEwRko4TDhGekJnSUpGYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic may have left a significant mark on our brains, even if we didn't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-covid-looks-scarily-like-old-age-in-the-human-brain-study-finds"&gt;Fatal cases&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 look scarily like old age &lt;/span&gt;in the brain&lt;span&gt;, and now, new research suggests that the mental, social, and financial stresses of the pandemic may have aged our brains as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham trained an AI model to recognize healthy aging in the brain, using the data of more than 15,000 adults in the UK Biobank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The algorithm was then used to analyze the brain ages of two groups: one that had brain scans taken before the pandemic and another that had brain scans taken both before and during the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the pandemic, the average human brain aged five and a half months faster than it did before 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What surprised me most was that even people who hadn't had COVID showed significant increases in brain aging rates," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; neurologist Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad from Nottingham, who led the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is that those changes may be reversible. The study only analyzed brain scans from two time points, which means that there may have been neurological recovery in the years that followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dorothee Auer from Nottingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, just because a person's brain may have aged at a faster rate during the pandemic, doesn't mean their cognitive function was necessarily impacted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, the only individuals in the study who showed decreased cognitive performance were those who were directly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, the findings suggest that a major life event like a pandemic can have a significant impact on the brain, even if you don't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the first few years of the global pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;millions of humans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; died, and billions more dealt with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-than-death-covid-has-unleashed-a-tidal-wave-of-grief-on-america"&gt;&lt;span&gt;tidal wave of grief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-okay-to-feel-lonely-right-now-here-s-how-to-recognise-the-symptoms"&gt;&lt;span&gt;loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-stressed-before-you-get-covid-may-increase-your-odds-of-developing-long-covid"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic-depression-has-persisted-even-after-lockdowns-have-eased"&gt;&lt;span&gt;financial stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-is-doing-something-to-our-sleep-and-even-to-our-dreams"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research found teenagers were particularly affected by the global crisis, with the adolescent brain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lockdowns-did-something-to-teen-brains-and-we-need-to-talk-about-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;showing concerning signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of accelerated aging after 2020,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brains-of-teenagers-look-disturbingly-different-after-lockdown"&gt;&lt;span&gt;similar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span&gt; teens experiencing violence, neglect, or family dysfunction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168917" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg" alt="Corticol Thinning" class="size-full wp-image-168917" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans-600x326.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show accelerated brain maturation in teenagers following the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with more pronounced effects visible in female subjects.

But the current study among adults found that male brains were more vulnerable to both grey and white matter changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of accelerated aging were also particularly evident among older people and among socially or economically disadvantaged groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/social-isolation-actually-changes-our-brain-structure-neuroimaging-reveals"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that social isolation can change the structure of the brain, and poverty is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both could be factors leading to structural changes in the brain, but it's important to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping, long-term studies using brain scans can provide scientists with useful clues as to how major life events, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-scans-reveal-a-massive-surge-of-connectivity-when-babies-are-born"&gt;birth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-kids-linked-to-younger-looking-brains-later-in-life-study-finds"&gt;parenthood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-structural-brain-wide-changes-during-menstruation"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, might be impacting our central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without closer research, it's impossible&lt;span&gt; to say why these brain regions are changing, or what impact the changes might have on cognitive function, or our behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;concludes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Auer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are rich in fiber, omega-3s, and antioxidants, offering many heart and digestive health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They may interact with medications for blood pressure, diabetes, and clotting by amplifying their effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your health care professional before adding chia to your diet if you're on meds, and start with small amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite their tiny size, chia seeds pack a powerful, nutrient-rich punch. They provide a boost of vitamins, minerals, healthy fat and fiber to whatever food they’re paired with—whether in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8056553/chia-seed-recipes-that-arent-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie bowl&lt;/a&gt;, pancakes or oatmeal bars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because chia provides a good plant source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels and quash inflammation, among many other benefits. Chia seeds are also a good source of antioxidants, which protect against cellular damage linked to chronic disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are also high in soluble fiber and form a gel-like substance when they come in contact with liquid—that’s why &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268739/berry-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/a&gt; is so creamy. Due to their fiber content—1 ounce contains 10 grams of fiber—chia seeds may help increase satiety, lower LDL cholesterol and improve regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these tiny seeds have a bit of a sinister secret: Despite being as good-for-you as they are, chia seeds may also interact with certain medications, affecting their potency and effectiveness.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The antioxidants and peptides found in chia seeds may help act like a natural ACE inhibitor (a common class of blood-pressure-lowering drugs) to decrease blood pressure and promote heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s a perk on its own, but eating chia seeds while taking antihypertensive medications could decrease your blood pressure more than expected. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds may have antiplatelet properties, which prevent clots from entering the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Good news for reducing your risk for heart attack and stroke, but this can be too much if you’re also being treated with blood thinners, which may increase the risk for bleeding. “If you are taking an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet, use caution,” says pharmacist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-smith-jr-pharmd001/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ronald Smith, Pharm.D., RPh&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a smart choice if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, as their fiber helps slow down digestion. There’s evidence that chia may help reduce the rise in blood sugar that occurs after eating, and they may also have the potential to be used in diabetes treatment due to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
However, if you’re taking medication to treat diabetes, such as insulin, watch how your blood sugar responds to meals and snacks containing chia, since chia could lower your blood sugar too much. “If you’re new to chia seeds and are on insulin, consult your physician, as you may need to adjust your dosage,” says &lt;a href="https://www.freshmednyc.com/dr-robert-graham-integrative-medicine-nyc" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robert Graham, M.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;. a board-certified internal and integrative medicine physician and founder of Fresh Medicine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, because chia seeds have potential blood-pressure-lowering, antiplatelet and blood-sugar-reducing properties, there may be additive effects between chia and the medications that treat these conditions. In other words, your blood pressure or blood sugar may dip too low when you combine the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of medication absorption, it’s important to remember that chia is notably high in fiber. In some instances, you may get more fiber from eating chia than from taking a serving of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-might-need-a-fiber-supplement-8678377" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how much chia you’re eating. And fiber can slow down the absorption of certain medications. If you routinely eat a lot of chia, ask your provider if you should space out the time between eating chia and taking your medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are taking any of the above medications and want to incorporate chia seeds into your diet, there are a few things to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First and foremost, consult with your health care professional when making any significant dietary changes, including taking supplements. You can also talk to your local pharmacist about any food-medication interactions you might run into on your current prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or supplements. Don’t be shy about asking if chia seeds are safe for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have never eaten chia seeds before or haven't eaten them since starting any of the above medications, Graham recommends “starting low and going slow.” Consume a small amount of chia seed and gradually increase your intake to a level you can tolerate with no issues. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a nutrient-packed food rich in omega-3s, fiber and antioxidants. They also may interact with some medications, specifically those prescribed for high blood pressure, other cardiovascular conditions (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) and diabetes. If you are being treated for those health conditions, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should avoid chia seeds. But talk to a health care professional about making chia seeds part of your diet; they may want to monitor you for any interactions or side effects.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; revealed that everyone has their own unique response to insulin, challenging how the condition has traditionally been diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research takes a deep dive into the molecular makeup of muscle tissue and shows that insulin sensitivity isn’t as black and white as once believed. Instead, it's more like a spectrum—with distinct molecular fingerprints that could change the way we detect, predict, and manage diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rethinking_a_global_health_crisis"&gt;Rethinking a Global Health Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 million people live with type 2 diabetes around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is often diagnosed by elevated blood sugar levels or poor responses to insulin. But now, thanks to new technology, scientists are realizing that the disease is far more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The proteome and phosphoproteome of human skeletal muscle are critical determinants of whole-body insulin sensitivity (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Denmark, Sweden, and beyond worked together to examine the underlying differences in how people respond to insulin. Instead of just separating people into "healthy" or "diabetic," they found that individuals show a wide range of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-protein-discovery-could-replace-insulin-for-diabetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;—even among those with similar diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found huge variation in insulin sensitivity, even among people considered healthy and among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes," said Associate Professor Atul Deshmukh from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen. "There are even some individuals living with type 2 diabetes who respond better to insulin than healthy individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that your body’s insulin response is much more personal than we thought. And this variation could explain why some people develop complications while others do not—even if they share the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="studying_muscle_at_the_molecular_level"&gt;Studying Muscle at the Molecular Level&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, the researchers looked closely at muscle tissue, a key site for insulin activity. Using a technology called mass spectrometry-based proteomics, they studied over 120 people. This allowed them to examine thousands of proteins and phosphorylation sites in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mechanical-pump-regenerates-heart-muscle-at-6x-the-normal-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on two groups: one with type 2 diabetes and another with normal &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/zinc-levels-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;. Each group underwent detailed testing, including the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp—the gold standard method for measuring insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found striking results. Some people with type 2 diabetes showed better insulin sensitivity than those considered healthy. This was true even after accounting for factors like fasting glucose and HbA1c, common blood sugar markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Proteomic signature of insulin-sensitive and -resistant skeletal muscle (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding clear-cut differences, the study revealed a 36-fold range in insulin sensitivity. In simple terms, no two bodies responded to insulin the same way. Even within the diabetic group, the range was massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this, researchers analyzed protein and phosphoprotein levels in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/researchers-harness-the-power-of-bacteria-to-regenerate-muscle-tissue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the molecular landscape of skeletal muscle plays a huge role in how your body handles insulin. Certain proteins consistently matched higher or lower insulin sensitivity. These changes could act as early warning signs long before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="building_the_future_of_personalized_diabetes_care"&gt;Building the Future of Personalized Diabetes Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Krook, a professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and co-lead author, believes these results lay the groundwork for personalized treatment. "By learning more about the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we’re building the foundation for precision medicine in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/widely-used-drug-for-type-2-diabetes-also-slows-down-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; tailored to each patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "molecular fingerprints" of insulin resistance not only predict how your body reacts to insulin, but they also help doctors understand which treatments might work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The fasting phosphoproteome landscape is a critical determinant of IS (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeppe Kjærgaard Northcote, another researcher on the team, explained, "When we combine this deep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mobile-app-clinically-proven-to-treat-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical data&lt;/a&gt; with the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we suddenly understand a lot more about people’s insulin resistance that we can use to design precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that one protein, BDH1, had a strong positive link to insulin sensitivity. Another protein, HSPA2, showed the opposite. These patterns remained steady across both men and women, even though male and female &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; can differ in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="taking_a_closer_look_at_the_science"&gt;Taking a Closer Look at the Science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perform this study, researchers developed a high-throughput method to prepare tissue samples. Using advanced technology, they ran nearly 500 tests to examine protein levels in muscle. They found more than 29,000 phosphorylation sites across 3,000 proteins—an impressive level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that insulin resistance is not just about how much insulin you produce or how much glucose you absorb. It’s about the specific proteins in your muscle cells and how they behave. These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-natural-antibiotics-hidden-within-human-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; are shaped by both your genetics and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Preserved and dysregulated insulin signaling across states of insulin resistance (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that these protein patterns were better at predicting insulin sensitivity than traditional blood tests like fasting glucose or HbA1c. Even in a fasting state, the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-identifies-the-mechanisms-behind-learning-memory-and-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteomic data&lt;/a&gt; strongly reflected how a person would respond to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the standard clinical tests might miss early signs of insulin resistance. In contrast, muscle proteins could reveal what’s going on under the surface much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another powerful part of this study was the use of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/machine-learning-can-identify-mild-cognitive-impairment-from-retinal-scans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;. By feeding the protein data into a Random Forest model, the team could accurately predict insulin resistance. The model was even more precise than simply grouping people by whether or not they had diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal component analysis further showed that insulin resistance follows a spectrum. People don't fall into just two categories. Instead, they scatter along a wide range of sensitivity, and this variation shows up clearly in the molecular data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The sex-specific molecular signature reveals shared and distinct features of metabolism (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_road_ahead"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists hope this research will inspire a shift in how doctors approach type 2 diabetes. Instead of waiting for blood sugar levels to rise or symptoms to appear, doctors might one day use molecular signatures to detect insulin resistance early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could lead to better treatment strategies. People could receive therapies based on their own &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-the-largest-protein-ever-found-in-biology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research is still in its early stages, it already shows great promise. By using detailed protein data, we can better understand how the body responds to insulin.

None of them, she felt, truly listened or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13620287/doctors-gaslighting-dismissing-womens-pain.html"&gt;took her symptoms seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2015, after a year of asking doctors to order her an MRI, one of them finally listened, and what appeared on the scan changed the course of her life entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14738375/Doctors-dismissed-dizzy-spells-swimmers-ear-cancer.html"&gt;she had a tumor&lt;/a&gt; called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain so forcefully that both hemispheres were being pushed to the right side of her skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not classified as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9f2d4790-68a6-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, meningiomas can be deadly if complications arise, boasting a mortality rate of anywhere from 63 to 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent multiple surgeries to seal off the blood vessel feeding the tumor in the hopes of preventing it from growing larger, followed by a procedure to remove the mass in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and the conversations, and I was at the point where I was begging people to believe me,’ Ruhoy told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The sad part is that if someone had believed me earlier on, I think I could have prevented a lot of the recurrences that I had to go through because I've now undergone three rounds of radiation to my brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ilene Ruhoy specializes in complex post-exposure illnesses such as long Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy was healthy before her medical crisis, like many of her current patients. She questioned how this could have happened, feeling she had done everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her quest for answers, Ruhoy complained of light sensitivity and severe, long-lasting migraines that doctors told her were due to her stressful job as a neurologist in a hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said one doctor stayed glued to their computer and failed to even make eye contact with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another told her, after she begged for an MRI because she knew something was  wrong, that he 'didn't want to feed into the hysteria by ordering an MRI.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said 'Looking back, I think that I just wasn't cognizant of what was really happening when it was happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and basically I was at the point where I was like begging people to believe me, because things just were getting worse for me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around nine months into her illness, before being diagnosed, she found a primary care doctor and as&lt;span&gt; soon as Ruhoy walked into her new doctor's office, she began to sob, telling the physician that she had reached her wit's end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many of Ruhoy's patients are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I said was, please, just order me an MRI. And she said the famous words, "when a neurologist asks you to order a brain MRI, you order a brain MRI,"' Ruhoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember that moment when she just agreed and I almost hugged her. I didn't, I should have, but I was just so grateful, and I will always be grateful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ruhoy spoke to DailyMail.com about her new book published by St Martin's Publishing Group about treating complex chronic illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy still does not know definitively what caused her own tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I have a PhD in environmental toxicology, so I've thought long and hard about this; what exposures have I had in my life, what infections have I had in my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was diagnosed, I underwent a big workup, led by myself, to try to answer that exact question, and I really came up with nothing. We don't really know what causes these tumors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inspired by her own journey, Ruhoy would come to specialize in complex post-exposure illnesses (PEIs), such as long Covid and chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with poorly understood chronic illnesses fed by exposure to certain medications, pathogens, or trauma generally describe feeling 'gaslit' by their doctors who don't adequately listen to their concerns, often brush them off as being due to stress, give up trying to treat patients, and alienate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She vowed to help patients who have felt let down by the medical establishment and to not allow them to leave her office without setting forth on the path to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PEIs encompass several diagnoses marked by a wide array of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Ruhoy, exposure can be to anything external and does not always involve an infection. For instance, she said, long-term exposure to pesticides or mold have been linked to cases of Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that she had a tumor called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her newfound career treating PEIs began with Danielle, a dancer in her early 30s who developed debilitating joint pain, food allergies, hives, swelling in her hands and feet, dizziness, headaches, and neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of her patients today are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional in their quest to figure out what is driving their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle was no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She asked Danielle a laundry list of questions, questions no doctor had asked her before: Did she ever have any pain disorders? Did family members have similar symptoms to hers? Did she choke a lot? Did she have chest pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A detailed blood test revealed Danielle's hypothyroidism, missed by other doctors who hadn't ordered a comprehensive panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This likely caused her fatigue, menstrual issues, hair loss, bloating, and skin changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ruhoy addressed each symptom: an MRI uncovered a misdiagnosed spinal problem, treated with muscle relaxants; medication stabilized her dizziness; and specialists managed her heart and joint pain. Within months, Danielle felt significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to treating patients’ symptoms with medication, Ruhoy recommends drug-free treatments: being active, even for a short walk, time in nature, and following a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Will you ever be “normal” again? It’s a question I hear often from patients, and unfortunately— if by “normal” you mean a full return to the person you were before this chronic illness... I can’t promise that you will,’ Ruhoy wrote in her book Invisible No More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, if you care for yourself, if you remain diligent in the ways we have discussed, and if you attend to your body and listen to the signals it sends you… then you have a great chance of being well. Very well, even.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If so, it might be time to switch up your routine. That's because &lt;strong&gt;certain vitamins, especially if you’re deficient in them, may not absorb as well if they interact with some of the components in coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/18/3155" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that coffee intake can increase vitamin D levels, while decreasing levels of zinc, calcium and vitamin B. And although coffee contains valuable polyphenol antioxidants like chlorogenic acid (CGA) that can help reduce your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12168468/#s5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, these same compounds could negatively affect absorption of certain vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Experts suggest&lt;strong&gt; capping your daily caffeine intake at 200 mg (about 2 cups of brewed coffee) to reap the most health benefits. &lt;/strong&gt;And regardless of daily caffeine intake, avoid taking &lt;strong&gt;the vitamins and minerals below within an hour of drinking coffee. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins and minerals you shouldn't take with coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee at the same time that you take your iron supplement can greatly reduce iron absorption. In fact, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajh.26987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2022 study from Switzerland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2022 study from Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; showed that when iron deficient women took an iron supplement with coffee, iron absorption was decreased by 54% compared to taking it with water. The disruption of iron absorption stems from its interaction with the polyphenol and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11858154/#sec4-molecules-30-00800" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tannin antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tannin antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; in coffee. The good news is that &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2020 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2020 study shows&lt;/a&gt; there was no decrease in iron absorption when coffee was consumed one or two hours &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/92/2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study shows&lt;/a&gt; that higher intakes of caffeine were linked with lower levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] — what's more commonly referred to as &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/vitamin-d-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested that caffeine, like that found in coffee, may interfere with vitamin D absorption by reducing the expression of vitamin D receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B Vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in coffee has a diuretic effect that can lead to increased excretion of water-soluble vitamins, including most B vitamins as well as vitamin C, before they are fully absorbed. On top of that, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160559/#:~:text=Some%20harmful%20effects%20have%20been,on%20the%20case%20(14)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols in coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols in coffee&lt;/a&gt; may also impact B vitamin absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin D is important in the absorption and use of calcium in building bone, drinking coffee may indirectly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7397437/#:~:text=As%20vitamin%20D%20is%20important,optimum%20pharmacological%20effect%20%5B14%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce calcium absorption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt; a bit when consuming at the same time as your supplement. This is especially true for those who may already have low calcium or vitamin D levels, or those who are at risk for osteoporosis, such as the older adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to consume coffee and vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking any vitamin or supplement on the list above, be sure to separate coffee consumption from your daily dosage of vitamins by at least an hour. But you may want to keep your morning coffee intact and instead change your supplement timing to later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If possible, it’s best to eat breakfast first, or drink coffee with breakfast, so you’re not consuming coffee on an empty stomach which can irritate your stomach lining,&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/shelley-balls" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutritionist for &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WOWMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WOWMD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Then, wait an hour or two to take your supplements.&lt;/strong&gt; “Limiting your intake of coffee to two cups per day can also help reduce nutrient absorption interference,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to get a vitamin organizer and place the supplements that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; interact with coffee in the daytime compartments and those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in the evening ones, when you are less likely to consume coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about tea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like coffee, many types of tea also contain antioxidants and similar compounds found in coffee that may interfere with the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. “Tea, especially black and green varieties, also contain tannins and caffeine, both of which can affect nutrient absorption," says &lt;a href="http://www.eatwelltobewellrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, an Outpatient Clinical Dietitian at Cotton O'Neil Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. &lt;strong&gt;"While the impact may be slightly less than coffee depending on the type and amount, it’s still smart to avoid pairing tea with supplements like iron or calcium.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ways to help absorb vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides rescheduling your coffee consumption, there are other things you can do to optimize your vitamin and mineral absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more nutrient-dense meals and snacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your vitamin and mineral intake is enough by increasing your intake of nutrients like calcium and iron through meals and snacks. Calcium is found in milk and milk-based items like yogurt, and cheese as well as fortified plant-based milk and juice, while good sources of iron include meat, poultry, fish, seafood as well as plant-based foods like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds. Consuming vitamin C with your iron-rich meals may help boost its absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Since non-decaf coffee contains caffeine, which is a diuretic, it could contribute to fluid and mineral losses, especially to water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin C. So, make sure you consume plenty of water and other low-calorie, decaffeinated drinks with each meal and snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit your healthcare provider:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re worried your vitamin and mineral levels may be low, be sure to have your levels tested at least once a year. If you’re deficient in any vitamins and minerals, you can get a prescription for the necessary nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the most of your vitamin routine without skipping your morning coffee, it’s all about the timing. &lt;strong&gt;Check your supplement labels for those nutrients where coffee components are most likely to interfere, and take these vitamins at least one hour from the time of your cup of Joe.&lt;/strong&gt; And if you’re still worried you’re not absorbing enough nutrients, simply add more nutrient-dense foods at meals and snacks and visit your doctor each year to test for your vitamin and mineral levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:58:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBlWTVfQ3dmOS1qWmJjNVZUdnFtcXB5UGQybUU0Q1FiLXV2NGNfSTVVa0xocG1WaGZIT3RVd1pNbHpHd3VieTZvWDJ5LWRhWjRJUHh0akFkOGNiSVJCU1puQVZjcmpOUEhHUm1hUVFxNEtXNFNFZmFhRw</guid></item><item><title>Benadryl对过敏缓解安全吗？了解它可能影响您大脑的令人震惊的方式|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/is-benadryl-safe-for-allergy-relief-know-the-shocking-ways-it-may-affect-brain-101753617874256.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benadryl is often resorted to for bringing relief to allergy symptoms.

There are several concerns about negative side effects and even long-term &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/covid-19-infection-may-accelerate-brain-ageing-long-term-neurodegenerative-diseases-in-elderly-study-101659424611619.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="neurodegenerative disease"&gt;neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why was Benadryl popular in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason it was popular before was because of its immediate effect on the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-you-take-allergy-pills-before-hitting-the-gym-to-avoid-seasonal-sniffles-study-warns-you-may-want-to-think-twice-101750394338531.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="allergy"&gt;allergy&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Anna Wolfson, an allergist at Massachusetts General Hospital, spoke to the NYT and elaborated in the report, “This drug, whose generic name is diphenhydramine, provides almost immediate allergy relief. And with Benadryl around since the 1940s, it’s become the ‘Kleenex’ of antihistamines."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benadryl has been around since the 1940s, as Dr Wolfson pointed out, indicating that it has been around so long, across generations even, that its presence became familiar. It’s what parents or grandparents may have used, which is why it continued to be trusted since the 20th century, till the time doubts were raised by the medical community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Wolfson used the reference of Kleenex, which is a brand of tissue in the United States, but became synonymous with the product itself. In a similar analogy, Benadryl became synonymous with antihistamines, medications that stop allergy symptoms. So often, people think that is the only go-to for allergy control, not knowing there are other safer options available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, as per Dr Wolfson, according to the report, Benadryl should only be used if it's the only option available. She used another interesting analogy of if someone is stranded on a deserted island and that's the only option available, then only should one use it, otherwise no. In most other situations, she said, there are safer and better alternatives to choose from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the side effects?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/27/original/grogy_1_1753622554729.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)" title="Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The side effects are alarming, acting as a wake-up call for the medical community to question Benadryl's safety. The majority of side effects are neurological, associated with the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/acupuncturist-shares-3-dementia-preventing-hand-exercises-you-should-do-every-day-take-your-brain-to-the-gym-101753605044386.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="brain"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report stated that Benadryl belongs to an older class of antihistamines. It can enter the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier and often leaving people feeling drowsy or mentally foggy. This leads to groginess and heightens the risk of falling, car accidents and even potential dementia. Explaining what goes on in the body during an allergy, the report described that bodies release a chemical called histamine to help fight the germs. But sometimes, harmless things like peanuts, dust or pollens also trigger the same response, like making you sneeze or cough. Here's where Antihistamines help in blocking this overreaction and relieving the symptoms of allergy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another expert, Dr Zachary Rubin, an Illinois-based allergist, weighed in on this subject of safety in the report, and noted, “Benadryl, ZzzQuil and other drugs with diphenhydramine can also make you drowsy, since histamine helps the brain stay alert.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rubin further continued that the feeling is almost like being ‘knocked out,' impairing overall brain function temporarily. He said, “The feeling is more like being knocked out after having too much to drink, than deep, restorative sleep.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another expert, Dr David Stukus, seconded this in the report and added, “You have this lingering hangover effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The side effect is so dangerous that the European Union added it to the ‘do not drive’ list, and even pilots are not allowed to fly Benadryl even if they have taken it two to three days ago, showcasing how lasting and dangerous the side effects can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How is Benadryl associated with dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/17/original/shutterstock_2489919231_1734432409977.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)" title="There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per a 2015 &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091745" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine, long-term use of an acetylcholine-blocking drug is linked to a higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s, 54 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively. But according to the report, experts say this doesn’t directly prove that Benadryl causes dementia, although it does interfere with acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for memory, focus, and learning. However, this study highlights the lasting consequence of Benadryl consumption on brain health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Better to opt for safer options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wolfson clarified, “Occasional use is fine.” But when buying any antihistamines for allergies, she recommended opting for newer ones like cetirizine and fexofenadine, commonly known as Zyrtec and Allegra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the report, another expert, Dr. Sarah Taylor-Black, an allergist at Dartmouth Health, added that these newer antihistamines don’t cross into the brain as much, making them a safer choice with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The new platform, BioMapAI, achieved 90% accuracy in identifying ME/CFS patients based on stool, blood, and symptom data—offering long-overdue validation for millions living with this debilitating illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that patients had distinct biological signatures, including lower levels of beneficial fatty acids, disrupted immune cell activity, and metabolic imbalances.

Details appear today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often compare ME/CFS to long COVID, as both conditions frequently follow viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals— many undiagnosed—and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and immune responses interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers  mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS,” Oh said. “Linking symptoms at this level is crucial, because ME/CFS is highly variable. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can’t fully capture that complexity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed comprehensive data collected from the Bateman Horne Center, a leading ME/CFS, Long-Covid, and fibromyalgia research center in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ruoyun Xiong, also a lead author on the study, developed a deep neural network model called BioMapAI. The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances. The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also revealed that patients who were ill for less than four years had fewer disrupted networks than those who were ill for more than  ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time,” Unutmaz said. “That doesn’t mean longer-duration ME/CFS can’t be reversed, but it may be more challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance,” said Unutmaz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Actionable Dataset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists’ understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since animal models can’t fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The microbiome and metabolome are dynamic,” Oh said. “That means we may be able to intervene—through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies—in ways that genomic data alone can’t offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BioMapAI also achieved roughly 80% accuracy in external data sets, confirming key biomarkers identified in the original group. This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites,” Oh said. “That tells us this is not random. This is real biological dysregulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce,” Oh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By connecting these dots we can start to understand what’s driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Elizabeth Aiken, Ryan Caldwell, Lina Kozhaya, and Courtney Gunter (The Jackson Laboratory), and Suzanne D.

      &lt;p&gt;Obstetricians and psychiatrists are concerned about a recent FDA panel spreading misinformation about the potential harms of using SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should pregnant women and new mothers take antidepressants? A recent Food and Drug Administration panel raised questions about the safety of these drugs. An estimated 6% to 8% of pregnant women take antidepressants known as SSRIs. Doctors and psychiatrists treating these patients say the FDA panel misrepresented evidence and spread misinformation. NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee is here to tell us more. Rhitu, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHITU CHATTERJEE, BYLINE: Happy to be here, Ayesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: So I understand you watched the FDA panel. What exactly did the panelists say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, opened the event, framing the whole discussion around these so-called potential harms of a group of anxiety and depression drugs called SSRIs, which are medicines like Zoloft and Lexapro. And then a majority of panelists, including some psychiatrists, psychologists, a social work professor, cited studies they say illustrate health risks to both mom and baby. One panelist - Roger McFillin, a psychologist from Pennsylvania - suggested that women feel coerced into taking these medicines and that depression is overdiagnosed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROGER MCFILLIN: Is that because this underlying mental illness that we're trying to control for - one we don't test for when there is no objective testing - it just is more prevalent in women? Or are women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely? And those are gifts. They're not symptoms of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: Now, to be clear, psychiatrists use a specific set of criteria to diagnose depression and anxiety. And a person has to have had five or more of those criteria for a depression diagnosis, and just feeling overly emotional isn't enough to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: What are doctors and psychiatrists saying about the panel's claims of harms caused by SSRI use in pregnancy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So several health care groups and organizations have released statements against those claims and said that they are misleading. Now, responding to that critique, Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the federal Health Department, told NPR in an email that the claim that the panel was, quote, "one-sided" is, quote, "insulting" to the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I spoke with Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - or ACOG - one of the groups pushing back on some of the panel's claims. He explained why the studies cited by most panelists were what he described as poor-quality evidence or nonevidence-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTOPHER ZAHN: So if you're comparing a pregnant patient who has taken an SSRI, the control group should be the pregnant patient with mental health abnormalities who hasn't taken an SSRI. And part of the problem with a number of those studies - they don't use the right control group. And in fact, it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: You know, Dr. Zahn told me that well-controlled studies don't find this association of SSRI use with those health risks that the panelists talked about. Now, the one risk that does show up is for newborns of moms who take the drugs in the third trimester. And the babies can have some withdrawal symptoms, but they resolve on their own in a few days. And according to him and most others in the field, the bottom line is these studies that have followed hundreds of thousands of women find that most SSRIs are safe for pregnant and postpartum women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: What about the people who are just trying to decide whether they should take these drugs when they're pregnant or just after giving birth? What are the main things they need to know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So firstly, Ayesha, is that there are risks of not treating their symptoms at this stage of life. The negative consequences on the health of both mom and baby are very well-documented. Here's Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross. She's an OBGYN at the University of Florida, and she was the only person on the FDA panel to spell those harms out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAY ROUSSOS-ROSS: When mental health conditions go untreated, these women are less likely to attend their prenatal care appointments, and they're more likely to use substances during their pregnancy. They are also more likely to face additional risks such as preeclampsia and cesarean delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: And mental illness is a leading cause of maternal deaths in this country, including deaths due to suicide. Now, I should add that SSRIs aren't the only option for treating anxiety and depression during and after pregnancy. For those with mild to moderate depression and anxiety, you know, talk therapy is the first and best option. There's also peer support. But for those with moderate to severe depression and those who are having trouble accessing talk therapy, which is a big issue, then antidepressants are an option. Now, it won't be right for everyone, but talk about all of this with your doctor. Weigh it all against the risk of not treating your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: That's NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee. Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But I don't love limping around after them.

There are medical-billing codes intended to capture all manner of injuries — even including being &lt;a href="https://www.aapc.com/codes/icd-10-codes/W59.22XA" target="_blank"&gt;struck by a turtle&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/V00-Y99/V95-V97/V95-/V95.43XA" target="_blank"&gt;spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; — which allow health insurers and researchers to tally cases. But there’s nothing that measures if you’ve been “struck by a toddler” or otherwise injured from child care, and several health-data experts told me they didn’t know how to begin capturing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FZ2SJAMQIZFBRGSNUQ3RAX5O4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s one of those patient populations that’s overlooked because everybody has kids,” &lt;a href="https://www.pivotphysicaltherapy.com/about/clinical-staff/jordan-m/" target="_blank"&gt;Jordan Miller&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist at Athletico, a nationwide chain of rehab centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XEQ4WMU3PNEYLBXUKX5M6ABPSY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XEQ4WMU3PNEYLBXUKX5M6ABPSY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Caregiving contortions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SEAEG4KIJBYVDQ4D4ARYYLERQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In theory, parenting &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; make for a well-designed workout because a child’s weight and activity levels steadily increase. A six-pound newborn becomes a 12-pound baby and later a 24-pound toddler. Pushing an infant in a stroller gives way to chasing that child at a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XUPJGHEGD5FARMN2JNTKZTQZYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In reality, as children treat their parents’ bodies like jungle gyms — yanking on arms, jumping on backs — injuries quickly follow, often concentrated in a few places. Friends have told me about developing tennis or golf elbow, not because they played the sports, but because of carrying their children or scrubbing bottles and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;breast-pump parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5754M2ZYBARZHMEXVJEIVN7HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“In my practice, back, neck, shoulder, wrist are the most common” injuries among parents of young children, said &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/orthopedics/sports-medicine/team/physical-therapists/cody-mansfield" target="_blank"&gt;Cody Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist at Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AW2WQLBMGVEARBCO446TQ6HPPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of these strains may be exacerbated by societal pressures and demographic changes.

Miller, who leads Athletico’s program to help new parents recover their physical health, pointed to diastasis recti, a frequent condition when a pregnant person’s abdominal muscles separate.

Better to make two trips now than one trip now and a trip to the doctor’s office later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M7TTDMWN5NCM3JKV6LUNZNU5HM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear a path. &lt;/b&gt;This was a hard-won lesson after I broke my toe in the middle of the night. Every evening, we now spend a few minutes picking up toys and clearing the floor.

			&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-rewrites-rules-of-healthy-foods-for-first-time-in-30-years"&gt;guidance on eating eggs&lt;/a&gt; has been wildly inconsistent, with some studies suggesting that the popular breakfast choice is deleterious to one's health, while other studies prop them up as an excellent source of protein and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, a new study adds its voice to the growing body of evidence that eggs are actually really good for you. It's an examination of the discrete influences of saturated fat and cholesterol on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LPL), or 'bad', cholesterol in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eggs have long been unfairly cracked by outdated dietary advice. They're unique – high in cholesterol, yes, but low in saturated fat. Yet it's their cholesterol level that has often caused people to question their place in a healthy diet," &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/media-centre/Releases/2025/sunny-side-up-for-eggs-and-cholesterol/"&gt;says exercise scientist Jonathan Buckley&lt;/a&gt; of the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this study, we separated the effects of cholesterol and saturated fat, finding that high dietary cholesterol from eggs, when eaten as part of a low saturated fat diet, does not raise bad cholesterol levels. Instead, it was the saturated fat that was the real driver of cholesterol elevation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-eggs-might-protect-brain-health-and-lower-cholesterol?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Eggs Might Protect Brain Health And Lower Cholesterol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 61 adults with the same baseline levels of LDL cholesterol, and tasked them with undertaking three different diets, for five weeks each. A total of 48 participants completed all three diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was a high-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet that included two eggs per day. The second was a low-cholesterol, high-saturated fat with no eggs. Finally, the third was high in both cholesterol and saturated fat, and included one egg per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that diets high in saturated fat correlated with a rise in LDL cholesterol levels. However, the high-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet produced a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels – suggesting that eggs are not responsible for bad cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could say we've delivered hard-boiled evidence in defense of the humble egg," &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/media-centre/Releases/2025/sunny-side-up-for-eggs-and-cholesterol/"&gt;Buckley says&lt;/a&gt;. "So, when it comes to a cooked breakfast, it's not the eggs you need to worry about – it's the extra serve of bacon or the side of sausage that's more likely to impact your heart health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.05.001"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In situations that the body perceives as fight-or-flight, it helps the body to produce immediate energy – as well as suppressing non-essential functions such as digestion or repair (we’ll get to whether this is a bad thing or not shortly). “Cortisol plays a vital role in blood-sugar regulation, by prompting the liver to produce glucose and helping ensure a steady supply of fuel to the brain and body,” says Hannah Alderson, a nutritionist, hormone specialist and author of Everything I Know About Hormones. “It also helps modulate inflammation, keeping immune responses in check and preventing them from going into overdrive. It’s key in how we metabolise fat, protein and carbohydrate.” It also regulates blood pressure, can act as a mood buffer, and kicks in to help fight infection if we’re recovering from an acute illness. But one of its most vital roles is also its least talked-about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s the hormone that gets us out of bed,” says Angela Clow, emeritus professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. “You get this burst of it in the morning, which is called the ‘cortisol awakening response’. That’s not a bad thing or a stress response – it’s the body’s way of waking up and promoting cognitive function. You’ve probably experienced a time when you have an early flight or a busy day ahead, and your body anticipates it and wakes you up without needing an alarm clock. That’s cortisol priming your brain to be more alert and more active, preparing you for the day ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0b3f1803-e6c9-467d-9c56-a47821e398cf" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Rising cortisol levels help us get ready for the day ahead.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; Flashpop/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Research published &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.1844" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that cortisol is already increasing from its lowest point about three hours before&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you wake up – putting to rest any idea that getting up &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is stressful for the body, and suggesting instead that rising cortisol levels are part of what gets us ready for the day. Like every other higher organism on the planet, we’ve evolved to live in an environment that’s dark for (roughly) half of every day, and so our body needs a way to switch from restoration into activity, which seems to be one of cortisol’s key roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A very large proportion of the genes in your body are sensitive to cortisol,” says Stafford Lightman, a professor of medicine at Bristol Medical School and co-author on the recent research. “And so cortisol has a daily rhythm, and that daily rhythm regulates multiple genes in multiple tissues; in your brain, your liver and your immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As part of this process, cortisol levels gradually decline throughout the day, with periodic bursts approximately every 90 minutes helping to maintain proper bodily function. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it does make gauging it difficult: you could take two measurements 30 minutes apart and get two wildly differing numbers. Under laboratory conditions, researchers take cortisol readings from blood or saliva multiple times a day to obtain a general picture of how volunteers’ levels fluctuate and respond to stressors. At-home tests are much less useful: if you’re only testing yourself once or twice a day, the only thing you might notice is that your levels are very high or very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="55b1dd9a-9644-41f6-ad64-98532dd9016a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Dad, you’re messing with my hormones!’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by models; Ivan Rodriguez Alba/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So what about the idea that the minor stresses of everyday life are constantly keeping our cortisol levels perilously high? One common characterisation of the way this might work is that our bodies, evolved to deal with sabre-tooth tiger attacks and flash floods, can’t easily distinguish between those sorts of immediate, physical threats and more psychological ones – an argument on the school run, say, or a nasty email from a client. Social stressors, the theory goes, can be insidious: they’re basically ever-present, especially if we’re prone to catastrophise, and if our bodies’ restorative systems switch themselves off every time we encounter them, we’ll never have time for rest and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2f16794b-d242-4a8d-b40f-3e1f914c168c" data-spacefinder-role="thumbnail" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-13rnsx0"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Baboon beta males have shorter lives than alphas.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karel Tupy/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In baboon troops – which are very social and hierarchical – this effect is visible, with the lower-pecking-order males suffering with worse immunity and shorter lifespans, as their fight-or-flight systems are constantly prioritised over the rest-and-digest ones. But baboon lives tend to be genuinely far more stressful than human ones – if you’re kicked out of the troop or can’t find a mate, you’re facing a genuine, near-immediate threat to your genes’ survival, rather than just feeling a bit put out. There’s speculation, of course, that our bodies can’t make this sort of distinction, and that we still internally respond to having our birthday forgotten at the office like we would to banishment on the savannah. But is that really true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As it turns out, probably not. To test the effect of short-term bursts of stress, psychologists have developed all sorts of unpleasant laboratory procedures – from cold-water immersion to problem-solving under time pressure, to the Trier Social Stress Test, where volunteers are tasked with delivering a speech and mental arithmetic task in front of an unresponsive panel of evaluators. And the effect isn’t as pronounced as you might have been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Trying to stress a human is really difficult,” says Lightman. “Even plunging your hand into freezing-cold water has very little effect. If you’ve got a really important job interview that is going to govern the rest of your life, then yes, that’s probably going to be stressful. But it’s very subjective – some people, of course, actually like giving presentations in front of a crowd. With things like the Trier test, you might get a reaction the first time, and then you won’t again – just understanding what the test is about is enough to destroy the effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This means you’re unlikely to be suffering spikes in cortisol from the odd snippy Zoom call or altercation at the self-checkout – and, even if your body sees those situations as a threat to your wellbeing, there are other systems that kick in first. “It’s not just cortisol that goes up in stressful situations,” says Dr Thomas Upton, a clinical research fellow who also worked on the recent study. “There are other hormones – like catecholamines, your adrenaline and noradrenaline – that play key roles in the immediate part of the fight-or-flight response. This is what helps you ‘fight the lion’ and get yourself out of the situation, followed up by cortisol release if the stress is strong enough or long enough. What you’re feeling in a very stressful situation like a jump scare is a rush of adrenaline that makes your heart pound and your mouth go dry and all the rest of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="804795f8-3898-4f8f-82a0-f8b961fad32a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Heightened cortisol becomes more of an issue when you’re continuously stressed.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Pankova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Brief, short-term stress is probably not doing you any harm, then. But does this mean heightened cortisol becomes more of an issue when you’re continuously stressed over the long term – for instance, from worrying about a family problem or the mortgage – or even deliberately putting yourself through too many difficult workouts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That’s a bit trickier,” says Prof Clow. “If you just have a short burst of perceived stress, you will have a little burst of cortisol. That’s fine: your body will speedily return to normal cortisol secretion. But if you’re chronically stressed, repeatedly getting these bursts, that can affect the regulation of your underlying circadian pattern, which is regulated by your biological clock. So that, instead of having a healthy dynamic pattern of cortisol secretion over each 24 hours, you get ‘flat-lining’, which is not able to regulate other processes adequately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Constant stress, then, is probably bad for your cognitive function and health. But cortisol is unlikely to change how you look, unless there are larger problems at play. “If you had Cushing’s syndrome, which is a rare condition where cortisol levels in the body are very high, for example due to a tumour of the adrenal gland, then yes, you might gain extra weight around the stomach, or notice that your face becomes round and puffy,” says Niamh Martin, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London. “But that tends to be with very, very high cortisol levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And, while it’s true that something like a long run can elevate cortisol levels over the short term, that doesn’t mean there’s any need to ditch your plans for a new personal best. “Doing, say, a marathon is a massively stressful situation for the body,” says Upton. “You need a cortisol response in that situation, and there’s nothing wrong with it: if you &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have that response, the results would probably be terrible. You might actually die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ca1d9d9b-0982-4676-8530-702ab2288d27" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Feeling stressed and wondering if a ‘cortisol detox’ can help?

Unless you’re suffering from a clear medical issue, you probably also don’t need to worry about how your cortisol’s changing on a daily or hourly basis. Several companies are working on methods for continuously monitoring cortisol levels as you go about your everyday life – but even these could do most people more harm than good. “Something that we’ve seen with glucose monitors is that they create a lot of ‘worried well’ people who put one on, have their breakfast and say, oh hell, my blood sugar’s gone up too much,” says Lightman. “And then they start worrying about doing all sorts of things and make themselves ill. If you’re an Olympic sprinter or something, continuous monitoring might be useful. But, among most people, there’s so much individual variation that the range we call ‘normal’ is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There’s one more obvious question here, though: if cortisol &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the culprit, why does stress seem to go hand in hand with poor health, immune-system disruption and weight gain? “It’s very difficult to unpick,” says Martin. “For instance, many of us have a complex relationship with food – and there are behavioural reasons why we eat besides being hungry – so it’s easy to blame cortisol if we notice that we’re gaining weight, but it might also be that, because we’re stressed, we’re eating in a different way. Similarly, you might be having a tough time at work and that means you don’t have time to exercise, or you’re not sleeping well because you’re stressed and that’s negatively affecting your cortisol levels, rather than the relationship going the other way. Part of the issue is that we still don’t fully understand the chronic stresses that modern life involves and what their impact is on our bodies over a long period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So what does all this mean for you and your life – stressful or otherwise? “I think the most evidence-backed approach is to treat cortisol as something like a bystander, rather than blaming it for any issues you’re having,” says Martin. “If you’re chronically stressed, that’s something to deal with for health reasons, but it’s not necessarily a question of artificially finding ways to keep your cortisol down – it’s more holistic than that. The most important thing is to look after yourself, rather than reaching for an expensive supplement or a cortisol cocktail or anything like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="03046259-1e00-455d-b7b2-a352876d0d82" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":25,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Five free, easy ways to fight chronic inflammation","elementId":"03046259-1e00-455d-b7b2-a352876d0d82","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are a few things that seem to help keep cortisol well regulated,” says Clow. “The research suggests, for instance, that the earlier you wake – within reason – promotes a healthy and dynamic cortisol rhythm. So getting plenty of sleep and then getting up relatively early seems to be very good for you. There’s increasing evidence that night-time light exposure inhibits your melatonin secretion, which liberates cortisol and allows it to rise while you sleep.” It’s worth mentioning, though, that getting enough sleep – and on a &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(23)00166-3/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;regular schedule&lt;/a&gt; – might be more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Physical exercise seems to keep cortisol well regulated but, if you can’t face the gym, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. “Gentle exercise, like walking, stretching or pilates, can regulate cortisol far better than an hour-long Hiit class on an empty stomach,” says Alderson. “Breath work is amazing and you can do it anywhere. Micromoments of joy are a lot simpler to weave in than grand gestures like week-long yoga retreats – and, even if they’re not directly affecting your cortisol, they matter more than people realise. A laugh, a hug, a walk in nature: this stuff really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Finally, it’s important to remember that, even if modern living does occasionally nudge your hormones outside optimal levels, cortisol is on your side. Your body’s stress response to most things should be good for you. Try to get some exercise every day, sleep on a regular schedule, and eat as sensibly as you can. Don’t worry about the other stuff: you really don’t need the stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxPUTFPQmFIMTdCc180WXhOblJOWVNodnprYVB5SWR3ay1STVVkSDBYYVNxMTVBUVRRbDJ5aDJ1aUJYdS1kTktXM3R5R0M1RHJ2bzFlMjhCOHFfMUNlOGNGb0o3UGc5TlZPTDlwTHBvQWJjbmxtUEtmNWpMNjlxYVRyd21rbVJ5ZDY1cjJnbGc4OC13Y0pBcEZFQUVRT3RHbGpMdEY1R0UzaXBVT2c0N281WUthdmlrdFkycTY2Q1QyWXU3dTZma1pHZVQ5dmRHeXE4TFhQcQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现有助于大脑自我清洁和抗击阿尔茨海默氏症的受体- ScienceDaily | Scientists discover the receptor that helps your brain clean itself—and fight Alzheimer’s - ScienceDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE05NzV3c0cxcGltTmRqbmJ2a3E1OEM5Q0RfV0htMHBsbFFuMHN4UWE5aXpWdmxGeE1IMlJ3c2xpOFRnY0VHcHFFc2h0R2hObV9oRUh1Ym9RVk01ckVuZkV2aFNpWU1TT3J3OW5ETFNIVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;UCSF scientists have discovered how microglia engulf and break down amyloid beta, a protein that builds up in Alzheimer's, with devastating consequences for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, proteins like amyloid beta form clumps, known as plaques, that damage the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in some people, immune cells called microglia break down these proteins before they can cause harm. This leads to fewer and smaller clumps -- and much milder symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco identified a molecular receptor that enables microglia to gobble up and digest amyloid beta plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the receptor, ADGRG1, the microglia barely nibbled on the toxic protein. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers observed how the loss of ADGRG1 led to the rapid buildup of amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and problems with learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We think this receptor helps microglia do their job of keeping the brain healthy over many years," said Xianhua Piao, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist in the UCSF Department of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when the researchers reanalyzed a prior study of gene expression in the human brain, they found that individuals who died of mild Alzheimer's had microglia with abundant ADGRG1, and mild cognitive impairment -- implying that the microglia ate well and kept the disease in check. But in those who died of severe Alzheimer's, the microglia had very little ADGRG1, and the plaques proliferated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADGRG1 is one of hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors, which are routinely targeted in drug development. This bodes well for a rapid translation of the discovery into new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some people are lucky to have responsible microglia," Piao said. "But this discovery creates an opportunity to develop drugs to make microglia effective against amyloid-beta in everyone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;strong&gt;University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Gladstone Institutes&lt;/strong&gt; have uncovered a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential new approach to treating &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using two existing &lt;strong&gt;FDA-approved cancer drugs&lt;/strong&gt;. The drugs, &lt;strong&gt;letrozole&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt;, have been found to reduce &lt;strong&gt;tau protein clumps&lt;/strong&gt; in mice, a key feature of Alzheimer’s, and improve cognitive functions like &lt;strong&gt;memory&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Repurposing Cancer Drugs for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;letrozole&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used to treat &lt;strong&gt;breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt;, prescribed for &lt;strong&gt;colon and lung cancers&lt;/strong&gt;, are already familiar in the medical world. However, their potential to address &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/the-heartbreaking-case-of-the-youngest-person-to-ever-face-alzheimers-a-condition-so-rare-even-scientists-are-speechless/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74977" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s-related brain damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was not known until recently. By targeting &lt;strong&gt;tau proteins&lt;/strong&gt;, these drugs show promise in reversing some of the damage caused by Alzheimer’s, offering a new avenue for treatment without the need for completely new drug development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key to their effectiveness seems to lie in the combination of the two drugs, each targeting different types of brain cells. &lt;strong&gt;Letrozole&lt;/strong&gt; appears to help &lt;strong&gt;neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, the cells responsible for transmitting information, while &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt; works on &lt;strong&gt;glial cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which support neurons. This dual-target approach could address Alzheimer’s from multiple angles, which is often needed for such a complex disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How the Drugs Work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the main characteristics of Alzheimer’s is the buildup of &lt;strong&gt;tau proteins&lt;/strong&gt;, which form tangles inside the brain and disrupt normal cell function. This accumulation is a significant factor in the cognitive decline that defines the disease. The combination of &lt;strong&gt;letrozole&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt; seems to reduce these tau protein clumps in the brain of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-injected-mice-with-40000-year-old-human-dna-what-emerged-has-left-everyone-speechless/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81775" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mice models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Certain Cancer Drugs May Reverse Brain Changes That Occur During Alzheimer's" class="wp-image-169045" data-lazy-src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54%E2%80%AFpm-642x494.png"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54%E2%80%AFpm-642x494.png" alt="Certain Cancer Drugs May Reverse Brain Changes That Occur During Alzheimer's" class="wp-image-169045"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The application of letrozole and irinotecan reduced the level of tau proteins (light green) in mouse brains. (Li et al., Cell, 2025)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Beyond just clearing tau clumps, the mice treated with the drugs also demonstrated improvements in &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;memory tasks&lt;/strong&gt;, which are often severely impaired in Alzheimer’s patients. This suggests that &lt;strong&gt;letrozole&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt; may not only help reduce the physical markers of the disease but could also restore some of the cognitive abilities that are lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving from Mice to Humans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the results in mice are promising, the real test lies in whether these drugs can have the same effect on humans. The drugs have already been tested and approved for other types of cancer, so they would face a quicker pathway to &lt;strong&gt;clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt; for Alzheimer’s than entirely new medications. However, before they can be used to treat Alzheimer’s, researchers must first evaluate their potential &lt;strong&gt;side effects&lt;/strong&gt; in this new context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the fact that these drugs are already FDA-approved could speed up the process. If successful, they could be repurposed for &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, which might provide a much-needed solution for the millions affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Approach to Alzheimer’s Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease currently affects over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people&lt;/strong&gt; worldwide, and that number is expected to rise as the global population ages. The current lack of effective treatments for the disease makes any potential breakthrough significant. If these drugs are shown to work in humans, it could change how Alzheimer’s is treated, offering a new therapeutic strategy for a condition that has long been difficult to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, further research and clinical trials will be essential to determine whether &lt;strong&gt;letrozole&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;irinotecan&lt;/strong&gt; can live up to their potential. However, this discovery marks an exciting step toward finding new ways to treat Alzheimer’s and highlights the possibility of repurposing existing drugs for other complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So when my urologist said in 2019 that my PSA test showed the most aggressive form of prostate cancer, I was not prepared. I was 68, and my annual tests had always been normal. Soon I embarked on a prostate cancer journey: androgen deprivation therapy, followed by external beam radiation, followed by the implantation of 97 radioactive seeds into my prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PINXCBHLXRFXRDK2V3WVXTYQUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For many people, including me, such prostate therapy can cause hot flashes, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue and decreased muscle mass. But the radiologist assured me this multilayered approach gave me the best chance of beating the cancer. What we never discussed was the “what comes after.” And in many ways, the after has been more complex and demoralizing than all my treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GURIKV5GYBEOLIEUYH4F6P62K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I expected that becoming cancer-free would mean getting my old life back. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was pudgy, weak and wobbly. I started working with a personal trainer at a gym near my home in Rockville, Maryland, using free weights and machines for two 90-minute sessions a week to get my strength back. My goal wasn’t — and isn’t — to bulk up, but simply to walk up stairs or hoist my luggage into the overhead bin on a flight without getting winded. I also practice tai chi to improve my balance, flexibility and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AJTSH4T6ZFHFFEEICYIPDCYI4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’ve made some progress — after a recent vacation to Sienna, Italy, I sent my trainer a video of me carrying two suitcases up a flight of stairs (an homage to the “suitcase squats” he has me do with two 30-pound weights). Jogging across the street to beat a don’t-walk light no longer leaves me completely breathless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JVTYRDSRGFGPNAPAO3T5PSVK5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even today I’m still sometimes tired enough to need a nap. Mowing the lawn often feels as exhausting as running a marathon. Brain fog plagues me, making it difficult to focus on simple tasks like paying bills or writing work reports. Sexual dysfunction, joint pain and emotional imbalance — all side effects that emerged posttreatment — are constant reminders that cancer care can change you in ways you never expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYBTXX6STJBNLHFEFNLNIGKNFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Emotional and mental recovery remains challenging — in some ways even more than the physical recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/treating/hormone-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Androgen deprivation therapy&lt;/a&gt; is well known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078143919300225#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20cognitive%20changes,be%20taken%20seriously%20and%20managed.///" target="_blank"&gt;to affect a patient’s emotions.&lt;/a&gt; In my case, I became what my wife called “weepy.” Even after treatment ended, I found myself on edge, constantly having to work to regulate my reactions to stress and setbacks. The stress can be something small, like a broken plate or a missed phone call — annoyances that, in the past, I wouldn’t have given a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXNJXVULEJHN5K6SRC4YOMXW2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like others who have gone through prostate cancer treatment, I am constantly evaluating what I am doing, eating and even thinking to get better and stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3UU4FBN7XJHVDDJMOHMCLLSFFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I turn 74 in November, and, no matter how optimistic the treatment outlook, dealing with cancer inevitably raises the prospect of death. I get PSA tests every six months to track my progress and prostate health. And while my PSA score remains near zero (indicating no recurrence), after every encouraging test result, the anxiety starts building again until the next evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W37OVTJ7XJBE7ENU2TJSXRUD7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The constant threat of recurrence feels like the proverbial sword of Damocles — always present, always waiting. If my cancer does return, the now-inert metal seeds scattered through my prostate and the scar tissue caused by the radiation greatly complicate my future treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L3TMWSIV6NF2LLPPUTZDF3LOF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So for me at least, cancer has become a lifelong companion. Instead of the resolution I expected, I’ve joined an ever-growing group of fellow travelers — treated for prostate, breast, lung, colon and other cancers — on the ongoing road of recovery.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I now know there may be bumps in the road that will require adaptation, work and a good dose of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 12:06:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQTFJ5Z09zLVMzZ2l0YVlOdXM0Vjh3cDRKWTFVWlVpNGNQNFpXaU14VVpxTXVFYkRzVGVicnctNmN1WXI3dnJCaVFrTlVHWFc4VkV4Z052Q0twTW80YkVETURqSHp3aXFQTFlHNGFGaUU1LUJEZ0xxUmRnWUEtSWQxTEFFanRyTjFUcUpTTl9oYkpzb3hMeXRXY3B6cw</guid></item><item><title>研究推翻了几十年来的教条：科学家发现基因调控中的“隐藏组织” - SciTechDaily | Study Overturns Decades-Old Dogma: Scientists Discover “Hidden Organization” in Gene Regulation - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVXc3bVkxR0RENFl5V2JMU29lWW5ua2tzWk9Jb0l2VkNPaDEzbHplVnRud2J6Y2tHZWV5OVlOS2c1ZFZCeG1MOFJhYnRnVnpXQXE5eE01UmdGNDNEamk5bmktdy1RNkJFVVlHY2h6cHhlRWZqZmI4WGpUWHBzQ1oyMGhPLURIcDIxb2FOVjdRWTFJT0xWa1BFcmhwQzlaU1IwRk02LW9sbndfS3VMbmMzcUxUN1IwTXVGc3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 11:37:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVXc3bVkxR0RENFl5V2JMU29lWW5ua2tzWk9Jb0l2VkNPaDEzbHplVnRud2J6Y2tHZWV5OVlOS2c1ZFZCeG1MOFJhYnRnVnpXQXE5eE01UmdGNDNEamk5bmktdy1RNkJFVVlHY2h6cHhlRWZqZmI4WGpUWHBzQ1oyMGhPLURIcDIxb2FOVjdRWTFJT0xWa1BFcmhwQzlaU1IwRk02LW9sbndfS3VMbmMzcUxUN1IwTXVGc3c</guid></item><item><title>这个简单的技巧可以帮助老年人保持健康- SciTechDaily | This Simple Trick Could Help Older Adults Stay Fit - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbTZ0RnlzTF92SmpuZHAwMXdKN3pJU2R2TV8xSGNpTUwxYUFMMGVwYWZkTmRTUkZuZG5DSkE1aUJXb0lRSjRJY0JqdmpHb19uTElhV2pfaEVXZzhldTFCOGE1X0tkVTFkVkkzWHk4T2VwNXc2SExaa1FSUmtzN3g3VDRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 11:12:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbTZ0RnlzTF92SmpuZHAwMXdKN3pJU2R2TV8xSGNpTUwxYUFMMGVwYWZkTmRTUkZuZG5DSkE1aUJXb0lRSjRJY0JqdmpHb19uTElhV2pfaEVXZzhldTFCOGE1X0tkVTFkVkkzWHk4T2VwNXc2SExaa1FSUmtzN3g3VDRB</guid></item><item><title>她正试图在产科沙漠附近开设一个分娩中心。这并不容易- NPR | She's trying to open a birth center near a maternity desert.

                Katie Chubb, a community organizer, stands in an empty lot in Augusta, Ga., where she's  been trying to open a birth center for six years.  She says lack of cooperation from local hospitals has been a primary obstacle.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Standing in front of an empty lot one afternoon in the Georgia heat, Katie Chubb gestures to the place where she's been trying to open a birth center for six years. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "We'd have parking along the road," she says, describing her vision for a place that would offer a more home-like alternative to a hospital birth.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chubb is a community organizer in a state with some of &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/state-indicator/maternal-deaths-and-mortality-rates-per-100000-live-births/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank"&gt;the highest rates of maternal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/health-news/infant-mortality-rate-up-in-georgia-as-health-officials-try-new-approaches/ZG75QNXLDJARNLTP6TY7FTBMHU/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20American%20babies,for%20every%201%2C000%20live%20births." target="_blank"&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; in the country. She says a birth center is badly needed here — Augusta, Ga., is surrounded by&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/12/1128335563/maternity-care-deserts-march-of-dimes-report" target="_blank"&gt; maternal health care deserts, &lt;/a&gt;where pregnancy care can be difficult to find and few alternatives exist outside of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Her vision is for a freestanding clinic that employs mostly midwives and works in partnership with obstetricians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But despite widespread community support and even offers of investment, Chubb has encountered obstacle after obstacle to her mission to offer more safe birth options for women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth in the U.S. can be dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has called for Americans &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/1248444378/trump-wants-americans-to-have-more-babies" target="_blank"&gt;to have more children&lt;/a&gt;. But advocates have been warning for years that maternal and infant &lt;a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/state-of-maternal-health-2025/#:~:text=What%20You%20Should%20Know,2" target="_blank"&gt;mortality rates are high &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., showing how dangerous giving birth can be. Distrust of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821693" target="_blank"&gt;medical institutions and hospitals&lt;/a&gt; is also growing across the country. And some people want more options.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Clarissa Viens was pregnant, she did not want to have her baby in a hospital. She worried that doctors would pressure her into a cesarean section or drugs to speed labor. Viens had previous births both at home and in a birth center in Alaska, where she used to live. " You are better off at a birth center," says Viens. "The baby's better because they're more relaxed at birth. They get skin to skin contact right away. They don't get bright lights," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With no similar center available in Augusta, Viens decided to give birth at home. When things started to go badly, she did go to the hospital, but it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her baby was born in the car.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During his birth, she says, he experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542241/" target="_blank"&gt;cord prolapse&lt;/a&gt; — that causes the baby's brain to be deprived of oxygen — and her son suffered a brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He came home from the hospital with a ventilator and a feeding tube. Doctors are still assessing his diagnosis at 18 months, says Viens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, she says, she would have made different decisions. "But there is only one way to go and that is forward from here." She and her husband are planning to have more children, and Viens says she still doesn't want to go to the hospital for the next one. She would happily go to a birth center, and wishes she could've gone to one for her son's birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we had had a birth center, it would've changed his outcome," says Viens.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth centers still uncommon in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are about 400 birth centers across the U.S. in more than 40 states, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.birthcenters.org/birth-centers-are-growing" target="_blank"&gt;American Association of Birth Centers&lt;/a&gt;. While still relatively rare, demand has been growing across the country in recent years for these centers, which can provide a safe alternative to hospitals, for low-risk pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Katie Chubb wanted to find a birth center when she was pregnant, but there wasn't one nearby. So, she drove more than two hours to have her son. Realizing the need, she formed her own organization, obtained an ambulance transfer agreement, recruited a doctor to partner with her, and even went so far as to successfully &lt;a href="https://reason.com/2024/04/23/new-georgia-law-stops-hospitals-from-blocking-competition-from-birthing-centers/" target="_blank"&gt;advocate for a change in Georgia law&lt;/a&gt;, allowing birth centers to open without the permission of local hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, birth centers require partnerships with hospitals and obstetricians in order to transfer patients when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hospitals won't cooperate . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chubb says hospitals don't want to give up potential revenue by surrendering patients to a birth center. "They are putting their profits over patient needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;None of the three hospitals in Augusta responded to interview requests, though one hospital — part of the larger&lt;a href="https://www.wellstar.org/locations/augusta" target="_blank"&gt; Wellstar Health System &lt;/a&gt;— issued a statement via email that said they offer their own "complete women's health services."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Augusta is not the &lt;a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2023/08/31/hospitals-block-much-needed-birth-centers-in-the-south/#:~:text=A%20%27de%20facto%20ban%27,refusing%20to%20sign%20transfer%20agreements." target="_blank"&gt;only community&lt;/a&gt; to battle with local hospitals. Similar struggles to open birth centers have played out in states including Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky and Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another reason for resistance is concern over malpractice. Obstetricians are &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/ama-assn.org/files/corp/media-browser/public/government/advocacy/policy-research-perspective-medical-liability-claim-frequency.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be sued than other kinds of specialists, says &lt;a href="https://andreabraden.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Andrea Braden&lt;/a&gt;, an obstetrician who works in Atlanta with both midwives and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is really unfortunate, but that is where a lot of the resistance comes from," she says. Braden is not involved with the effort to open a birth center in Augusta.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says obstetricians often don't want to partner with midwives for fear of being handed patients that are already in crisis and could result in a malpractice suit. "The obstetricians who have really high malpractice rates end up being stuck with the liability," she says. The American Medical Association says OB-GYNs &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/ama-assn.org/files/corp/media-browser/public/government/advocacy/policy-research-perspective-medical-liability-claim-frequency.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;average 162 liability claims &lt;/a&gt;for every 100 physicians. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;High-risk pregnancies are generally not considered good candidates for birth center deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Black women, a unique set of concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-79539" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Jonquette Sanders-White had experienced healthy pregnancies, until the birth of her fourth child. Following the birth she suffered a postpartum hemorrhage, one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.

   &lt;p&gt;Giving birth is even more &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186019422/the-black-maternal-mortality-crisis-and-why-it-remains-an-issue" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous for Black women&lt;/a&gt;, who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/womens-health/features/maternal-mortality.html#:~:text=Racial%20Disparities%20Exist,%2C%20physical%2C%20and%20emotional%20health." target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disparity has &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them/#:~:text=Large%20racial%20disparities%20in%20maternal,maternal%20and%20infant%20health%20disparities." target="_blank"&gt;grown worse&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jonquette.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonquette Sanders-White&lt;/a&gt; went to the hospital two years ago in labor with her fourth baby. The baby was fine, but Sanders-White had both a cesarean section and a hysterectomy. Hours after the surgery, she recalls, her belly was "getting more distended by the second."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was hemorrhaging. The doctors and nurses had missed it. Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading causes&lt;/a&gt; of maternal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;" All I remember," she recalls, "is that nurses and doctors rush into my room and they're screaming and shouting and they say, 'She's crashing. She's crashing, she's dying. She's dying!'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her husband, Treston White, recalls one nurse coming in to tell him "it wasn't looking good," and to "be prepared to tell her goodbye."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;White says he didn't believe the nurse and chose instead to pray. He didn't think God would take his wife. "I had no room for doubt at all," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though Sander-White made it, she is now suing the hospital and practice of surgeons who operated on her. The complaint alleges she still has serious complications from the event two years later.  NPR reached out to attorneys for the doctors and the hospital and did not hear back. Medical records included in the legal complaint show she was hemorrhaging the day of the birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reflecting back on the event, Sanders-White says one of the many upsetting things on that day was that she never interacted with a staff member of color.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;" I do think if I was another race, they would've been proactive," she says. "A little more quick to react versus waiting until I'm crashing and dying."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sanders-White says her experience has shown her that hospitals are not necessarily the safest place to be. She believes a more holistically minded birth worker would have been more attentive to her needs and prevented her near-tragedy. "We absolutely need options outside of hospitals," she says. "My eyes are open now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's stories like this that motivate Katie Chubb to keep fighting for her birth center. She says she gets weekly calls from people asking when it will be open.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chubb grew up in the U.K., where births attended by midwives are more common. She moved to Augusta after she met her now-husband on a vacation to the U.S. She says she never imagined this would be her life's work, but says she thinks her outsider perspective helps. " It makes me see the amount of injustice and inequality there is in the U.S. healthcare system," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt; "Especially with lack of patient autonomy," and choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;Innovative e-tattoo&lt;/strong&gt; developed at the University of Texas at Austin monitors brain activity in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚙️ Designed to be &lt;strong&gt;noninvasive&lt;/strong&gt; and ultra-thin, the e-tattoo adheres to the forehead and uses sticker-like sensors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📉 Machine learning models help &lt;strong&gt;predict mental fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling timely interventions before performance declines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔒 Ethical considerations include data privacy, with plans for secure, &lt;strong&gt;encrypted data transmission&lt;/strong&gt; to protect users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the demanding realms of aviation, space exploration, and industrial control rooms, even the slightest lapse in concentration can lead to catastrophic consequences. To combat this, researchers have long sought a way for the body to signal the brain before reaching full fatigue. Enter the innovative e-tattoo developed by the University of Texas at Austin. This noninvasive, ultra-thin forehead tattoo wirelessly monitors brain activity, tracking cognitive load in real time and potentially predicting mental fatigue before performance breaks down. With its introduction, high-stakes professions may soon have a tool to enhance safety and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Bulky Brain Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, monitoring brain activity involved cumbersome EEG caps laden with conductive gel and tangled wires, making them impractical for everyday use or professional settings. This is where the UT Austin team’s e-tattoo offers a revolutionary alternative. The e-tattoo is paper-thin and designed to stretch like skin, adhering to the forehead with sticker-like sensors that read electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. A lightweight battery pack powers the system wirelessly, allowing for seamless integration into daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike rigid caps, the e-tattoo’s sensors are custom-fitted to each individual’s facial structure, ensuring optimal signal quality. Dr. Nanshu Lu, a researcher on the team, explained, “Our current approach is custom-designing the e-tattoo based on facial measurements followed by fabricating the e-tattoo through a time-effective cut-and-paste fabrication method we developed before.” The design can be automated using ID-style photos, simplifying the process further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="C8MRBsTzhC"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/this-thing-defies-gravity-new-four-legged-robot-climbs-walls-50-times-faster-than-anything-ever-built-before/"&gt;“This Thing Defies Gravity”: New Four-Legged Robot Climbs Walls 50 Times Faster Than Anything Ever Built Before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring e-Tattoo Effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the e-tattoo’s efficacy, researchers conducted memory tasks with participants, gradually increasing the difficulty. As expected, the e-tattoo registered changes in brainwaves: activity in theta and delta bands increased with cognitive effort, while alpha and beta waves decreased as mental fatigue set in. This ability to detect brainwave patterns in real time marks a significant advancement in wearable technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the innovation extends beyond real-time detection. By utilizing machine learning, the research team trained a model to predict mental workload based on these signals. Although the initial analysis was done offline, the next step is real-time, in-the-moment alerts. Dr. Lu emphasized, “To make this technology really valuable, we can and need to enable timely micro-interventions—such as visual or audio alerts on the phone or even electrotactile stimulations applied to the skin by the e-tattoo—before visible performance decline or burnout occurs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QkVncEi0sg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Big Implications for the e-Tattoo, Bigger Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential applications of the e-tattoo extend far beyond pilots and engineers. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into our daily work lives, the ability to monitor human mental strain alongside machine performance could redefine human-computer interaction. This synergy could lead to more efficient and harmonious work environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the notion of continuous brain monitoring raises significant ethical concerns, particularly in workplace settings. Dr. Lu acknowledged, “We have not addressed data privacy in the current work, but I agree it is important.” To address these concerns, Lu envisions secure, encrypted data transmission that only shares information with user consent. The team is actively exploring privacy-preserving machine learning methods that avoid transmitting raw neural data altogether, ensuring that the technology remains safe and ethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5me1KOxDXT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Low-Cost, High-Impact Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most promising of all is the e-tattoo’s accessibility. Traditional EEG systems can cost upward of $15,000. In contrast, the UT Austin e-tattoo system is priced around $200 for the battery and chips, with each sensor costing about $20. This significant reduction in cost makes the technology accessible to a broader audience, democratizing access to advanced brain monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From personalized health tracking to smarter human-machine teamwork, the e-tattoo hints at a future where our brains, not just our bodies, are in constant, real-time dialogue with the tools around us. As we move forward, how will society balance the benefits of such technology with the need for privacy and ethical considerations?&lt;/p&gt;

They worked with 22 children from an orphanage — some who already stuttered and some who didn’t. The researchers told some of the kids with normal speech that they spoke badly and needed to be careful, even though that wasn’t true. As a result, some of those kids became shy, nervous, and had trouble speaking, even though they hadn’t stuttered before. The experiment caused lasting emotional harm, and it was later called the “Monster Study” because of how unethical it was.

But truth be told, it’s one of the hardest-working organs we’ve got. It keeps our digestion ticking, helps us process what we eat and drink, and clears out all sorts of unwanted rubbish. In Ayurvedic medicine, though, the liver holds an even more special place. It’s tied into the Rakta vaha srotas—a kind of inner channel linked to the flow of blood and bile. And when this system gets thrown off, the effects don’t stay in one place. They affect the heart, the lungs, stomach and every organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;According to Dr Somit Kumar, M.D (Ayu), PhD, Chief Scientific Officer &amp;amp; Director of Research, AVP Research Foundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, one has to bring about micro changes in life to see improvement. He lists out food and lifestyle choices that one should make for a healthy and happy liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ayurveda, liver health and the role of doshas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tradition, liver health is connected to what’s known as Pitta dosha, a type of energy that governs heat and digestion. Tip that balance (say, by drinking too much, eating a lot of salty or sour foods), and the liver starts to feel the strain. It can lead to inflammation, damage to the cells, and early signs of ageing. Ayurveda also talks about Agni that is the digestive fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s what turns food into Rasa dhatu, the essential nourishment that feeds every part of the body. And deep within the liver, there are five subtle fires (Bhuta agnis) each doing its bit to detoxify, digest, and renew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meal timings are important and so is the meal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the liver in good nick isn’t about fads or fancy treatments. According to Ayurveda, it starts with routine eating meals at regular times, steering clear of odd food pairings (Viruddha Ahara), and including all six flavours (Shadrasa) in your diet. Hydration matters too, not just with water but also with herbal brews that help sweep toxins out of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for food itself? It’s all about ease of digestion. Think of simple grains such as rice, oats, wheat, millet, barley etc. Lentils and green gram are easier on the stomach compared to heavier beans like kidney beans, which can sit around a bit longer. Fruits such as apple, fig, papaya, and pomegranate are believed to give the liver a helping hand. But citrus and mango? Best not to overdo it. On the veg front, carrots, beets are solid choices. Cabbage and chilli, although not bad but should probably be kept in check. When it comes to dairy, ghee and buttermilk get the green signal, while curd and paneer are better taken sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of herbs and spices&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayurveda also leans heavily on herbs and spices. Turmeric is the star of the show, thanks to curcumin—it’s like a natural anti-inflammatory. Garlic, ginger, cumin, fennel, black pepper—they’re all praised for how they help digestion, reduce stress on the liver, and make other nutrients easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the big-hitter herbs. Guduchi is often used to boost immunity and clear toxins. Bhumi Amla is another one—it’s thought to help rejuvenate liver cells. Licorice isn’t just for sweets; it’s used for reducing inflammation and supporting the gut-liver connection. There’s also Andrographis, Katuki, and Swertia—lesser-known but well-regarded in Ayurvedic circles for their protective qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The complete picture&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But food and herbs are only one part of the whole picture. Daily movement whether it’s a walk, yoga, or simply stretching helps keep everything at check. Stress is hazardous and can be a lethal mess with the liver. Mindfulness, meditation, and a bit of peace and quiet go a long way. Sleep matters more than most people realise and the liver does much of its repair work when a person is properly rested and happens to experience deep sleep daily. Skimp on sleep, and you’re likely to feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;At the end of the day, Ayurveda isn’t about quick fixes. It’s about living in rhythm, eating well, moving often, managing stress, and giving your body what it needs to heal and thrive. Look after your liver, and it’ll look after you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 10:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAJBVV95cUxPcnFlbmdqaVRQMkhpbFRZUlc4ZGEwazlpcWNjcW8yNTZZand6LUVJajdQUXpnbEZlZDF1WTBaZ3ZNNlhiQmR5eGJNMzdUUTYwUHhPbmVaV0dac0F3UjlrX1FhZzZUNG82RUQtbHdWQld6LVk0QldVeFN4TWJ4N1VONTRrc1hYS0VBYVo2aDlXblhKaGx1TUNfczdBVWVZN25VMlIwa0RONWFEOXkyZEVkNzJfeXExbW9tUEFpWTBYQWdDVHVBQkZWNFZwYmFIeEc4ZW1UbHdSUU5mTVdZOUZHb3k4azh1VkxSalVhRmFIeWZ6dlBqdmpQUUUxcGZtTkRZVnRWTjJBLTlLeDFnSWY2V20wX1pPQkRFVU5mTUUzbVE</guid></item><item><title>每天步行7,000步，使用表情符号并食用bulgur —再加上5个健康小贴士，帮助您度过美好的一周-雅虎主页</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxPaDRJODRFX0JNNDVndk0yS2xtYVZkdE9SMDZBbDdNLWk3RGxaeE9iUEo1V1lKNTcybHZBNWVXREZlVzVEQU9SSXN5YUt6MG5mVW1yMGFZQmo1VHRxVC1jUTZZRzZ1ak9KMnRSN1QxUy1nR3FfU3pRN0JpVE9hLV8zUldOUW4ySFZYaDcxUGtUZlZZdFFLWjJYYTlkTG9NNVB4MTVRZ3BLX0tNdUdfWW5HdUstSDhOQThBVnQtbExaOVBKckpnRHJSSVMwVG1SZE1qcTI1WlRsa1NpWWwxa0p2NTVIeHhHTFhRSGFpNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hello, Yahoo readers!

The researchers, who looked at data from 57 studies worldwide, also found that 7,000 steps significantly reduced the risk of dementia, type 2 diabetes and depression. There’s no harm in sticking to your 10,000-steps target (we love an overachiever), but the incentive to do more than 7,000 is pretty minimal, according to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:😊;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;😊&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Use emoji&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fire away those hearts and raised hands.

Also, using them makes it easier to clean along the gumline, which helps prevent gingivitis.

And while influencers may love lots of scrubs and lotions, dermatologist Dr. Angela Lamb warns against overdoing it on products. “Each new product you introduce provides another opportunity for something to go on your skin and potentially create an allergic or irritating reaction for you,” she says. What’s more, stripping too much of your skin’s good, protective bacteria can actually lead to more acne, not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/watch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:⌚;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;⌚&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take off your Apple Watch at night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do you track your sleep with a wearable like an Oura ring or an Apple Watch? &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/sleep/articles/orthosomnia-obsession-wearable-tech-could-151000404.html" data-ylk="slk:Good Morning America;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt; reports that wearing these devices could lead to “orthosomnia,” an obsession with getting quality rest. Sleep scientist Rebecca Robbins says some individuals become so obsessed with tracking their sleep that the “information they receive stresses them out, and then it causes them to struggle the next night.” But sleep simply can’t be perfect every night, she says, as it is “a function of all of the things that we experience in a typical day — and some of that might be stressful.” Instead of focusing too hard on what your wearable says, look at things you can control, like what time you go to bed. Another tip: Create a relaxing wind-down routine before bed with activities like journaling or taking a warm bath, which should help you ease into sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/violin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🎻;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🎻&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Play music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Musical training could help you stay sharp, new research published in &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:23;pos:1" class="link " href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3003247" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PLOS Biology;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:23;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt; finds.

    &lt;p&gt;Millions of people who recover from infections like COVID-19, influenza and glandular fever are affected by long-lasting symptoms. These include chronic fatigue, brain fog, exercise intolerance, dizziness, muscle or joint pain and gut problems. And many of these symptoms worsen after exercise, a phenomenon known as post-exertional malaise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medically the symptoms are known as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The World Health Organization classifies this as a post viral fatigue syndrome, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html"&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; by both the WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a brain disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiencing illness long after contracting an infection is not new, as patients have reported these symptoms for decades. But COVID-19 has amplified the problem worldwide. Nearly half of people with ongoing post-COVID symptoms – a condition known as long-COVID – now meet the criteria for ME/CFS. Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, it is estimated that more than 400 million people have developed &lt;a href="https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/long-covid-costs-countries-billions-of-dollars"&gt;long-COVID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, no widely accepted and testable mechanism has fully explained the biological processes underlying long-COVID and ME/CFS. Our work offers a new perspective that may help close this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research group studies blood and the cardiovascular system in inflammatory diseases, as well as post-viral conditions. We focus on coagulation, inflammation and endothelial cells. Endothelial cells make up the inner layer of blood vessels and serve many important functions, like regulating blood clotting, blood vessel dilation and constriction, and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our latest &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202505.1875/v1"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; aims to explain how ME/CFS and long-COVID start and progress, and how symptoms show up in the body and its systems. By pinpointing and explaining the underlying disease mechanisms, we can pave the way for better clinical tools to diagnose and treat people living with ME/CFS and long-COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is endothelial senescence?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our review, our international team proposes that certain viruses drive  endothelial cells into a half-alive, “zombie-like” state called cellular senescence. Senescent endothelial cells stop dividing, but continue to release molecules that awaken and confuse the immune system. This prompts the blood to form clots and, at the same time, prevent clot breakdown, which could lead to the constriction of blood vessels and limited blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By placing “zombie” blood-vessel cells at the centre of these post-viral diseases, our hypothesis weaves together microclots, oxygen debt (the extra oxygen your body needs after strenuous exercise to restore balance), brain-fog, dizziness, gut leakiness (a digestive condition where the intestinal lining allows toxins into the bloodstream) and immune dysfunction into a single, testable narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From acute viral infection to ‘zombie’ vessels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Epstein–Barr virus, HHV-6, influenza A, and enteroviruses (a group of viruses that cause a number of infectious illnesses which are usually mild) can all infect endothelial cells. They enable a direct attack on the cells that line the inside of blood vessels. Some of these viruses have been shown to trigger endothelial senescence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9533263/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19 disease) has the ability to induce senescence in a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells. Viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2, for example, sabotage DNA-repair pathways and push the host cell towards a senescent state, while senescent cells in turn become even more susceptible to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01097-w"&gt;viral entry&lt;/a&gt;. This reciprocity helps explain why different pathogens can result in the same chronic illness. Influenza A, too, has shown the ability to drive endothelial cells into a senescent, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39841412/"&gt;zombie-like state&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we think is happening&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose that when blood-vessel cells turn into “zombies”, they pump out substances that make blood thicker and prone to forming tiny clots. These clots slow down circulation, so less oxygen reaches muscles and organs. This is one reason people feel drained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During exercise, the problem worsens. Instead of the vessels relaxing to allow adequate bloodflow, they tighten further. This means that muscles are starved of oxygen and patients experience a crash the day after exercise. In the brain, the same faulty cells let blood flow drop and leak, bringing on brain fog and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gut, they weaken the lining, allowing bits of bacteria to slip into the bloodstream and trigger more inflammation. Because blood vessels reach every corner of the body, even scattered patches of these “zombie” cells found in the blood vessels can create the mix of symptoms seen in long-COVID and ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Immune exhaustion locks in the damage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the immune system kill senescent cells. They are natural-killer cells, macrophages and complement proteins, which are immune molecules capable of tagging and killing pathogens. But long-COVID and ME/CFS frequently have impaired natural-killer cell function, sluggish macrophages and complement dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senescent endothelial cells may also send out a chemical signal to repel &lt;a href="https://biologyinsights.com/hla-e-its-role-in-immunity-pregnancy-and-cancer/"&gt;immune attack&lt;/a&gt;. So the “zombie cells” actively evade the immune system. This creates a self-sustaining loop of vascular and immune dysfunction, where senescent endothelial cells persist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a healthy person with an optimally functioning immune system, these senescent endothelial cells will normally be cleared. But there is significant immune dysfunction in ME/CFS and long-COVID, and this may enable the “zombie cells” to survive and the disease to progress.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where the research goes next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a registered clinical trial in the US that is investigating senescence in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04903132?tab=history&amp;amp;a=4"&gt;long-COVID&lt;/a&gt;. Our consortium is testing new ways to spot signs of ageing in the cells that line our blood vessels. First, we expose healthy endothelial cells in the lab to blood from patients to see whether it pushes the cells into a senescent, or “zombie,” state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we are trialling non‑invasive imaging and fluorescent probes that could one day reveal these ageing cells inside the body. In selected cases, tissue biopsies may later confirm what the scans show. Together, these approaches aim to pinpoint how substances circulating in the blood drive cellular ageing and how that, in turn, fuels disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim is simple: find these ageing endothelial cells in real patients. Pinpointing them will inform the next round of clinical trials and open the door to therapies that target senescent cells directly, offering a route to healthier blood vessels and, ultimately, lighter disease loads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Packed with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and natural bioactives, these kitchen staples can support everything from heart health and digestion to brain function and immunity. Some even show early promise in cancer prevention, hormonal balance, and metabolic regulation, making them a powerful yet underrated part of a functional diet. Incorporating a diverse range of herbs and spices into your daily cooking may also help reduce reliance on excess salt, sugar, and processed ingredients. Even small daily amounts of the right herbs and spices can make a long-term impact on overall wellbeing, according to emerging nutritional research. While many have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, modern science is now confirming their powerful healing potential. Whether you're sprinkling cinnamon on oats or stirring turmeric into curry, small amounts of these ingredients can go a long way. Here’s a look at 14 of the healthiest spices and herbs worth adding to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Herbs and spices with benefits: 14 of the healthiest you should eat often&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Black Peppercorns&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black pepper contains piperine, the compound responsible for its sharp flavour, and its potential &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10894018/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab studies suggest piperine may help trigger apoptosis, a natural process that prompts damaged cells to self-destruct, potentially lowering the risk of certain cancers such as breast, prostate, lung, and ovarian. While human trials are still needed, the early findings are promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cardamom&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used in Indian and Middle Eastern dishes, cardamom is rich in antioxidants that may support cardiovascular health.

Research suggests regular consumption of spicy foods may even be linked to a lower overall risk of death. Capsaicin may also help prevent blood clots, although people with acid reflux should use cayenne with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cinnamon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon is a naturally sweet spice that can help reduce the need for added sugar in your diet. It’s been shown to lower fasting blood sugar and insulin resistance in people with type 2 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21480806/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Additionally, consuming cinnamon daily may help reduce blood pressure over time by relaxing blood vessels and improving circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloves&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their warm, aromatic profile, cloves are often used in both sweet and savoury recipes. They’re a source of eugenol, a powerful &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227624001510?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;antioxidant &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;that may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Traditional medicine has long used cloves to help relieve pain and support joint health, and modern lab studies support these claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coriander&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coriander seeds, often found in curries and stews, contain compounds like linalool and geranyl acetate. These have shown potential in protecting brain function and may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, although more human-based research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous for both its culinary and medicinal properties, garlic has been shown to lower high blood pressure thanks to its sulphur-containing compounds. Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/17/2895?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;report effects comparable to low-dose medications. Garlic may also offer mild protection against infections like influenza by supporting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ginger&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is well known for its ability to ease nausea, including morning sickness and motion sickness. It contains gingerols and shogaols—anti-inflammatory compounds that work similarly to ibuprofen in relieving pain. Ginger may also help reduce migraine symptoms, menstrual cramps, and arthritis-related discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oregano&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fragrant herb is packed with antioxidants like carvacrol and thymol, both known for their antibacterial and antifungal effects. Oregano may help fight off infections, reduce inflammation, and even support heart health. Some research also suggests it could have anti-cancer properties, though more evidence is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Paprika&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paprika gets its vibrant red colour from carotenoids and also contains capsaicin, which has been shown to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. This spice may help soothe discomfort by interfering with pain signals sent to the brain and is often used in topical treatments for its analgesic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peppermint&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peppermint tea isn’t just refreshing; it can also ease digestive discomfort. Research suggests that peppermint oil helps relax muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, making it particularly helpful for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its scent may also enhance &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8698652/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reduce nausea, and sharpen focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rosemary&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the mint family, rosemary is often used to flavour roasted vegetables and meats. Its aroma has been shown to boost alertness, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8698652/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;concentration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, and mood. In one study, nurses exposed to rosemary oil during long shifts reported feeling more awake and less fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turmeric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric’s golden colour comes from curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound. It’s been studied for its potential in managing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and other inflammatory conditions. Though curcumin has low bioavailability on its own, combining it with black pepper can significantly enhance its absorption. Its antimicrobial and immune-modulating properties help the body fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Za’atar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="120"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Za’atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend made from oregano, thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac. It’s rich in polyphenols, which may help balance gut bacteria by encouraging beneficial strains and reducing harmful ones. Za’atar also shows promise in supporting liver health and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;From antioxidant support to improved digestion and heart health, herbs and spices are some of the most accessible tools for enhancing both flavour and wellness. While more research is needed in some areas, adding a variety of these ingredients to your meals is a safe and delicious way to support your health naturally. As always, consult a healthcare provider if you're taking medications or planning to start any herbal supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/eat-these-8-foods-for-healthier-hair-skin-and-nails/articleshow/122882565.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Eat these 8 foods for healthier hair, skin, and nails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 06:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxOQVhyU2UwZ0oxNThZZlVDQWdxcjNVY1E5UkNETXJrWUdCSW9RMzBrMnNhSDV0TTdEbW5WZzdQLVBtU2RpVHFzRnFwTl9BNWNqNWI0U1Nkd3Rxc1hsR3ZUaFlqRE9SSkFadWczNlY3Mkp1dVEzNERHRVB6d0RTTVlyMXpDS1pLR1hDaG4yVGZkX3FSZG9iQ05paHVUTUpWaU9mdW12MC1Vd01IYUpPS0s3UnNXNmdpSnplTE0wdUhaQV9YU19hRFZ1bHdsRzhxVG1zb2I0UF9mYk40dnZ3MGJCQktkbzBlNTNXaE9SNDJLby1pdVZxZmYzbGwxVQ</guid></item><item><title>睡前一勺花生酱：美国顶级医生解释为什么这可能是有益的-印度时报 | A spoonful of peanut butter before bed: Top US doctor explains why this could be beneficial - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxPMjkySUpwS0tLVDk3TWthS3N1WXItdmROOE96ZlNyS3g2UHVvbHNzT3lqMWw2cWt3S1d6YWExWEVTZjM4MVVtbU53TkVQVVlhNFBfbHByZ2JXMHVCaUNfWVd5NmFoMXNLYWd3Mkg2YXBpVWpTOXhQaFlVbno5UmlxY3UwRGp1Z1FjWnZLTXdEamczRDJENzRuV3dXRDQ0NlRTQWZ5S0Ffelpxb0ZPLU45MTB1LXFEQlMyTkNaNjdUcFYwMU5FX2JlSUJMLXNoTkQ1VkF6cS1pNmFPSFBjM1U0cFBtZnIxanFhRVFWRVBTWkk3eWhwSzFFcWZpd2VtWXhLWVhhOGpydGZ5OEpiUlpuYlMzV0ZGUEdCZUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creamy, nutty, and delicious - peanut butter is a staple in every household.

Dr. Kunal Sood, MD, a double board-certified doctor, practising in Germantown, Maryland, noted that this habit has a calming effect on the brain. “Why would peanut butter before bed help you fall asleep? There are a couple of reasons. Peanut butter contains tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin, which can have a calming effect on your brain,” the doctor said, in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMVJugINp0G/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanut butter will also provide a good night’s sleep.
