			&lt;p&gt;The eyes can reveal a lot about the health of our brain. Indeed, problems with the eyes can be one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/"&gt;latest study shows&lt;/a&gt; that a loss of visual sensitivity can predict dementia 12 years before it is diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research was based on 8,623 healthy people in Norfolk, England, who were followed up for many years. By the end of the study, 537 participants had developed dementia, so we could see what factors might have preceded this diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, we asked participants to take a visual sensitivity test. For the test, they had to press a button as soon as they saw a triangle forming in a field of moving dots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who would develop dementia were much slower to see this triangle on the screen than people who would remain without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual issues may be an early indicator of cognitive decline as the toxic amyloid plaques associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154968" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may first affect areas of the brain associated with vision, with parts of the brain associated with memory becoming damaged as the disease progresses. So vision tests may find deficits before memory tests do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182034/"&gt;other aspects&lt;/a&gt; of visual processing that are affected in Alzheimer's disease, such as the ability to see outlines of objects (contrast sensitivity) and to discern between certain colours (the ability to see the blue-green spectrum is affected early in dementia), and these can affect people's lives without them being immediately aware it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/102118/text"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; early sign of Alzheimer's is a deficit in the "inhibitory control" of eye movements, where distracting stimuli seem to hold attention more readily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's seem to have an issue ignoring distracting stimuli, which may show up as eye-movement-control issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If dementia makes it harder to avoid distracting stimuli, then these problems could increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2023/october/dementia-driving-project-andrew-morris/"&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt; accidents – something we are currently investigating at Loughborough University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg" alt="An eye with two fingers in the foreground" class="size-full wp-image-144904" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's may show up as eye-movement-control issues. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEiiDPf6j0/"&gt;laurence soulez/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising faces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.419"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; which suggests that people with dementia tend to process new people's faces inefficiently. In other words, they don't follow the usual pattern of scanning the face of the person they are talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy people, this would be from eyes to nose to mouth. We do this to "imprint" the face and remember it for later. People can sometimes sense when the person they are talking to does not do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, some doctors working with people with dementia will recognise that someone has dementia when they meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost, because they do not purposefully move their eyes to scan the environment, including that of the face of the people they have just met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would follow that you would then later be less able to recognise people as you have not imprinted their features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this early issue in not recognising people you have just met could be related to ineffective eye movement for new faces, rather than being a pure memory disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg" alt="An older lady in a black jacket sitting outdoors" class="size-full wp-image-144903" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEEbnSYr4c/"&gt;ivanastar/Canva)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can eye movement improve memory?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as visual sensitivity is related to memory performance (even using non-visual tests), we are also testing whether getting people to do more eye movements helps to improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research on the matter is mixed, but some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33535921/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found that eye movement can improve memory. Perhaps that explains why we found that people who &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391311/"&gt;watch more TV and read more&lt;/a&gt; have better memory and less dementia risk than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching TV or reading, our eyes flick back and forth over the page and TV screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people who read often also tend to have been in education longer. Having had good education provides brain reserve capacity so that when connections in the brain are damaged, the negative result is less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_134632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg" alt="A group of adults on a couch watching TV" class="size-full wp-image-134632" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could watching TV actually be good for your brain?

&lt;p&gt;However, some studies suggest this beneficial effect of eye movement only benefits right-handed people. We are not sure why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these exciting findings, treatment for memory problems using deliberate eye movements in older people has not been done that much yet. Also, using deficits in eye movements as a diagnostic is not a regular feature, despite the possibilities in eye movement technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bottlenecks may be access to eye-tracking technologies, which are expensive and require training to use and analyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until cheaper and easy-to-use eye trackers are available, using eye movements as a diagnostic tool for early-stage Alzheimer's is not possible outside the laboratory.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/226356/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Some researchers believe it may one day be slowed or even paused, thanks to an emerging technique known as cellular reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiosity has surrounded this approach since a 2016 mouse experiment at the &lt;a href="https://www.salk.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Salk Institute&lt;/a&gt;, where progeric rodents (that age more rapidly than normal) lived longer after exposure to four genes that could rewrite &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy Xu, a postdoctoral research fellow at &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, has followed these findings closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-reprogramming-changes-aging-cells"&gt;How reprogramming changes aging cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every mammalian cell contains &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. However, the DNA in your heart cells behaves differently than it does in your skin cells because of the &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Epigenome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;epigenome&lt;/a&gt;, an outer layer affected by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;methylation&lt;/a&gt; patterns that can turn genes on or off. Over a lifetime, methylation shifts with diet, pollution, exercise, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22056670/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; discovered that activating &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cr200759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;four reprogramming genes&lt;/a&gt;, named after Shinya Yamanaka, can strip away large portions of these methyl marks. This can reset cells to an earlier, more flexible state, which can be good or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-and-pitfalls"&gt;Potential and pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have linked complete reprogramming to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22074-teratoma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;teratomas&lt;/a&gt;, which are bizarre growths that sprout tissues like teeth and hair in odd places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one early mouse experiment by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12586/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Spanish researchers&lt;/a&gt;, “many of the animals died within weeks,” which reveals just how risky total cellular regression can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In partial reprogramming, researchers use fewer &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2008309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yamanaka genes&lt;/a&gt; or cycle them briefly to avoid pushing cells back into a stem cell state. This less-extreme version aims to refresh &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; while preserving their identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-safety-is-a-concern"&gt;Why safety is a concern&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe there can be reprogramming. You’re practically telling these cells to become cancer,” said Charles Brenner, a scientist at &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;City of Hope&lt;/a&gt; research center in Duarte, California. Creating extra stem-like cells might be a path to fierce cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the odds of uncontrolled cell growth, some scientists use a well-known antibiotic to control gene activity. They turn it on briefly, then shut it off. The hope is that this approach rejuvenates tissues without allowing runaway &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt; division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reprogramming-cells-in-aging-tissues"&gt;Reprogramming cells in aging tissues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2975-4%5C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard in 2020 showed promise by focusing on eye tissues in older mice. David Sinclair, a Harvard geneticist who worked on the study, used only three of the original four genes – removing the one most associated with tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biotech company, &lt;a href="https://www.lifebiosciences.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Life Biosciences&lt;/a&gt;, has advanced this strategy by testing partial cell reprogramming on monkeys with eye damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm plans to apply for permission to do the same in people who have suffered sudden optic nerve strokes, believing the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44740-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic-switch method&lt;/a&gt; is safer than previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-closer-look-at-aging-itself"&gt;A closer look at aging itself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eye tissues seem like a controlled starting point, some labs also hope to apply partial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-cellular-mortality-timer-that-dictates-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reprogramming&lt;/a&gt; more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00183-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; at the Salk Institute used carefully timed reprogramming in mice with extra copies of reprogramming genes. Tumors were less common, and some tissues showed younger biological markers, although lifespans did not increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those results fuel speculation that certain organs, such as the brain, might benefit from partial reprogramming. Investigations at Stanford University &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00594-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; this approach in mice, aiming to improve brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targeted reprogramming boosted newly formed neurons, though the mice had an uptick in inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-questions-remain"&gt;Many questions remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique still prompts concerns about long-term effects and who will have access if human trials succeed. Some fear only people with deep pockets may benefit initially. Others wonder if reprogramming might lead to costly or risky treatments that never live up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists remain optimistic. They believe partial reprogramming might transform eye disease care, and later, other age-related problems. They acknowledge that verifying safety is key and that any therapy for aging must pass rigorous testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life Biosciences expects to begin clinical trials in the near future, and will use partial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reprogramming&lt;/a&gt; to help certain adults who suffer acute optic nerve issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say these initial results will guide future work. If the therapy shows no tumors or unexpected complications, it could open a path for new treatments targeting age-related loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I worry about the speed,” Xu said, noting that more questions need answers before the technology expands beyond small clinical studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-reprogramming-cells"&gt;Future of reprogramming cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows whether these methods will eventually slow or alter aging in humans. Undeterred, investors hope partial reprogramming can become a novel strategy for a range of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research continues across universities and startups. Many experts see partial reprogramming as a step forward, as long as scientists can balance rejuvenation with safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others warn that tampering with cellular identity may unleash problems we can’t yet predict. Even so, interest in these trials keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00594-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 12:59:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOLWZOUk11cnZTeUliSW1OREtKNUpMOS1aWFdNU3JjcWtHQkxYTzQwYXRrSG12ZGdtRG1neFY5ZUJZMmZoOFY0WGl2UGRhS0Rpemo3NjU2c0kyV2d0SVBOVGwta25BR0Q0S3hHMXJpY24zMFVnZmNDZ0Y5eGZGVXlHajQxNlVnV1hZMVRTdS1Ld3JVTHBn</guid></item><item><title>Researchers tie health of nine organs to diseases later in life - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOYjVMLWQzUVZKZnRsT1dFTkE1MldHRFM4WEZ2QnlyQm92ZGsya1BvdGdzQkdLUGIyRnV2TVpOZ0xoNGQ3NGVteXpMQTNhYWhzZ0k0aWlOV1VRZUtQeE5PUVM0ME9yb1NoU1VEenNvcm9Ub3NoS2pLZ1RmTHQzU21pZTloN0lSckg2aUxV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZTVOSCMBVDSHNWRH32OW5VEB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How old are your organs?

Then they looked at follow-up data that showed the kinds of diseases participants developed as they aged over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GM6ZKVU2ZZBBXEXTD4JN724TGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The organs aged at different rates in different people and even within the body, the researchers write — and those with “fast-aging” organs had an increased risk of 30 of the 45 age-related diseases studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q4WSQIPYIZBSXAYM2X4SOKK7XA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of the associations linked faster aging organs to diseases in that organ; for example, those with accelerated lung aging were likelier to develop respiratory diseases during the 20-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SPEETKC4TNDZDPP6ALIVWWEE6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But in other cases, the link was not as direct. Faster aging of the kidneys, in particular, was linked to diseases of the kidneys and other organs, such as the liver and pancreas, and accelerated aging of multiple organs in the body increased kidney disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJK4UN5LKJGE5EHZRMGUY2MLLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Surprisingly,” the researchers say, dementia was not best predicted by accelerated brain aging, but rather by the immune system’s biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4DUEA3AE3JFQTFZVSWF5DTY4ZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers say the study shows the promise of an organ-specific blood test, which is simpler than past methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SP5BTLH25FCTJC4ZFIBVCIPDBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a news &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074868" target="_blank"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, lead author Mika Kivimaki, a professor at University College London’s faculty of brain sciences and the study’s lead author, says such tests could one day “advise whether a person needs to take better care of a particular organ, and potentially provide an early-warning signal that they may be at risk of a particular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="S275FEG7KRFNPESUI5OTDR7PUA" data-apitype="header" level="6" id="S275FEG7KRFNPESUI5OTDR7PUA"&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 12:01:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOYjVMLWQzUVZKZnRsT1dFTkE1MldHRFM4WEZ2QnlyQm92ZGsya1BvdGdzQkdLUGIyRnV2TVpOZ0xoNGQ3NGVteXpMQTNhYWhzZ0k0aWlOV1VRZUtQeE5PUVM0ME9yb1NoU1VEenNvcm9Ub3NoS2pLZ1RmTHQzU21pZTloN0lSckg2aUxV</guid></item><item><title>A mom's sudden pain was a deadly heart condition.

    &lt;p&gt;Sara Adair knows the symptoms of aortic dissections. The hospital analyst's father and sister each experienced the dangerous cardiac condition, when the inner lining of the body's main artery tears and causes the aorta to come apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aortic dissections can be deadly, and are hard to diagnose. Both Adair's father and sister survived, but after her sister's aortic dissection at the age of 49, Adair was determined to learn why it had happened. She, her father and her sister were diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adair, a mother of two, learned the symptoms, saw a cardiologist and had regular scans of her aorta. There were no warning signs. On July 22, 2024, she spent the afternoon attending sports tournaments and a pool party with her kids. It was just another day in a "super busy weekend," she told CBS News, and she felt "completely normal." When they finally got home at 9 p.m., she sat down to unwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of a sudden my chest started to hurt. It felt fine all day, completely normal, then just all of a sudden this crushing, horrible, chest pain I'd never felt before," Adair said. "It was long enough for me to think 'Oh, is this really what I think it is?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudden chest or back pain that moves into the neck is a key symptom of aortic dissection. It was exactly what had happened to Adair's sister. It was a feeling she had been dreading. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The pain moved up to to my neck, and then I was like, 'Okay, this is it. This is serious,'" she said. "I got up to tell my husband to call 911, but I made it into the living room where he was and just collapsed on the floor." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Loeys-Dietz syndrome? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the body's connective tissues. Aortic aneurysms and dissections are a common risk for a person diagnosed with the disorder, said Dr. Hiroo Takayama, the chief of adult cardiac surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing the condition includes regular cardiology appointments and scans of the heart and aorta. Some patients may be prescribed heart medication, Takayama said, and patients can also receive a surgical treatment called aortic root replacement to prevent tears in the aorta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all Loeys-Dietz patients will need surgery on their aorta: It's just a question of if it will be a scheduled preventative procedure or an emergency one, Takayama said.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adair had been having regular check-ups, but the tests hadn't showed anything worrisome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd gotten all the imaging that I was supposed to, but it just wasn't detectable until it burst," Adair told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making a rapid diagnosis when "time is also ticking"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Adair knew what was happening to her, she struggled to communicate it to first responders. Her husband insisted that she be taken to the emergency room at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she worked. Paramedics conducted a diagnostic test that indicated she was having a "huge heart attack," according to Dr. Partho P. Sengupta, the hospital chief of cardiology who oversaw Adair's care team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite similar symptoms, the treatment for a heart attack is very different than what a person having an aortic dissection will need, and that's part of what makes aortic dissections so deadly, Sengupta explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over 50% of people (with aortic dissections) never make it to the hospital. Of those who make it to the hospital, their time is also ticking, because with every one-hour you delay getting the right surgery, you have a 1 to 2% increase in mortality," Sengupta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the emergency room, a cardiology fellow was able to make the correct diagnosis. Dr. Shawn Chawla,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who trained under Sengupta, used a point-of-care ultrasound to examine Adair. The device is a probe that plugs into an iPhone, turning the device into a portable ultrasound system. The scan showed the large tear in Adair's aorta, Sengupta said. Adair was sent for a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis, then underwent open-heart surgery performed by cardiac surgeon Dr. Hirohisa Ikegami. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know it was the ultrasound that I had in the emergency room that saved me," Adair said. "If I had been treated for a heart attack and brought, say, to the cardiac cath lab, or if I didn't go to the CT scan and get the diagnostic tests that I needed, I could have bled out." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recovering after open-heart surgery  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adair had collapsed on a Sunday night, and she didn't wake up until Tuesday. She said she barely remembered anything that happened after she fell down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation hadn't been without complications. She had had a stroke during surgery, which left her with some weakness in her left arm and slightly blurry vision. Fluid collected around her lungs and heart, creating breathing difficulties. She spent several days in the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after being released from the hospital, all Adair could think about was the night she collapsed and the terror she felt "knowing exactly what was happening, feeling it going up my neck, and knowing I had a really, really limited amount of time to get the right treatment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has spent months in cardiac rehabilitation and has several blood clots that still need to resolve. Despite the setbacks, she considers herself lucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the worst already happened," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing she fears now is what genetic testing for her children and her nieces will show. The kids have appointments scheduled to be tested for Loeys-Dietz syndrome. If necessary, they will start seeing a cardiologist who can monitor their health.&lt;/p&gt;

The cows were infected with the B3.13 strain of H5N1 — which has been circulating widely in dairy cows since last March. The cats were infected with the newer D1.1 strain, which is widespread in wild birds — and has also now appeared in a few cattle herds in Nevada and Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niman said he believed the two cats were based in New Jersey and infected last month based on the scientific nomenclature used to label the genetic sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Department of Public Health and Raritan Township, which reported a cluster of infected cats last month in Hunterdon County, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 51 H5N1-infected cats. They include both household pets and feral felines, and have been found in 13 states since the beginning of the year, including California, Montana, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and New Jersey. There have been more than 100 reported since last March, when the outbreak was first reported in dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250228a.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;New Jersey Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, the infected cats all lived on the same property. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/new-jersey-reports-h5-avian-flu-cluster-cats" target="_blank"&gt;One was feral, another was an indoor/outdoor cat&lt;/a&gt;. The living situation of the remaining four cats is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the genetic sequences of H5N1 virus taken from two infected cats were added to GISAID — the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data — a publicly-accessible gene data bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert at St. Jude’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said the discovery of the mutation wasn’t alarming in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mutation has sporadically popped up in other mammal infections over the past few years,” he said. “It’s an easy change for the H5 viruses to make and it does so relatively frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’ll become concerning, he said, if it spreads more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no reports of infected humans in New Jersey, and a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250228a.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the state said the people who interacted with the infected cats were asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Feb. 28 release said that the infected cats had no known reported exposures to infected poultry, livestock, or consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk or meat, “but did roam freely outdoors, so exposure to wild birds or other animals is unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak started last March, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;70 people in the U.S. have been infected with H5N1; one person has died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 10:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOMnc4YUVKdDhVVGU2TGhWX1NST1NjUFZhZGlGdzZsUU5udjZ4X2JQUFV0dlRpVzNkTlB0TURMWTE4THJqcVNpU0NjREt1X25FTGdPSHltYkNzLVRuVGdzNUx3Z2xMdUJRTkhFWWRxNUFTaVc4YzRLSm43dGxYclBDTGZfSHQyRjdHUnBaRnlxNzM4bHdIMzBmMWp6M3h2MUg1aDBMek1JT3FxNW9VamRjN0pUbjRjdUtGMmFLYVJDVC1LMHpjOVRvOE9rTQ</guid></item><item><title>The 4 Biggest Early Warning Signs Before A Heart Attack - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNclk4Y2NwYlZRaG5rVUwtWF94ZkZGV2cwWDlFSEtxODdlb3l2Sm1NVy10UDNYbEpvR09XdlpKSWt2UF92QUhwZmEtZUM1UkhmZmlZUDdmSkFOMzI3Y3czaUdjbjNtbUttcXlKV18tTWh2X2FEZ1duenM2QnE1eU9Eck9MU3h6MVVnRkhhN3JOaWNuSW5Xc1RQdEFIY3BNUdIBowFBVV95cUxQWE80bnNDOFNiOUFOZlZCcWF3MC1FWjJxRXI2T1VBMFE5c3NIRmFuV21lV0pOdV9WWVBnSXk3SktUWXRxc3VyMTZST0daUGNHRHFzRF9DZ0pkb3JxdEQ5MkVRWGxBbjdRdHVtWUZ4aDZ5ZWJfYV9MRW9QaVl0dWNJcUgtelQyUF9LbHBad2pVZ1ZSZ054dFJIZW9kMHVLaGR0ak9z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it’s well-known that issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and not enough exercise are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="risk factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d340fce4b036ac32c9ed27" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for a heart attack, many people may not know the early signs to tell if a cardiac event is on its way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say there are designated symptoms that happen in the days and weeks before a heart attack that can be a red flag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowing these signs could be a lifesaver.

Chest Pain Or Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Angina, which is intermittent chest pain caused by the gradual buildup of plaque inside the arteries, can be a warning sign that a heart attack or cardiac event may occur in the ensuing days, according to Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/roger-blumenthal" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Roger Blumenthal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d340fce4b036ac32c9ed27" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/roger-blumenthal" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Roger Blumenthal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A constriction or spasm of the arteries on the outside of the heart can also lead to this symptom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any sort of chest discomfort — angina can also show up in forms other than pain — it’s important to call your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Neck, Shoulder Or Jaw Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically we associate heart attacks with immediate pain in the left arm. However, early pain signs may not be as obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes angina is synonymous with chest pain or chest pressure but sometimes, especially with older individuals, there may be other associated symptoms like ... pain that radiates through the neck or shoulder or arm,” Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khandelwal said it can also feel like a numbness that goes up to the jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Getting Easily Winded Or Uncomfortable After Exertion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming easily out of breath can be a red flag, too, Khandelwal said. This could include feeling more winded than usual after doing a simple task, like installing a new light fixture or getting your garden ready for spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that some people notice numbness in the arm or chest discomfort after extreme exertion as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nausea Or Other Stomach Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdominal pain, nausea and overall fatigue are potential heart attack warning signs, too, according to Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/nikhil-sikand" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Nikhil Sikand" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d340fce4b036ac32c9ed27" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/nikhil-sikand" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Nikhil Sikand&lt;/a&gt;, a Yale Medicine cardiologist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. But that doesn’t go for everyone. “&lt;span&gt;Some patients may have mild or no symptoms at all,” he noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: ljubaphoto via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;ljubaphoto via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Chest pain in the month before a heart attack is common.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Frequent Or Intense Symptoms In The Days Leading Up To A Heart Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time ranges between symptoms and a cardiac event vary and can look very different from person to person. But Khandelwal said roughly two-thirds of her patients can look back over the month before a heart attack and point out a time when they experienced chest pain. Some people may notice worsening symptoms in the days leading up to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oftentimes, that day of, [or] the week of, leading up to [a heart attack]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can be filled with more symptoms,” she said. These symptoms can be more frequent, last longer or may even be more severe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any symptoms, it’s imperative you get help. Especially if the issues come on quickly and severely; then you should call 911 immediately, Khandelwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have no history of heart disease and notice mild symptoms, you should still inform your doctor, she added. Your physician can help decide what to do and arrange testing if need be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who get medical attention promptly — even after experiencing a heart attack — can get lifesaving treatment, Sikand noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Attack Prevention In Your Everyday Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many risk factors are out of your control, many are in your hands.

Officials said measles cases in west Texas and New Mexico now number about 300 and that two people have died — the first deaths from the disease in the United State since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/10/measles-is-spreading-are-you-protected/"&gt;Measles is spreading. Are you protected?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the risk of exposure to measles remains low in the Bay Area. The safest way to fight it is to get a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination shot if you’re 12 months to 3 years old, and to get two of them if you’re older than 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, but it is preventable with the MMR vaccine,” San Francisco Health Officer Dr. Susan Philip said in a statement. “If children in your family are not fully vaccinated, or if you did not have measles as a child, please get the vaccine for the best protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said California has reported five measles cases and that they all developed after international travel. They said there is no evidence that those cases are connected to the ones in New Mexico or Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious sickness and even death. It spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes and can linger in the air for several hours. Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and pink eye, followed by a rash.

&lt;p&gt;Bit by bit, scientists are unraveling the mysteries of gut health, and the more we learn, the more we realize how much the microorganisms living in our guts are responsible for, affecting things ranging from mood to skin health to hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people who have experienced the science firsthand are Alana and Lisa Macfarlane, who participated in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twinsuk.ac.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://twinsuk.ac.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;TwinsUK&lt;/a&gt; study and discovered that despite being twins, their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5433529/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5433529/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; were substantially different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went on to create &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thegutstuff.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://thegutstuff.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Gut Stuff &lt;/a&gt;to demystify the topic and help people improve their gut health.

If you keep a food diary as well, you may begin to notice trends or be able to identify foods that trigger certain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macfarlane adds that there are red flags you should be looking out for too, like blood in your stool, which may indicate a medical issue that you should raise with a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-eat-more-fiber"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

Thankfully, there are some simple swaps you can make to increase your fiber intake gradually. Replacing white pasta, rice and bread for wholegrain options is a great place to start. For example, white bread contains &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/174924/nutrients" target="_blank" data-url="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/174924/nutrients" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2.7g of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per 100g, compared with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172688/nutrients" target="_blank" data-url="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172688/nutrients" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;6g of fiber&lt;/a&gt; in whole wheat bread: more than double the fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have an issue like IBS or IBD, you have to speak to your clinician about fiber because it can affect people in different ways. You might need to start slow and work your way up to a higher amount,” says Macfarlane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-drink-more-water"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

The levels of microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) were three to five times higher in brains belonging to those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to an &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;article published in Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt; the discovery was "alarming" and warned this was "particularly in patients with dementia". And it said while it was almost impossible to avoid ingesting plastic there were ways to reduce the risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of studies over recent years have highlighted the increasing risk of consuming plastic. This has included microplastics affecting the lungs, fertility and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers published a study in Nature Medicine which found levels of microplastics in the brain are at much higher amounts than in other organs, such as the liver and kidneys. They also found that people in their study who were diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214" rel="nofollow"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; had up to 10 times more microplastics present in their brains than those without the condition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon's worth of microplastics and nanoplastics. And those researchers warned these microplastics were of a smaller size (&amp;lt;200 nm) and most often polyethylene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commenting on the study Prof Tamara Galloway, Professor of Ecotoxicology, University of Exeter, said: “Microplastics are a ubiquitous consequence of modern life, present in air, water and food and it should come as no surprise to find that most people have microplastics present in their bodies. What we don’t yet know is what the implications are for human health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Two things stand out from this study. The first is that there was no relationship between the age of the subjects and the amount of microplastics present in the brain samples. This is important because it suggests that microplastics do not accumulate continuously in brain tissues as we age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The second thing to stand out is the increase in levels of contamination over time, with a 50% increase in levels of microplastics present in the brain samples collected over the last eight years, reflecting the increased production and use of plastics over a similar timeframe. This is significant because it suggests that if we were to reduce environmental contamination with microplastics, the levels of human exposure would also decrease, offering a strong incentive to focus on innovations that reduce exposure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the problem with plastic?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plastic does not biodegrade but instead breaks down into smaller pieces - microplastics - which are eaten by animals. This means they find their way to the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They also find their way into our bodies through bottled water. And research shows even teabags are an offender for containing the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts writing in Brain Medicine said: "Given the widespread presence of microplastics in the environment, completely eliminating exposure is unrealistic. A more practical approach is to reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what can we do about it? It's almost impossible to avoid but there are steps that can reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;journal Environmental Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt; found bottled water was the second greatest source of microplastics - the first was the air we all breathe. In third place was seafood which the authors concluded made up the " large majority of microplastic intake".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers in that study believe changing from bottled water to tap water could reduce the intake of microplastics from 90,000 each year to 4,000. While the higher figure accounts for people who only drink bottled water and the lower for those exclusively tap water it means in reality most people will sit somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tea Bags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A separate study&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; published in the same journal&lt;/a&gt; looked at teabag use. In the past the bags were made of paper but this has now switched to plastic for many manufacturers. The scientists steeped one teabag in 95C water and it released 14 billion microplastics into the drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For big tea drinkers it could be worth finding which firms still use paper for their bags. Yorkshire Tea is one which has acted on the plastic concerns saying: "The bags in all our regular UK Yorkshire Tea boxes are now plant based. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Most of the bag is made from natural fibres like wood pulp and the seal is made with PLA - an industrially compostable, plant-based plastic which is much better for the environment when it's properly disposed of."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reheating or storing food&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Brain Medicine team the kitchen is somewhere changes can be made. It looked at levels of BPA - a chemical compound used in the production of plastics, which is released when plastics degrade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They advised: "Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption." They added: "Food storage may contribute to microplastic exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A randomised crossover trial of canned foods showed a more than 1000% rise in urinary bisphenol A (BPA) levels after five days of daily canned soup intake. This suggests that limiting canned food consumption and opting for non-plastic or BPA-free packaged alternatives can effectively reduce exposure. BPA spikes' duration and health impact remain unclear, warranting further research."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also said avoiding plastic and opting for glass or stainless steel containers may reduce intake. It added: "Heating food in plastic containers, especially in the microwave, can release staggering amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics—up to 4.22 million and 2.11 billion particles per square centimetre in just three minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Even long-term storage at room temperature or in the fridge leads to significant plastic shedding. These plastics show toxic potential, with in vitro studies revealing up to 77% cell death in human kidney cells after prolonged exposure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processed foods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point," says the Brain Medicine report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you get rid of plastic from the body?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Little research has been done on how successful the body is at clearing microplastics, say the Brain Medicine experts. &lt;/span&gt;They said: "One study of 20 people measured BPA in blood, sweat, and urine. 16 of the individuals had BPA identified in their sweat, with this being the only identified source of BPA in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This suggests that induced sweating could facilitate the removal of BPA, though further studies are required to investigate its efficacy and long-term implications. While some evidence suggests that sweat may facilitate the excretion of certain plastic-derived compounds like BPA, no direct research currently confirms its role in reducing the microplastic burden in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Further studies are needed to determine whether these strategies are effective in eliminating microplastics from the body."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team concluded there was hope that the body could clear the microplastic accumulation as studies showed there was little evidence to show the older a person the more plastic in their body. They said this suggested that despite ongoing environmental exposures, the body has mechanisms to clear these particles over time through sweat, urine, and faeces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added: "As methods for measuring microplastics in living humans improve, we can test the common-sense hypothesis that reducing intake of microplastics (e.g., drinking tap water, avoiding plastic tea bags, using metal or glass for cooking and storage, minimizing highly processed foods stored in plastic) and enhancing elimination may reduce accumulation in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In fish models, it takes approximately 70 days to clear 75% of accumulated brain microplastics, suggesting that decreased inputs and increased outputs must both be maintained for long enough durations to see measurable changes. As the knowledge increases, government-wide initiatives will help us reduce exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPaVVsZFV3SzVaUFI5TXFrN0RNVGk3dFF0dklXWjZFTXFpR0UwVlVyYzN2TmJPZWFnU0lieEFvNjJJcmM3TExYaUhDSjFZSVFtXzBCRjVKWkJkNXNqUHllTl9NRjFtTk9zb2tqWDFUVTRZRUJnOXNIYlplQk5KYVJpbTNnNnJMZ2kxX2fSAY8BQVVfeXFMUEVTOV9xZVZUTUJBdV96d1U4UU4wZFFuS2FZVGxLdURVcndvdTFGTTVCalJIZ190UEpoa1JPRS15N2l3VC11YkZVc1VwT2ZpT01GX3pqQW9UMi1DUzBLTlFhUVFjeEctYkxLRDFkWENDd1drSlA4V1c5SFhFUlBrSm1aRjV6STJHbndEbUZMazg</guid></item><item><title>OSDH reports 2 probable measles cases, potential public exposures - News On 6</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNdWpRbjc0cnJmY0k1Z0lFcVV6NFhzU3pQcXpBTjZibjh6ZEE3YzhuZnRrMm1HYkhBZXp4Zmd4R29ubEpJQ3k5RDN5RW5obDZkUXVhZHN5UENhdEpTXzExdkRIMDdLWlh2dGFNQjVKQnpZQ2ZVQ0RUZUhMVHNuNnRKYWFlTHpLRmRvN0MzSnVxTXI0SGtJQTRJRjdha2puYl9adFBGekszV0hiWWR1N1N0N2VOQnhOOU41dEx3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="viking-story-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) has identified two additional probable measles cases, officials announced Friday. The cases were reported on March 14, and an investigation is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the individuals were in public settings while contagious, potentially exposing others to the virus. The following locations have been identified as possible exposure sites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kohl's&lt;/strong&gt; (12405 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 1:30 - 5:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldi&lt;/strong&gt; (9259 N Owasso Expressway, Owasso) | 4:20 - 7:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walmart Supercenter&lt;/strong&gt; (12101 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 5:15 - 8:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/strong&gt; (12905 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 7:00 - 9:21 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprouts Farmers Market&lt;/strong&gt; (9601 N 133rd E Ave, Owasso) | 7:30 - 10:02 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowe’s Home Improvement&lt;/strong&gt; (1746 S Lynn Riggs Blvd, Claremore) | 7:00 - 9:27 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials urge anyone who visited these locations during the listed times and is unvaccinated, unsure of their vaccine status, or concerned about exposure to &lt;a href="https://redcap.health.ok.gov/surveys/?s=474CYE3F9F"&gt;complete this form&lt;/a&gt;. Health officials will provide further guidance between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those exposed who are not immune should avoid public settings for 21 days from their exposure date. Individuals experiencing flu-like symptoms, fever, or a new rash and who visited these locations should self-isolate and contact their healthcare provider before seeking medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSDH Epidemiologist-on-Call can be reached at 405-426-8710 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed these cases are linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreak and not the two cases announced on March 11. All four probable cases in Oklahoma involved unvaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per state law, measles is an immediately notifiable disease. Health care providers, laboratories, and hospitals must report suspected or confirmed cases to the OSDH immediately at 405-426-8710, available 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSDH is working with the Tulsa Health Department on this investigation and will provide updates at &lt;a href="https://Oklahoma.gov/health/measles"&gt;Oklahoma.gov/health/measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm897x4hk006n2cnt1riyebdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raw cheese made with milk from dairy cattle infected with bird flu can harbor infectious virus for months and may be a risk to public health, according to a new study from researchers at Cornell University that was funded by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000j2e6bap9lbrwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raw milk cheeses are those made with milk that hasn’t been heat-treated, or pasteurized, to kill germs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000k2e6b7iyiwzwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although federal law prohibits the sale of raw milk across state lines, sales of raw milk cheese are legal nationwide as long as it’s aged at least 60 days before landing on store shelves. This requirement, which has been in place since 1949, is thought to cut the risk of contamination, since it allows development of natural acids and enzymes, which were believed to kill off pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000l2e6br53sknd0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study shows that this aging process may not inactivate the H5N1 virus, however, and it underscores the risk of consuming raw or undercooked foods during the bird flu outbreak, which continues to infect dairy cattle, poultry and a growing number of other animal species.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000m2e6bvy1g3py9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The same group of researchers previously found that H5N1 virus remained infectious in refrigerated raw milk for up to eight weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000n2e6b92yvm61q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Diego Diel, who led the study, says he thinks the virus may be so stable in milk and cheese because it’s protected by the complex matrix of molecules around it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000o2e6bi0zn9p46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The protein and fat content in the cheese and milk provide a good environment for the virus to survive at refrigeration temperature,” said Diel, an associate professor of virology at Cornell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000p2e6bc33z24f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has said food doesn’t pose a bird flu risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000q2e6ba2tf7i4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The disease is not passed through food, so you cannot get it – as far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” Kennedy told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000r2e6bi221cmn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s only partly true. Cats and other animals have been infected by raw cow’s milk and raw pet food, and there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;three confirmed human infections&lt;/a&gt; in which investigators were unable to determine the source of the person’s exposure to the H5N1 virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89ai78u001w2e6bcz3khi8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been no confirmed reports of people getting sick from eating or drinking bird-flu contaminated foods, including raw milk cheese, but dairy workers have been infected by getting splashed with raw milk in their faces or eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000t2e6blud14bzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s still not entirely clear whether humans can be infected by eating or drinking contaminated food, Diel said, noting that his study wasn’t really designed to answer that question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000u2e6bi9c830a3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I do think it is possible. There is a risk of infection,” he said. “It obviously depends on the dose, how much of that contaminated product is ingested.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000w2e6bc913s4r5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may also depend on the strain of virus in the milk or cheese. Diel and his team tested the stability of the B3.13 virus, which originally infected cattle in the US in March 2024. B3.13 has caused only mild disease in people. However, a new strain, D1.1, which has been associated with some severe human cases, has also crossed into cattle, further increasing the risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000x2e6box7wrn0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the study, the researchers made mini cheeses with milk they spiked with H5N1 virus. They made these cheeses at three pH levels: 6.6, 5.8 and the most acidic formula, 5.0.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89bm2oz00033b6m2gedax3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then tested the cheeses over time to see whether any virus capable of infecting cells remained. They injected samples into fertilized chicken eggs, considered the gold standard test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000y2e6bc6dx771i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of the virus remained high for the first seven days after the cheese was made and then dropped a bit in the cheeses produced at pH levels 6.6 and 5.8. But importantly, the virus remained infectious for the full two-month aging period, showing that it was remarkably stable in the cheese over a long period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000z2e6b3yarcva9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those results were confirmed by some real-world examples. The researchers tested samples of raw milk cheese from a farm that had inadvertently produced them with milk from cows infected with bird flu. These findings also showed that levels of virus stayed high and remained infectious over the full two months of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Our study demonstrates that HPAI H5N1 virus exhibits remarkable stability throughout the cheese making process,” the authors wrote in their &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643009v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, posted ahead of peer review Friday.

            However, the study suggested that making raw milk cheese more acidic may kill the virus and make the cheese safer to eat. No live virus was detected in the cheese produced at the lowest pH, 5.0. Prior studies have also shown that common pasteurization methods inactivate the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experts said the new study was consistent with tests of the stability of the virus in milk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We have also observed that milk can change the pH needed to inactivate the virus,” said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University, who has been studying the transmission of H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We and others have repeatedly observed that milk will prevent the degradation of the virus on surfaces, and it increases the pH stability, such that a much lower pH than normal is needed to inactivate the virus,” said Lakdawala, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The FDA posted the findings of the study Friday along with preliminary results from its own ongoing sampling study of raw cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The FDA sampling study, which was announced in December, has tested 110 cheese samples taken from store shelves across the country. So far, 96 of those samples were negative by polymerase chain reaction testing, or PCR, which detects live virus as well as inactive viral particles, indicating that those cheeses probably weren’t made with contaminated milk. The results from the remaining 14 samples are pending, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The FDA is continuing to work with Federal and state partners to address the ongoing outbreak of HPAI A (H5N1) in dairy cattle.  The FDA has sampled a total of 464 pasteurized dairy products, including milk cheese butter and ice cream, all were negative for viable H5N1.  In addition, multiple research studies have confirmed that pasteurization inactivates the virus,” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle" target="_blank"&gt;the statement&lt;/a&gt; said.

            Still, experts say the study is a good reminder of the importance of surveillance – and of not consuming raw milk products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00172e6bb75aqn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is another reason we should push to ensure there is no bird flu in milk products and only consume pasteurized dairy products,” Lakdawala said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

High blood levels of molecules called acylcarnitines, markers of aging metabolism, were linked to faster cognitive decline and greater Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, lifestyle choices like plant-based diets and regular exercise can effectively lower these molecules, reducing bioenergetic age and potentially delaying Alzheimer’s onset. This bioenergetic approach could help identify individuals at risk earlier and provide personalized strategies to maintain brain health without relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bioenergetic Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; High acylcarnitine levels indicate an older bioenergetic age, significantly linked to Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy living, including diet and exercise, can lower bioenergetic age, potentially offering protective benefits similar to Alzheimer’s medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; About 30% of study participants with genetic risks but favorable bioenergetic profiles may especially benefit from lifestyle interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person’s “bioenergetic age”—or how youthfully their cells generate energy—might be a key indicator of whether they’re at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, new research from Weill Cornell Medicine shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Feb. 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, suggests healthy living can turn back the bioenergetic clock for some people, helping them fend off Alzheimer’s as effectively as a new drug called lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108144"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman, a clock and fresh foods." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s quite big because it means some people can lower their risk without the uncertain side effects of current treatments,” said senior author Dr. Jan Krumsiek, associate professor of physiology and biophysics and computational genomics in the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. The study’s first author, Dr. Matthias Arnold, is head of the computational neurobiology team at Helmholtz Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings bring us a step closer to solving a long-standing puzzle. One of the early warning signs of Alzheimer’s is that brain cells start losing their ability to produce and use energy efficiently, such as metabolizing glucose (sugar). But some people don’t show disease symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This delay between abnormalities in energy pathways and the onset of symptomatic disease suggests there is a “bioenergetic capacity” that provides a buffer for these individuals. Their bodies and brains are better at keeping energy levels up even when problems start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these cases, people can be unusually healthy when we look at their cognition,” said Dr. Krumsiek, who is also a member of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine. “They make it to old age without the kind of declines that usually creep in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could the researchers identify individuals with this beneficial higher bioenergetic capacity and help those without it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool to Predict Risk of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krumsiek and his colleagues turned to a group of molecules called acylcarnitines, which are associated with declining cognition and breaking down or metabolizing fats and proteins for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test if high acylcarnitine levels in the blood could predict who’s at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, the researchers used data from a large-scale study called the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dividing research participants into groups based on their specific acylcarnitine levels highlighted people with more severe Alzheimer’s disease and others with fewer symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led the researchers to define a bioenergetic clock based on acylcarnitines—how old a person’s metabolism acts, compared to actual age. Higher bioenergetic age is linked to higher acylcarnitine levels, worsened Alzheimer’s pathology, cognitive decline and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also quantified cognitive decline using a common test called the mini-mental state examination, on which a score below 24 out of 30 points indicates impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people with low acylcarnitine levels to begin with declined more slowly, losing about 0.5 points less per year than people with high acylcarnitine levels. The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some degree, a person’s bioenergetic clock ticks forward at a rate determined by their genetics, but having a healthy lifestyle—for example, eating a plant-based diet and exercising —can help keep acylcarnitine levels low, which means a younger bioenergetic age, Dr. Krumsiek explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went on to identify a subgroup of participants, about 30% of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with older bioenergetic age but favorable genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals may benefit more from early lifestyle interventions designed to decrease their bioenergetic age and potentially delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Dr. Krumsiek hopes to home in on the lifestyle interventions most effective for lowering bioenergetic age. For example, eating a low-carb diet may help maintain metabolic health, but just how low would carbohydrate consumption have to be for a person to see benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also points to an inexpensive, rapid test that could determine a person’s acylcarnitine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fortunate that these blood tests—originally developed to identify metabolic and mitochondrial disorders in newborns—can also help assess a person’s bioenergetic age,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can repurpose this technology for older adults, that could provide a way to start personalized treatment earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this bioenergetic age and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7113100145414145311c14155f121e031f141d1d5f141504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Prempeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Prempeh – Weill Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57032-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Krumsiek et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a systemic “bioenergetic capacity”, the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:44:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5jcEJueTBrSDdiX2h3d2Y5NlcxZEJKMTBEQjJVZzU5QnplTm9ndU9WQm92NjIyTG00YkNEU0oyNDJkLTlmYmtxR3NpaEhpZUNobDhCcE9VYjVqcDB3TnVORmUtVXctVGo4aUVBOEllVE0</guid></item><item><title>US measles cases reach 5-year high; 15 states report cases, Texas outbreak grows - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNeTA1X29qdV83SWt6UUdZNW44OUI0NFBNa1FqZ0RWaExSUmU0R2lCOG1oUlVfbUhvWnNoTlh6cm5nOTl2bmdHZU1tMjZhNWE0Z2FSVTFSSzROVDRUM3d0dXY3MkxLcTdWc3BYOUc1N0I5WVZBS0tXU3VIbmppZVpiN3JPM3FfellwdFduMjRMbWdSTFNZVDBMbkN6amVYbzQ0ZWJYSTYzZ28zNzdtRjBPbTl2UUlGOHkwVUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;The US has now recorded over 300 measles cases just three months into 2025, exceeding the yearly case counts for all years after 2019. The bulk of this year's cases are from an outbreak that erupted in an undervaccinated county in West Texas in late January, which has since spread to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-spills-into-third-state-as-cases-reach-258/"&gt;New Mexico and Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the afternoon of March 14, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas reports 259 cases&lt;/a&gt; across 11 counties, 34 hospitalizations, and one death, which occurred in an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl. &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico reports 35 cases&lt;/a&gt; across two counties, two hospitalizations, and one death. That death occurred in an unvaccinated adult who did not seek medical treatment and tested positive for the virus posthumously. The cause of death is still under investigation. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Oklahoma reports two probable cases&lt;/a&gt; linked to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, 12 other states have reported at least one confirmed measles case since the start of the year: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this year has seen three measles outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 13, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;301 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, which do not include 36 new cases reported today in Texas and two in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Measles is back”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, when health officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;victoriously declared measles eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; thanks to concerted vaccination campaigns, only three other years have had higher tallies of measles cases. In 2014, the country saw 667 measles cases. In 2018, there were 381 cases. And in 2019—&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/were-embarrassed-us-health-experts-chagrined-by-measles-resurgence/"&gt;when the country was on the verge of losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;—there was a startling 1,274 cases, largely driven by massive outbreaks in New York. Measles is considered eliminated if there is no continuous spread in the country over the course of at least 12 months. (This is not to be confused with "eradication," which is defined as "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm"&gt;permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence&lt;/a&gt;" of an infectious disease. Smallpox and rinderpest are the only pathogens humans have eradicated.)&lt;/p&gt;

In preclinical mouse models, terpenes such as geraniol and linalool significantly reduced chronic pain, providing promising alternatives to opioid medications and avoiding THC’s psychoactive side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terpenes appear to act through the adenosine A2a receptor, indicating a potential sedative mechanism. These findings open the door to developing novel, non-opioid therapeutic options for chronic and post-operative pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Terpenes:&lt;/strong&gt; Geraniol and linalool were the most effective terpenes in relieving fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opioid Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes could provide safer alternatives to opioids without psychoactive side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism of Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes relieve pain by targeting the adenosine A2a receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terpenes from the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant may be a viable medication for fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain relief, according to University of Arizona Health Sciences research published in &lt;em&gt;Pharmacological Reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds on previous research led by Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction member John Streicher, PhD, that showed the pain-relieving properties of terpenes in models of inflammation and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108140"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is showing that terpenes are not a good option for reducing acute pain resulting from an injury, such as stubbing your toe or touching a hot stove; however, we are seeing significant reductions in pain when terpenes are used for chronic or pathological pain,” said Streicher, who is a professor in the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson’s Department of Pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was the first to investigate the impact of terpenes in preclinical models of fibromyalgia and post-operative pain and expand the scope of potential pain-relieving treatments using terpenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher and the research team tested four terpenes found in moderate to high levels in &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;: geraniol, linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that each of the terpenes resulted in high levels of pain relief in mouse models of post-operative pain and fibromyalgia. Geraniol provided the most significant level of pain relief, followed by linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With fibromyalgia, there isn’t much understanding of what the pain state is, and there are not a lot of great options for treating it,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that terpenes may be a viable treatment option for fibromyalgia pain, which could potentially have a large impact and make a difference for an under-treated population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder that affects up to 5% of the world’s population, according to research published in Healthcare (Basel) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health estimates about 4 million U.S. adults have fibromyalgia, which affects women more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-surgical pain straddles the line between acute pain and chronic pain. It is usually short in duration, but it also involves physiological changes such as increased inflammation and sensitization of the body’s pain system that contribute to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Opioids do a good job controlling post-surgical pain, but they can cause constipation that can increase the chances of post-surgical complications such as adhesions,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are always looking for better options, and this study suggests that terpenes could be a novel therapeutic for post-operative pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, approximately 310 million major surgeries are performed each year, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research that is being done by Dr. Streicher’s lab on terpenes and their potential to help those who suffer from chronic pain demonstrates the importance of basic research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are hundreds of unique chemicals that plants make, including the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis&lt;/em&gt; plant, that are undiscovered,” said Todd Vanderah, PhD, director of the Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction at the U of A Health Sciences and professor and head of the Department of Pharmacology at the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Nature is incredible at making unique chemical structures, and many of these chemicals are unknowns when it comes to their abilities to aid in human health, diseases and disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great current example is medication semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, which has a chemical structure that was isolated not from a plant, but from an animal that is prevalent in the Southwest, the Gila monster. These discoveries from natural products through research such as Dr. Streicher’s can result in very useful medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the mechanism of action of terpenes on post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain was the same as in previous studies. Its action through the adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor – a receptor that caffeine targets and blocks – suggests a sedative effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher’s co-authors were Caleb Seekins, who worked in Streicher’s lab as an undergraduate biochemistry student and is now pursuing a medical degree at the College of Medicine – Tucson; Alyssa Welborn, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2024; and Abigail Schwarz, who finished her doctorate in Streicher’s lab in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health under award no.

Our lab found that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene relieve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy via Adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests terpenes as potential non-opioid, non-cannabinoid therapeutics. In this study, we investigated post-operative and fibromyalgia pain, expanding potential terpene applications to different pain types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female CD-1 mice had their baseline mechanical sensitivity measured via von Frey filaments and underwent either paw incision surgery or reserpine-induced fibromyalgia (0.32 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt;). After pain was established, the mice received 200 mg/kg &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt; of a terpene, and their mechanical sensitivity was measured over three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the potential mechanism of action, mice were given the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist istradefylline (3.2 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt;) 10 min before terpene, with mechanical sensitivity measured after. Hot plate pain testing was performed as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpene treatment caused time-dependent elevation of the mechanical thresholds of the mice from both pain models, strongest for geraniol, then linalool or α-humulene, indicating that these four terpenes are anti-nociceptive in post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretreatment with istradefylline blocked antinociception, suggesting the terpenes act via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R in these pain models. Terpenes had no effect on hot plate latencies, ruling out non-specific motor effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene may be a viable medication for post-operative and fibromyalgia pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mechanism of action via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R furthers our knowledge of its importance in pain processing and as a target of terpene drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:20:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1fYnh2RG1XR29lSlpnenhBQ0I2a245Y1lkRjdhOUM3ZjRMSVJsYl9GWFZvak5XWVJtNnpGcGdJem5lSEM2ekdSRXg4RjJzWEM2YUZOUGpTVFRXZDc4b3prRHo5emRYS1AyYVh4emFoY19aVGJGbWlEajU0WQ</guid></item><item><title>The 4 Best Frozen Foods to Help You Lose Visceral Fat, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPUUgzSkNlRzFmLUtoNTVLSDlZdEUwTUxmUC1PSGJhQWotZ3lPZUNIZ2NqX001RFJMT0JyTG5GQVQ0YVR5aWl1blZtZEJhb1h4OU9ta0tJemhSQVVpYzFITFF2RTR2VElleDJlQWF6dk1jZVl2UmdNcm9tZ0R0c1RLSUpMWXpVa0RxRzNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visceral fat, also called belly fat, can increase your risk for chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp, vegetables and berries are nutritious freezer staples that can help reduce visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For visceral fat loss, prioritize foods that are high in fiber, protein, antioxidants and micronutrients, like folate and potassium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While no one food or exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;target fat loss&lt;/a&gt; in a specific area of the body, several foods and lifestyle changes can support loss of visceral fat—aka belly fat. While visceral fat may be responsible for making a belly appear larger, its impact on health can be alarming and a good reason to try reducing it to healthy levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Visceral fat is a stubborn weight to lose and often is gained in the abdominal area of the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a weight-management dietitian based in San Francisco. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A high amount of visceral fat can increase your risk of chronic disease development, like heart disease, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome,” Han explains. Genetics, what you eat and lifestyle factors like low levels of physical activity and decreased muscle strength influence your visceral fat stores.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No one food will blast away belly fat (as many “wellness” products like to advertise). However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-if-you-want-to-lose-visceral-fat-8785221" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;certain foods&lt;/a&gt; may be more helpful than others for achieving this goal—many of which can be found in your freezer. Here are four frozen foods dietitians recommend to help reduce visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Shrimp &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen shrimp is a great alternative to buying it thawed from the seafood counter. Besides not worrying about your fridge smelling fishy, frozen shrimp is often less expensive, lasts longer and can be thawed in smaller portions depending on how many people you’re cooking for. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.annasmithnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anna Smith, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian for Lose It! and owner of Anna Smith Nutrition in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends eating more seafood like shrimp because there’s a connection between shrimp and abdominal fat loss. For example, one study found that adolescents who eat more seafood have a 26% lower risk of abdominal obesity than those who skip seafood in their diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to being high in protein and relatively low in calories, shrimp is a good source of many vitamins and minerals, including selenium, iodine, choline and vitamin E.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Keeping frozen shrimp on hand makes it easy to whip up a healthy dinner, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7919492/one-pot-garlicky-shrimp-broccoli/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot Garlicky Shrimp and Broccoli&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7959062/sheet-pan-shrimp-fajitas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sheet-Pan Shrimp Fajitas. &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A basic bag of mixed vegetables can cost less than $2, making it a budget-friendly option when you’re trying to lose belly fat. “Frozen vegetable mix is a classic household staple to support visceral fat loss due to its good source of soluble fiber,” says Han. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce visceral fat by increasing fullness, helping you eat fewer calories. It may also support fat metabolism, thanks to soluble fiber’s role in gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen peas are especially beneficial, thanks to their fiber and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein content&lt;/a&gt;. “These nutrients work together to help keep you full, making it easier to maintain a calorie deficit, which supports weight loss as well as visceral fat loss,” says Smith. What’s more, eating a diet that’s high in fruits and vegetables may help reduce inflammation in people with obesity and visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of fruits’ natural sugars, the myth that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068201/surprising-food-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit can cause weight gain&lt;/a&gt; is widespread. The reality is that while fruit does contain natural sugars, it’s also a great source of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber that support overall health and a healthy waistline, explains Han. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One cup of frozen mixed berries provides 6 grams of fiber and is rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Anthocyanins found in blueberries, blackberries and raspberries may help reduce body fat by promoting the growth of gut bacteria that help convert white fat cells into brown cells, which burn more energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only do frozen mixed berries cost less than fresh berries, but they’re available year-round and easy to keep on hand and use daily. Add a handful to your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7959466/mixed-berry-breakfast-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;breakfast smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, stir them into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mixed-berry-cheesecake-inspired-overnight-oats-8658773" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or add them to a bowl of yogurt or cottage cheese for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291961/10-high-protein-snacks-that-keep-you-feeling-full-longer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;high-protein snack.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The next time you’re shopping the freezer aisle, be sure to grab a bag of edamame.

They’re also low in calories and saturated fat and high in fiber and antioxidants, explains Han. One cup of frozen, prepared edamame has 8 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also provides 121% of the Daily Value for folate and more than 20% DV for both magnesium and potassium—three micronutrients associated with lower abdominal fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen edamame pods can be quickly steamed and taken on the go for a mess-free snack. You can also purchase shelled edamame for adding to stir-fries, grain bowls and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257315/greek-salad-with-edamame/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salads&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to losing belly fat, your overall diet is what’s most important. That said, certain foods may be particularly helpful for reaching your fat-loss goals. Frozen shrimp, mixed vegetables, mixed berries and edamame are budget-friendly and helpful to keep stocked in your freezer for healthy meals and snacks. Of course, what you eat is only part of the puzzle for losing visceral fat. “Diet is crucial, but so is getting your exercise routine consistent, your sleep schedule regular and your stress under control,” says Smith.&lt;br&gt;

The unit houses older, medically dependent men in four-bed pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other inmates in two sections of the same unit have tested negative at this point, but the unit is still being kept under quarantine and those in the two sections are being treated. The department said restrictions on visits and volunteer services to the unit are expected to be lifted by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is being provided following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes washing clothing and bedding in a disinfectant. The health department is also providing education about hygiene and preventing the spread of scabies to inmates and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scabies is an infestation from a mite that burrows into the upper level of a person's skin and lays eggs. It is typically spread by prolonged skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the health department said there has been ongoing issues with a skin rash, possibly caused by laundry soap, in multiple units at the prison that is not contagious. The rash makes it difficult to identify scabies cases without testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQlFuT2F0T0JkLTlETS1PcFU0VmVHUFp5QmNyd3pabDZ0SFo3bzNfTXBKc2gySmhDdlB5QXg4czZsTThOVjBHaXpueWVlYTZvWDFvLV9YVnR4RG5xcExYX0VZY1J2bmZpYjUxeHZ4bWpEa2ZIQzRLR0pFUVlxSHBBMTdQeEE1RnVfeWV4eGM0MTVzZnhfaWhmMjdEVzhIblFyLU4tQmtlalJxRC14Qy15ZTBYOA</guid></item><item><title>Aging might not be enough to eliminate H5N1 viruses in raw-milk cheese - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNNTdoRlpMUEJWd25tYkxrMk1ibDV3TG1lZ25UcFRUMVZlbWVGSXVWb3hjM29xeGhidWZEOWtWem0yUnNOdG85cWdPdnNKVVIwMmRsT0JwdTJWa2RrcXA2QXp1dWJlOVdFSnk0MlEzMDhmajcydm9Palo3UEZBWDBzbkF3RjlJczdtZ2JFM1hmTDNsb0Y1SldrNk5vOW9BZlplaHNEMlNSeDl4ZUdnNHRHMzllYVEzbDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheeses made with raw milk are popular in the United States and the rest of the world, and the products are required to be aged for at least 60 days to inactivate bacterial pathogens. The fairly recent detection of H5N1 avian flu in dairy cattle, however, raises questions about whether the same process can inactive the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer appears to be no, in most instances, scientists from Cornell University reported today on &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643009v1.full.pdf"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, a preprint server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the state of New York funded the study as part of efforts to assess the threat of H5N1 avian flu from potentially contaminated raw milk cheese. Separately, the FDA in December 2024 launched an effort to test nearly 300 60-day aged raw milk cheese samples, and today it provided an update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; today, the FDA said that, of 110 samples that have been collected so far, 96 were negative on polymerase chain reaction testing. Tests on 14 others are still in progress. No samples have yet to test positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study findings raise food safety concerns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Cornell study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, researchers made raw-milk cheese from raw milk spiked with H5N1 under different pH levels, ranging from 6.6 to 5.0—all in the acidic range. They also tested samples of raw milk cheddar cheese that was inadvertently produced with H5N1-contaminated raw milk after an outbreak in dairy cows on a farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cheese made with the spiked milk, tests show that infectious virus remained throughout the cheese-making process and for up to 60 days of aging at the 6.6- and 5.8-pH levels. The virus didn't survive at the 5.0-pH level, which is the most acidic, supporting earlier findings that influenza A viruses are sensitive to acidic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingestion of contaminated raw dairy products repeatedly may increase the probability of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators said their findings raise food safety concerns, not just for aged raw-milk cheese, but for other raw-milk products, especially given that the virus can persist for up to 56 days under refrigeration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the infectious dose of the virus to humans is not known, ingestion of contaminated raw dairy products repeatedly may increase the probability of infections," the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NYC probes infections in cats; USDA notes more poultry detections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other avian flu developments, the New York City Health Department today said it is investigating two cats in separate households that have H5 avian flu infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/press/2025/03142025-bird-flu-cats.pdf"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, officials didn't say how the cats might have been exposed. They urged people to avoid feeding pets raw food or raw milk and to prevent animals from roaming outdoors, where they may come into contact with wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials added that the risk to people remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported more H5N1 detections in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; in two states.

A giant pouched rat’s sense of smell is so strong that they could conceivably detect half a drop of chlorine in a space the size of 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools, says APOPO’s head of training Cindy Fast, a behavioral neuroscientist who coaches the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And while rats may be much-maligned in society, Carolina and her peers in East Africa have raised detection rates for TB—the leading cause of death worldwide by infectious disease—by &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apopo.org/what-we-do/detecting-tuberculosis/where-we-work/apopo-in-tanzania" target="_blank"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; at local clinics, where patient samples undergo a smear test under a microscope that is, according to Agizew, usually only 20 to 40 percent accurate.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have unveiled the first real look at a mitochondrial protein strongly linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, revealing key details in how its malfunction might play a critical role in the disease's progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1096284"&gt;have known&lt;/a&gt; for more than two decades that mutations in the gene for a protein called PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) can trigger early-onset  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="154962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, but the mechanisms at play have remained a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Australia used advanced imaging technology to not only determine the structure of PINK1, but to show how the protein attaches to cellular power houses and how they are activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154965" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154965" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram.jpg" alt="Protein diagram" class="wp-image-154965 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram-600x288.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154965" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PINK1 works through a protein complex called TOM-VDAC. (Callegari et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant milestone for research into Parkinson's," &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/news/scientists-solve-decades-long-parkinsons-mystery/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; WEHI medical biologist David Komander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is incredible to finally see PINK1 and understand how it binds to mitochondria. Our structure reveals many new ways to change PINK1, essentially switching it on, which will be life-changing for people with Parkinson's."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PINK1 protein is an important maintenance worker in the body. In healthy mitochondria, the protein passes through the outer and inner membranes, where it sinks out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mitochondria that have broken down, the protein is forced to pause half way through, tagging the power house for deletion through a series of processes that release a chemical signal called ubiquitin. When mutations prevent PINK1 from doing its job, dysfunctional mitochondria aren't cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain cells are particularly energy hungry, making the replacement of inefficient power units vital in order to prevent the neurodegeneration that triggers conditions like Parkinson's disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the team used techniques including cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to study PINK1 and mitochondria close-up, finding their attachment is based on a specific protein complex called TOM-VDAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, but if treatments to repair the functionality of the protein can be developed, that may then give us a way of reducing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;the risk of Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; or slowing its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've seen human PINK1 docked to the surface of damaged mitochondria and it has uncovered a remarkable array of proteins that act as the docking site," &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/news/scientists-solve-decades-long-parkinsons-mystery/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Sylvie Callegari, from WEHI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also saw, for the first time, how mutations present in people with Parkinson's disease affect human PINK1."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's is a complex disease, with undoubtedly numerous contributing factors. Yet by identifying the mechanisms behind proteins like PINK1, researchers move closer to understanding what the many causes have in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu6445"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They also say they are unsure of that person's vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the patient returned home on February 27, first experienced symptoms on March 7, and the rash emerged on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the period of possible transmission is from March 3 to March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say they have identified two places where the public may have been exposed. They are the Emergency Room at Henry Ford Rochester on University Drive on both March 8 and March 10. The second location is the Kruse and Muir restaurant on Main in Rochester from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles virus stays active in the air for 2 hours after an infectious person leaves. Early symptoms you should be on the lookout for include fever, runny nose, and pink eye. If you are experiencing any of those symptoms, you should not seek treatment without calling the provider first so they can take appropriate precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Video: Can adults get a measles shot if they don't know their childhood vaccine status?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know someone who seems to defy aging—people who look younger than their peers despite being the same age. What's their secret? Scientists at Osaka University (Japan) may have found a way to quantify this difference. By incorporating hormone (steroid) metabolism pathways into an AI-driven model, they have developed a new system to estimate a person's biological age, a measure of how well their body has aged, rather than just counting the years since birth.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Using just five drops of blood, this new method analyzes 22 key steroids and their interactions to provide a more precise health assessment. The team's breakthrough study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt2624" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, offers a potential step forward in personalized health management, allowing for earlier detection of age-related health risks and tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the body's aging signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging isn't just about the number of years we've lived—it's shaped by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Traditional methods for estimating biological age rely on broad biomarkers, such as DNA methylation or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein levels&lt;/a&gt;, but these approaches often overlook the intricate hormonal networks that regulate the body's internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies rely on hormones to maintain homeostasis, so we thought, why not use these as key indicators of aging?" says Dr. Qiuyi Wang, co-first author of the study. To test this idea, the research team focused on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/steroid+hormones/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;steroid hormones&lt;/a&gt;, which play a crucial role in metabolism, immune function, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A new AI-powered model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team developed a deep neural network (DNN) model that incorporates steroid metabolism pathways, making it the first AI model to explicitly account for the interactions between different steroid molecules. Instead of looking at absolute steroid levels—which can vary widely between individuals—the model examines steroid ratios, providing a more personalized and accurate assessment of biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our approach reduces the noise caused by individual steroid level differences and allows the model to focus on meaningful patterns," explains Dr. Zi Wang, co-first and corresponding author of this work. The model was trained on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds of individuals, revealing that biological age differences tend to widen as people get older—an effect the researchers liken to a river widening as it flows downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key insights and implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the study's most striking findings involves cortisol, a steroid hormone commonly associated with stress. The researchers found that when cortisol levels doubled, biological age increased by approximately 1.5 times. This suggests that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; could accelerate aging at a biochemical level, reinforcing the importance of stress management in maintaining long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stress is often discussed in general terms, but our findings provide concrete evidence that it has a measurable impact on biological aging," says Professor Toshifumi Takao, a corresponding author and an expert in analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe this AI-powered biological age model could pave the way for more personalized health monitoring. Future applications may include early disease detection, customized wellness programs, and even lifestyle recommendations tailored to slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study represents a significant step forward, the team acknowledges that biological aging is a complex process influenced by many factors beyond hormones. "This is just the beginning," says Dr. Z. Wang. "By expanding our dataset and incorporating additional biological markers, we hope to refine the model further and unlock deeper insights into the mechanisms of aging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ongoing advancements in AI and biomedical research, the dream of accurately measuring—and even slowing—biological aging is becoming increasingly feasible. For now, though, the ability to assess one's "aging speed" with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/simple+blood+test/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;simple blood test&lt;/a&gt; could mark a game-changing development in preventive health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative RNA splicing is like a movie editor cutting and rearranging scenes from the same footage to create different versions of a film. By selecting which scenes to keep and which to leave out, the editor can produce a drama, a comedy, or even a thriller—all from the same raw material. Similarly, cells splice RNA in different ways to produce a variety of proteins from a single gene, fine-tuning their function based on need. However, when cancer rewrites the script, this process goes awry, fueling tumor growth and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a recent study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56913-8" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the Feb. 15 issue of &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, scientists from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and UConn Health not only show how cancer hijacks this tightly regulated splicing and rearranging of RNA but also introduce a potential therapeutic strategy that could slow or even shrink aggressive and hard-to-treat tumors. This discovery could transform how we treat aggressive cancers, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/triple-negative+breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tumors&lt;/a&gt;, where current treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this work, led by Olga Anczuków, an associate professor at JAX and co-program leader at the NCI-designated JAX Cancer Center, are tiny genetic elements called poison exons, nature's own "off switch" for protein production. When these exons are included in an RNA message, they trigger its destruction before a protein can be made—preventing harmful cellular activity. In &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy cells&lt;/a&gt;, poison exons regulate the levels of key proteins, keeping the genetic machinery in check. But in cancer, this safety mechanism often fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anczuków and her team, including Nathan Leclair, an MD/Ph.D. graduate student at UConn Health and The Jackson Laboratory who spearheaded the research, and Mattia Brugiolo, a staff researcher who contributed his expertise, discovered that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; suppress poison &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exon/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exon&lt;/a&gt; activity in a critical gene called TRA2β. As such, levels of TRA2β protein increase inside cancer cells, causing tumor proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found a correlation between levels of poison exons and patient outcomes. "We've shown for the first time that low levels of poison exon inclusion in the TRA2β gene are associated with poor outcomes in many different cancer types, and especially in aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancers," said Anczuków. These include &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, brain tumors, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ovarian+cancers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ovarian cancers&lt;/a&gt;, skin cancers, leukemias, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, Anczuków explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anczuków, Leclair, and Brugiolo then went on to see if they could increase the inclusion of the poison exon in the TRA2β gene and reactivate the kill switch. They found their answer in antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)—synthetic RNA fragments that can be designed to increase poison exon inclusion in specific ways. When introduced into cancer cells, ASOs effectively flipped the genetic switch, restoring the body's natural ability to degrade excess TRA2β RNA and inhibit tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that ASOs can rapidly boost poison exon inclusion, essentially tricking the cancer cell into turning off its own growth signals," said Leclair. "These poison exons work like a rheostat, quickly adjusting protein levels—and that could make ASOs a highly precise and effective therapy for aggressive cancers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when researchers completely removed TRA2β proteins using CRISPR gene editing, tumors continued to grow—suggesting that targeting the RNA rather than the protein could be a more effective approach. "This tells us that poison-exon-containing RNA doesn't just silence TRA2β," explained Anczuków. "It likely sequesters other RNA-binding proteins, creating an even more toxic environment for cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies will refine ASO-based therapies and explore their delivery to tumors. However, preliminary data suggest that ASOs are highly specific and do not interfere with normal cellular function, making them promising candidates for future cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Hochul to temporarily shut down markets in the New York City metro area to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wet markets reopened in mid-February, inspectors have found the virus in birds at &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seven more&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s roughly 70 wet markets, which remain open and serve thousands of customers weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture, which performs quarterly unannounced inspections and bird flu testing at the markets, said it may order another shutdown if clear evidence persists that bird flu is spreading in the live poultry business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have highlighted the city’s wet markets as environments where viruses spreading between animal species can mutate and potentially become more transmittable to humans. While there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html?cove-tab=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;70 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu spreading to humans nationwide since 2024 – including one fatality – none have been in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Jose Fernandez at La Granja market in West Harlem earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, New York City’s wet markets continue to sell thousands of birds a month, according to state data from 2023. One estimate from 2021 put the total at roughly 1 million live birds per month. Several customers interviewed for this story said they prefer the fresher, higher-quality meat from these markets, while others count on them for halal or other specific slaughter practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="streamfield-embed streamfield-embed-default streamfield-paragraph mb-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘The meat tastes completely different&lt;/b&gt;’&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Granja Live Poultry, an unassuming corner storefront in West Harlem next to an artisanal coffee roaster selling $7 espresso tonics, is quiet from the outside. But inside, cages packed with squawking chickens as well as turkeys, quails and even rabbits line the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend an hour there and you’ll hear a half-dozen languages, including Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Bengali. Owner Jose Fernandez, who has run the store since 1999, said he gets just about every type of customer you can imagine – except one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have too many customers that are white people, because they don’t cook too much,” Fernandez said, laughing. “They eat in the restaurant, so their life is very different. In my house we cook every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;A price list at La Granja market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, originally from the Dominican Republic, said his customers are mostly like him: people with roots in other countries who are used to eating chickens raised outside on a diet of corn, grass, and insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The meat tastes completely different from the meat you can buy at the supermarket or butcher,” Fernandez said in Spanish. “People who come here know the difference, the taste of real chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many of his customers follow halal or other dietary laws, Fernandez said, which require specific slaughter methods he can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said he sells about 4,000 chickens a week, he said, along with small numbers of game birds and rabbits. The corkboard walls of his tiny office at the front of the store are covered with supplier invoices and the business cards of various officials at the federal and state Departments of Agriculture. He said his store underwent regular unannounced inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the shop floor, staff regularly sweep and hose down the tile. Behind a counter in the back, birds are plucked and processed in about eight minutes, returning whole or in pieces, encased in plastic and resembling the chicken sold at the Whole Foods a few blocks east (though considerably cheaper at $3.20 per pound versus $4.49 per pound advertised at the Whole Foods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Customers examine the live birds at La Granja earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Cardenas, originally from Ecuador, recently picked up two chickens at La Granja – “The Farm,” in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re better this way,” Cardenas said in Spanish. “For my health, I prefer fresh. When they’re slaughtered here and I can see the blood drain, I know I’m eating something fresh that won’t make me sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the risks of shopping at wet markets outweigh any benefits. While properly cooked eggs and meat are safe to eat, a wide body of literature has identified such markets as high-risk sites for transmitting disease from animals to humans – most notably as &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-03-11/what-caused-covid-19-what-we-know-5-years-later" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a potential origin&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live poultry markets create ideal conditions for this “zoonotic” transmission, according to Ann Linder, associate director of policy and research at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Animal-Markets-and-Zoonotic-Disease-Risk-high-resolution.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined disease transmission at wet markets in 15 countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds from multiple farms are mixed together, increasing the risk that one may carry a pathogen, she said. Because they are packed into tight quarters, often in stressful conditions that weaken their immune systems, they become more vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the ongoing bird flu outbreak, which started in 2022 and picked up sharply again this year, is largely concentrated in major “factory farm” producers in the Midwest, that doesn’t guarantee that the city’s wet markets are safe, Linder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Owner Jose Fernandez says most of his customers shop at La Granja because they prefer the taste of fresh chicken, or they have dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a constant influx of new birds and new potential pathogens,” Linder said, referring to the fact that birds are sourced from multiple farms. She said wet markets are especially risky because customers examine the birds up close and the animals are slaughtered on site, potentially creating more avenues for transmission. Additionally, she said that because wet markets often operate in dense, residential neighborhoods in New York City, an outbreak that starts here could be especially hard to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more bird flu detections at the city’s wet markets since their reopening than before the initial shutdown, activists, city councilmembers, and even Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa are questioning why they remain open. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to bird flu, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States there have been 70 cases of bird flu detected in humans since the current outbreak began spiking again in 2024, with one fatality reported in Louisiana in January. For now, the disease does not appear to spread easily from animals to humans, but public health experts expressed concern that it will mutate to become more easily transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally don’t think there’s anything any market could do to actually be shut down,” said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights organization New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birnkrant has been documenting conditions at some of the city’s wet markets for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds,” Birnkrant said of a store in Queens that she visited on Tuesday. “Many we found with open wounds because the birds are cannibalizing each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantal Fernandez, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Health, said that while her agency provides guidance to workers on proper protective equipment and handling dead birds, they don’t have a specific program to educate consumers about the risks these markets pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarra Jagne, a professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine who has studied Northeast U.S. bird markets extensively, said that strict regulations introduced in 2003 made the markets much safer, such as one mandating that different species be caged separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent cases of bird flu in markets are to be expected given the ongoing national outbreak, she said, but do not highlight an inherent problem with the markets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to many, many of these markets, and the change from before is just enormous,” Jarra said, referring to the period before the 2003 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at La Granja, Fernandez said the state’s monitoring and detection program is sufficient for him and his customers to feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand surged after the weeklong shutdown before business normalized and then slowed a little, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not sure why. It could be the economy, he said. But most likely it’s the usual seasonal pattern – his customers often give up meat for Lent and Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUzVLaU05UTdxLW1YdHNrbHVUX0l2TEtOTkxuNXNIRExtQVBqUUpqNUpkelZvSVZnbXNWc28wQVhrM3FyYkFwT0VxeEt0eng2RzlWSVc5VERrWDZJd1pCSFNncFVlWEY3aTRVUllpclhJZVRucVNTcHZ0QXZkRWFnS1BKcjRtbm80ZHo4Ti04Nmc5T1JvYkZ4eUpjako2dWc</guid></item><item><title>I was diagnosed with colon cancer and given months to live... then the most disgusting thing saved my life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQUVZnNEdWN1g3YnJCTFNxVjRlVm5WV3YtazRnZlN3eF9kbjNObVhhOTU3bXQteHN3aVdoeTM2V1RfNHNPOTNDNmZyenlNYWNmNnlodWwzRU9NZDliUG5KckhkLW1GRXAzb0FlbFU3TjZaOVJoTVQ1UUtVME90M3dabmxsREhBOVU4dkplUUpsNU5LNExCcGZoMzh2RnpkRVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tim Story, a high school football coach in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mississippi/index.html" id="mol-89f6b0e0-00e2-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, does not consider himself a crying man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when he learned he had late-stage colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-89e5c0f0-00e2-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and months to live, he and his wife broke down in their living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery and chemotherapy failed to eliminate his&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13933321/Scientists-discover-clue-colon-cancers-young-people.html"&gt; colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; four years ago, Mr Story joined a clinical trial for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-12926065/Gut-expert-reveals-poo-transplant-improve-health.html"&gt;a highly experimental&lt;/a&gt; treatment: fecal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was to be given a poop sample from a patient with advanced cancer who had been completely cured by immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Story said: ‘I knew I was kind of a guinea pig, but the only other option was staying at home, and I wasn’t going to make it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea behind &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11491145/FDA-approves-poop-transplant-treat-C-difficile.html"&gt;fecal transplants&lt;/a&gt; is that unique bacteria from the donor’s sample might help spur the immune system to recognize and defeat the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year and a half later, Story’s tumors began shrinking, and by 2024, he was cancer-free.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Minnie Hatch, 29, from Salt Lake City, Utah, endured years of recurring C. diff infections, which antibiotic treatments could not resolve. Ms Hatch is not related to Tim Story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Story received his diagnosis in 2020 when he was 49. He was diagnosed with stage 3 small bowel cancer after doctors found a tumor in his small intestine, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-treatment-gut-microbiome-transplant-success-rcna193721"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after surgery and various medicines, the cancer had spread to other parts of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early in his treatment, Story received a PD-1 inhibitor, an immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system attack tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's usuall effective against microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors like his, which have more DNA mutations than typical tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the drugs have been dubbed miraculous by doctors, this one didn’t work for Mr Story, leading to the plan to do a fecal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2021, oncologists in the US and Israel administered fecal transplants to 15 patients with metastatic melanoma to enhance their response to PD-1 inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment proved effective for three patients, with one, Mr Story, achieving complete remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sample transplanted into him came from an elderly woman with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been cured with PD-1 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Good bacteria is extracted from healthy donor and processed into pills or a liquid. It is then is given to patients using an enema — fluid administered up the rectum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Overman, an oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, said: ‘Her tumors had been growing, and they suddenly shrank by 90 percent, to the extent where we could do surgery to get rid of the last little bit.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman’s response prompted Dr Overman to launch the trial that enrolled 15 people including Mr Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a month, 10 patients received multiple infusions of the super-donor’s stool, with five also taking freeze-dried capsules for six more months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Story did not reveal whether he was one of the subjects who took freeze-dried samples. &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Overman resumed PD-1 inhibitor treatment, which continued for a year, monitoring their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone's microbiome is made up of bacteria and other microorganisms that help with digestion, immune function, and overall health. The makeup of the microbiome influences how the body responds to growing cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fecal transplants are most commonly used to treat Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infections when antibiotics don’t work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minnie Hatch, 29, from Salt Lake City, Utah, endured years of recurring C. diff infections, which antibiotic treatments could not resolve. After undergoing &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.self.com/story/fecal-transplant-c-diff-symptoms"&gt;multiple fecal transplants&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2016, she faced significant setbacks, but her persistence paid off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After several fecal transplants starting in 2016, Minnie Hatch faced setbacks, but by 2021, she was infection-free for three years, the longest since her diagnosis. Ms Hatch is not related to Mr Story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2021, she had gone infection-free for three years, the longest period since her diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're also being studied for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and colon inflammation (colitis). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suzanne Singletary, 70, of Shell Point Beach, Florida, was diagnosed with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in 2017 and underwent various treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When immunotherapy caused debilitating diarrhea, her doctors recommended a fecal transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suzanne &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/fecal-transplants-help-lung-cancer-patient-keep-colitis-in-remission.h00-159542901.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'I thought that was the funniest thing I had ever heard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Less than two weeks after the procedure, I started to feel a difference. I remember waking up one morning and my diarrhea was suddenly gone. By day 12, I was doing great.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite recurrence of colitis, subsequent transplants helped manage her condition, allowing her to resume treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Suzanne Singletary [left] was diagnosed with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in 2017 and received chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. Her colon became inflamed as a result of her treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some studies, particularly those involving immunotherapy, fecal transplant has been found to potentially enhance the effectiveness of treatments by rebalancing the gut microbiome and boosting immune function, which may help the body better recognize and attack cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After learning that his tumors had shrunk so drastically, Mr Story said: ‘For me and my wife, it felt like winning the lottery because before the trial we had no options left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This past fall, I’ve been able to go back to work for the first time in four years. I’m back coaching football and teaching schools. It’s my passion. I’ve missed it so much because I had to retire. Now it feels like I’ve had a second chance at life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fecal transplantation, while highly promising, is challenging to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One donor, such as the elderly woman who was cured, cannot supply the roughly 153,000 new CRC patients each year or the 80,000 Americans with recurrent bacterial infections who might benefit from a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the trial highlights the strong connection between the gut and the immune system. Microbes in the gut can influence how the immune system detects bacteria and cancer cells and defends against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MD Anderson has teamed up with Kanvas Biosciences, a biotech startup that created HiPR-FISH, a tool designed to analyze the connections between gut microbes and immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By applying this technology to study the super donor’s stool, Kanvas Biosciences identified key microbial strains, which were then encapsulated into a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Singletary, pictured with her niece, noticed a significant improvement after her fecal transplant, with her diarrhea disappearing. Despite colitis recurrence, subsequent transplants helped manage her condition, enabling her to resume treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pill will be tested in upcoming clinical trials at MD Anderson and other cancer centers across North America to determine whether it can help enhance the immune system’s response to PD-1 inhibitors on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Matthew Cheng, a trained medical microbiologist and the Kanvas co-founder, said: ‘We have essentially made a synthetic version of the superdonor stool and then optimized and immortalized it so that it can be reproduced and used in the treatment of cancer patients worldwide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A balanced gut microbiome has been linked to better responses to immunotherapies like the one Mr Story took for years by stimulating the immune system to fight cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Restoring gut biodiversity through fecal transplantation could boost the immune system’s capability to launch an effective assault in cancer patients, who generally have weaker immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rate of colorectal cancers has been climbing in the US in recent years, primarily among people under 50, as Mr Story was when he was diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 37 percent of colorectal cancers are in people younger than 50 years old, compared to 24 percent of those in people 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And CRCs have increased two percent in people younger than 55 since the mid-1990s and deaths have increased one percent since the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate for CRCs is 64 percent, but that drops to 14 percent if the cancer has spread, which commonly occurs in early-onset cases because symptoms are often not present or are misdiagnosed until the cancer has spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include changes in bathroom habits, blood in stool, weakness, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, a lump in the abdomen or rectum, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, constipation and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:35:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQUVZnNEdWN1g3YnJCTFNxVjRlVm5WV3YtazRnZlN3eF9kbjNObVhhOTU3bXQteHN3aVdoeTM2V1RfNHNPOTNDNmZyenlNYWNmNnlodWwzRU9NZDliUG5KckhkLW1GRXAzb0FlbFU3TjZaOVJoTVQ1UUtVME90M3dabmxsREhBOVU4dkplUUpsNU5LNExCcGZoMzh2RnpkRVE</guid></item><item><title>Science Amid Chaos: What Worked During the Pandemic?

The pandemic offered a painful crash course. Sometimes, it seemed that the science was evolving as quickly as the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So The New York Times asked experts to revisit the nightmare. Of the most significant public health measures introduced during Covid, which have held up scientifically, and which turned out to be wrongheaded?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The question is particularly important now, because pandemics that could upend American lives are inevitable. One candidate has already surfaced: bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Perhaps the biggest lesson learned, several experts said, is that recommendations during any pandemic are necessarily based on emerging and incomplete information.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study has put an end to a four-year-long scientific debate regarding the “Mysterious Lady,” an ancient Egyptian mummy originally thought to be pregnant and suffering from cancer. First discovered in Luxor and housed in Poland since 1826, this mummy was long misidentified as a male priest until a 2021 analysis suggested it was a young woman carrying a fetus. The same study also raised suspicions of nasopharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, a new examination by an international team of 14 researchers has debunked both claims, revealing that what was believed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process, and that there is no concrete evidence of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440321001746" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this latest analysis meticulously reexamined over 1,300 CT scan images of the mummy, offering a far more precise understanding of its condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mistaken Pregnancy: Embalming Materials, Not a Fetus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers from the Warsaw Mummy Project made a groundbreaking claim: the mummy of the &lt;strong&gt;Mysterious Lady &lt;/strong&gt;contained a fetus between 6.5 and 7.5 months old. They based this assertion on CT scans that showed a cluster of materials inside the woman’s abdomen. Unable to find distinct fetal bones, they hypothesized that the acidity of the mother’s womb had dissolved the skeleton, essentially “pickling” the fetus over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This claim was controversial from the start. Several specialists expressed skepticism, questioning whether it was even possible for fetal bones to degrade under such conditions. The new study firmly refutes the earlier interpretation, showing that the abdominal mass was nothing more than embalming materials. In response to the initial claims, radiologist and mummy expert&lt;strong&gt; Sahar Saleem &lt;/strong&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Live Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to “identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further disprove the original hypothesis, the new team emphasized a key fact: while acidity can dissolve bones under certain conditions, embalming fluid would have neutralized the necessary chemical processes, making it scientifically implausible for the fetus to simply vanish. The supposed fetal remains turned out to be four separate bundles of embalming materials, likely placed inside the mummy’s abdomen as part of the preservation process, a common ancient &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/archaeologists-suggests-ancient-egyptians-built-pyramids-with-an-ancient-high-tech-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="74443"&gt;Egyptian funerary practice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kownacki)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No Evidence of Cancer: Skull Damage Explained&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the pregnancy claim, the 2021 study also suggested that the Mysterious Lady suffered from &lt;strong&gt;nasopharyngeal cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, based on irregularities in her skull. This was another startling revelation, as it would have been one of the earliest known cases of cancer identified in an Egyptian mummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, the latest research shows that these skull deformations were most likely caused by the embalming process itself, rather than disease. The removal of &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/researchers-have-deciphered-the-death-wave-in-the-brain/" data-type="post" data-id="70741"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, a standard part of mummification, often involved breaking through the skull to extract soft tissue. This process could easily account for the structural damage seen in the CT scans. None of the 14 experts involved in the latest study could find clear signs of cancerous growth, leading them to conclude that the previous interpretation was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This misdiagnosis highlights a wider challenge in mummy studies—distinguishing between post-mortem damage, embalming artifacts, and actual disease. While cancer has been identified in other mummies, scientists must be cautious in making such determinations, especially when relying solely on imaging rather than direct tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Importance of Reevaluating Mummy Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolution of this debate is more than just a correction of scientific misunderstanding. It serves as a cautionary tale about the challenges of interpreting ancient remains. Mummified bodies undergo significant post-mortem changes due to embalming, environmental conditions, and centuries of decay. As a result, distinguishing biological realities from preservation techniques requires extremely detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The intense public interest in the “pregnant mummy” case underscores how sensational claims can spread quickly, even before they are fully confirmed. The Warsaw Mummy Project’s findings were widely reported as a groundbreaking discovery, only for subsequent research to dismantle their conclusions. While their work was based on legitimate scientific inquiry, the study demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary verification in mummy research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest team of researchers concluded that this case should “resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer.” Going forward, they recommend shifting focus to broader questions, such as maternal health in ancient Egypt, rather than isolated cases that might be misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

She said she was also experiencing dizziness, blurred vision, and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three women were found dead in the above hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro on February 22. DailyMail.com's source 'Jane' arrived just over a week later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The victims: Kaoutar Naqqad, 23, Imane Mallah, 24, and Wafae El Arar, 26. A source close to one of their families says preliminary autopsy results show signs of carbon monoxide poisoning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Excepts from a text exchange between Jane and a representative of Royal Kahal show the hotel assuring Jane's safety, insisting the women's deaths were caused by a drug overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she attempted to get up to go to the restroom, Jane said she collapsed to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I laid on the ground for, I’d say, at least 30 to 40 minutes because I could not pull myself up, I just had no strength in my body, it was the weirdest thing,’ shared Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane eventually gathered the strength to get up. She spent the next three hours seated in a chair by an open window before she was finally able to walk uninhibited again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five days after returning home to California, Jane says she is still struggling with headaches, a cough, brain-fog, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said that one of her friends on the trip has also been suffering from recurring migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the symptoms described by Jane are textbook side effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after reading a report by DailyMail.com earlier this week about Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths possibly being &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14487175/american-women-dead-belize-dramatic-twist-new-theory.html"&gt;caused by carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning that Jane connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It all started to make perfect sense because I was completely out of it, and I did not feel right,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Every morning after that, I felt like I was in a fog. And I still don’t feel right now, everything feels off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane is seeking medical treatment and plans to reach out to Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy to report her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends on the trip was told by embassy officials that initial tests found some rooms at the hotel contained ‘high levels of carbon monoxide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy have not returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review on Royal Kahal’s Trip Advisor page, dated March 1, complains of ‘critical safety concerns’ during a visit to the resort in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had a wonderful stay at Royal Kahal Beach Resort from February 17th-21st. The staff was exceptional - [the] front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, bartenders, and beach staff went above and beyond. The beauty of San Pedro, Belize, and the warmth of its people made this trip unforgettable,’ wrote user Naquana H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, I cannot, in good faith, rate the hotel highly due to serious safety concerns. On February 18th, our carbon monoxide detector went off with levels above 400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite informing the front desk, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the issue. Maintenance suggested turning off the gas, but the CO levels remained dangerously high. We were left feeling uneasy. The next morning, a friend reported dizziness, which we now suspect was from CO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While the hotel is beautiful, the lack of CO detectors is concerning. I urge management to address this for the safety of future guests.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The women's families paid tribute to each of them in a heartfelt statement on Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A review posted on Trip Advisor just over a week ago complained of carbon monoxide exposure and 'critical' safety concerns at Royal Kahal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it remains to be seen whether Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, Jane said she’s furious the hotel lured her into a potentially dangerous situation with false promises of guaranteed safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her heart breaks for the women’s families and feels remarkably lucky to have avoided any serious harm herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They told us everything was safe, and we believed them. We had no reason not to,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I can’t get the girls and their families off my mind. It’s heartbreaking. But it’s also frightening knowing the same thing could’ve happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Who knows what would’ve happened if I was left to sleep in my room for another few hours, or if when I fell on the ground I couldn’t get up and nobody came to check on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just so sad those girls weren’t afforded the same luck.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said she realized all was not well at Royal Kahal almost immediately after she and her friends arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she says the staff were incredibly welcoming and the property was serene, there were signs plastered all over saying the hotel would be conducting smoke detector tests the following day between 9 am and 3 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Then all the weird stuff started happening,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next morning at 9 am, Jane said maids let themselves into her room and asked her if she was ready for house cleaning after she’d just emerged from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she thought it odd at the time, what really stands out to Jane now is the fact that Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar had been dead for more than a day before hotel staff raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They were in our rooms every single morning,’ Jane said. ‘So I don’t know if they changed their policy after [the three women died] or if they knew more Americans were coming to make sure nobody else got sick - I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just found that really odd.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane left the hotel that morning and didn’t hear any alarm tests being carried out before she left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she returned, she found a worker with a ladder inside who was removing all of the smoke detectors from her room and her friend’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worker left the smoke detectors on the counter. One of Jane's friends called the front desk to ask whether they should reinstall them but were told ‘no’ and instructed to leave them on the counter where they remained for the rest of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on Wednesday March 5th and for the majority of the 6th, the gas and hot water were switched off. The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

She said she was also experiencing dizziness, blurred vision, and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three women were found dead in the above hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro on February 22. DailyMail.com's source 'Jane' arrived just over a week later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The victims: Kaoutar Naqqad, 23, Imane Mallah, 24, and Wafae El Arar, 26. A source close to one of their families says preliminary autopsy results show signs of carbon monoxide poisoning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Excepts from a text exchange between Jane and a representative of Royal Kahal show the hotel assuring Jane's safety, insisting the women's deaths were caused by a drug overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she attempted to get up to go to the restroom, Jane said she collapsed to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I laid on the ground for, I’d say, at least 30 to 40 minutes because I could not pull myself up, I just had no strength in my body, it was the weirdest thing,’ shared Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane eventually gathered the strength to get up. She spent the next three hours seated in a chair by an open window before she was finally able to walk uninhibited again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five days after returning home to California, Jane says she is still struggling with headaches, a cough, brain-fog, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said that one of her friends on the trip has also been suffering from recurring migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the symptoms described by Jane are textbook side effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after reading a report by DailyMail.com earlier this week about Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths possibly being &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14487175/american-women-dead-belize-dramatic-twist-new-theory.html"&gt;caused by carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning that Jane connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It all started to make perfect sense because I was completely out of it, and I did not feel right,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Every morning after that, I felt like I was in a fog. And I still don’t feel right now, everything feels off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane is seeking medical treatment and plans to reach out to Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy to report her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends on the trip was told by embassy officials that initial tests found some rooms at the hotel contained ‘high levels of carbon monoxide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy have not returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review on Royal Kahal’s Trip Advisor page, dated March 1, complains of ‘critical safety concerns’ during a visit to the resort in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had a wonderful stay at Royal Kahal Beach Resort from February 17th-21st. The staff was exceptional - [the] front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, bartenders, and beach staff went above and beyond. The beauty of San Pedro, Belize, and the warmth of its people made this trip unforgettable,’ wrote user Naquana H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, I cannot, in good faith, rate the hotel highly due to serious safety concerns. On February 18th, our carbon monoxide detector went off with levels above 400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite informing the front desk, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the issue. Maintenance suggested turning off the gas, but the CO levels remained dangerously high. We were left feeling uneasy. The next morning, a friend reported dizziness, which we now suspect was from CO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While the hotel is beautiful, the lack of CO detectors is concerning. I urge management to address this for the safety of future guests.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The women's families paid tribute to each of them in a heartfelt statement on Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A review posted on Trip Advisor just over a week ago complained of carbon monoxide exposure and 'critical' safety concerns at Royal Kahal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it remains to be seen whether Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, Jane said she’s furious the hotel lured her into a potentially dangerous situation with false promises of guaranteed safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her heart breaks for the women’s families and feels remarkably lucky to have avoided any serious harm herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They told us everything was safe, and we believed them. We had no reason not to,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I can’t get the girls and their families off my mind. It’s heartbreaking. But it’s also frightening knowing the same thing could’ve happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Who knows what would’ve happened if I was left to sleep in my room for another few hours, or if when I fell on the ground I couldn’t get up and nobody came to check on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just so sad those girls weren’t afforded the same luck.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said she realized all was not well at Royal Kahal almost immediately after she and her friends arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she says the staff were incredibly welcoming and the property was serene, there were signs plastered all over saying the hotel would be conducting smoke detector tests the following day between 9 am and 3 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Then all the weird stuff started happening,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next morning at 9 am, Jane said maids let themselves into her room and asked her if she was ready for house cleaning after she’d just emerged from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she thought it odd at the time, what really stands out to Jane now is the fact that Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar had been dead for more than a day before hotel staff raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They were in our rooms every single morning,’ Jane said. ‘So I don’t know if they changed their policy after [the three women died] or if they knew more Americans were coming to make sure nobody else got sick - I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just found that really odd.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane left the hotel that morning and didn’t hear any alarm tests being carried out before she left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she returned, she found a worker with a ladder inside who was removing all of the smoke detectors from her room and her friend’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worker left the smoke detectors on the counter. One of Jane's friends called the front desk to ask whether they should reinstall them but were told ‘no’ and instructed to leave them on the counter where they remained for the rest of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on Wednesday March 5th and for the majority of the 6th, the gas and hot water were switched off. The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

Five years ago, at age 46, just as the other big “C” was hitting the United States, I found a lump in my breast. I was reminded of this last month when I had my bi-yearly scans, which showed (thankfully) I’m still cancer-free. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five years is a big deal in cancer terms because if you make it that long without any recurrence, the chances of it coming back drop significantly. When I announced this news to a group of friends, it was met with encouraging sentiments and applause. I was touched but not surprised. I knew that “C” was the one I could talk about; it was the other one I couldn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned this lesson early on, in the spring of 2021, sitting at a barbecue. After surgery and treatments, I had been quarantined in my house for almost a year, and this was one of my first social outings. Perched on an outdoor sofa, I listened to two women beside me talk about how the virus had affected their children’s sports schedules and how boring their social lives had been during the last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Enough is enough,” one of them said with so much conviction you’d think she was a lawyer trying a case. “The whole thing was a bunch of bullshit!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I excused myself, went to the bathroom, sat on a closed toilet seat, and cried. Had we just had the same year? It felt like they must have been living in some kind of parallel universe. Did they not understand what it was like in the hospital? How could they want to just go on with their lives without at least acknowledging the depth of what had just happened to the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memories from those early days of COVID haunted me: the sidewalk outside the hospital where I sobbed as I hugged my husband goodbye on the day of my surgery. The terror in every set of eyes I met once inside. The empty hallways. The workers in full PPE. The way the nurses would do their best &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to touch me. The patient who was rolled past me in a hospital bed with a plastic hood over his head. The caution tape. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the doctor said, “If you get the virus, we won’t be able to treat you.” How I scrubbed my skin raw each time I returned home. How I laid awake night after night, wondering if tomorrow would be the day I’d catch the virus and die. How I needed a good mask, but there were none to buy and watched protesters on the news raging against having to wear one at all. How the government said not to panic, but more people got sick and died. And how the president said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZgJZgFZbU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Just stay calm.

The consensus seemed to be that we, as a society, needed to move on from COVID as fast as possible without looking back — no time for reflection, no time for empathy, no time for remembrance. And for the most part, we did just that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were indications this may not have been the best plan — after the pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cases of depression and anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d325d0e4b0e72dd7fee7df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cases of depression and anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; rose significantly.

This thing that happened was in my DNA now whether I wanted it to be or not. And although I could see the attraction to put the blinders on, I just couldn’t seem to keep them up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The empty hospital where the author received treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It started with anxiety attacks in crowded places. It moved on to ruminating over the slightest changes in my body — a tickle in my throat, a headache, a sneeze. The COVID and the cancer were enmeshed in my mind, so much so that a part of me believed if I succumbed to the first, the other would surely follow. My thoughts, which before the pandemic, had been filled with things like work assignments, my own kid’s game schedules and social plans, were overtaken by an all-consuming fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when friends asked, “How are you doing?” I always replied, “Good,” because that is what I should’ve been, even if I wasn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logic told me if I acted like the person I was in March of 2020, I would become her again. So, I said yes when I got invitations, even though I wanted to say no. I smiled through cocktail parties and work events. I told myself: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is what people do, and the more you do it, the easier it will get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I took the subway, went to the theater, traveled, and said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If all these other people are doing it, it must be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even when, amid those things, I did get a mild case of COVID and recovered, the anxiety remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The aftermath of a traumatic event can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and problems with emotional regulation (such as irritability and anger). I was experiencing almost all of those things and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew I couldn’t suppress them any longer, so I began therapy. Week after week, I told my story, and as I did, the worry finally began to fade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned that a common coping mechanism when people experience trauma is a detachment from thoughts and feelings. And as I grasped how this was true in relation to myself, I started to wonder: Is that what we, as a society, have done as well? After enduring one period of isolation, did we forgo grieving collectively in the aftermath to avoid feeling things that were too hard to hold? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, I live very much the way I did before COVID and cancer, but at times, I still feel my body tensing around crowds and unpredictable situations. And although I now have the tools to manage these moments, I wonder if they will ever go away. Just as having cancer has forever changed me, COVID did, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am not the same person I was before March of 2020, and neither are you. Whether we like it or not, we have all been changed by the other big “C.” Our COVID stories matter — whether they be from a first grader who missed their little league season, a teenager who had to do school online from the confines of their bedroom, a frontline worker, a grandparent who went a year without a hug, a once healthy adult who now suffers from long COVID, or one of the millions of people who lost a loved one. These experiences shaped us into the people we are today, they are a part of us now. To say those truths out loud is to know we were never alone, even when we were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping well is vital for energy and good health — but getting the right amount of different stages of sleep can make all the difference. Among the various sleep stages, two of the most well-known are REM sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is closely associated with cognition and emotions (not to mention vivid dreams). Meanwhile, deep sleep is crucial for immune function, physical restoration, and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need different amounts of each, and cycling through all of the sleep stages, including light sleep (also known as NREM 1 and NREM 2) is important to wake up feeling your best and promote good health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, we’re diving into all things REM sleep vs deep sleep for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025"&gt;Sleep Awareness Week 2025&lt;/a&gt; — including what happens during each stage, when they occur, how much of each we need. Plus, we'll offer our top tips on how to get more of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-rem-sleep-3"&gt;What is REM sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is a stage of sleep defined by rapid eye movement. Per a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, REM sleep “is a behavioral state, a brain state, a dream state, and a paradoxical state,” which highlights its status as perhaps the most unique sleep stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s typically classified as its own category compared to NREM sleep (aka non-REM sleep), the latter of which has three stages that include light sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During REM sleep, your brain is almost as active as when you’re awake, says &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Raj Dasgupta, MD, FACP, FCCP, FAASM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical advisor for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sleepopolis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a quadruple board certified physician in internal medicine, pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-deep-sleep-3"&gt;What is deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep is also known as slow-wave sleep, as your brain waves notably slow down to prompt significant rest and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deep sleep is the most physically restorative stage,” says Dr Dasgupta, underscoring its importance to not only help you wake up feeling refreshed but also support overall health and vitality over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Since it’s such a deep state, waking up from it can leave you feeling groggy,” he adds. Moreover, if you don’t get enough deep sleep, you may feel foggy and fatigued the next day — even if you logged the requisite &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 to 9 hours of sleep per night&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that most adults need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-what-do-they-both-do"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: What do they both do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stages are equally as important for us to wake up feeling rested and restored, ready for another day ahead. However, each take on very different roles to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-rem-sleep-3"&gt;The role of REM sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is when most vivid dreaming happens,” says Dr Dasgupta. “Your voluntary muscles stay paralyzed so you don’t act out dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: You can dream during other stages of sleep, but those dreams may be more fragmented and easier to forget upon waking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is key for memory, learning, and emotional processing,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-deep-sleep-3"&gt;The role of deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep — also called the N3 stage of NREM sleep — is arguably the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most important sleep stage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During deep sleep, your brain waves slow way down, your body repairs itself, and your immune system gets a boost,” Dr Dasgupta shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is also when growth hormones are released,” he adds. This means deep sleep is essential for physical recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-when-do-they-occur"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: When do they occur?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cycle through different sleep stages throughout the night, with REM sleep occurring about 90 minutes after you fall asleep,” Dr Dasgupta explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first REM period is usually short, while subsequent REM stages gradually lengthen as you approach the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first REM stage may be only a few minutes in length while the final REM stage &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;can last up to an hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, deep sleep happens mostly in the first half of the night, says Dr Dasgupta. Since we need enough deep sleep to feel rested — not to mention facilitate major repair and restoration of the brain and body — it makes sense we 'bank' it as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-how-much-do-we-need"&gt;&lt;span&gt; REM sleep vs Deep sleep: How much do we need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-rem-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much REM sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, REM typically accounts for around 25% of all sleep, or about 90 to 120 minutes per night. However, this requirement varies on a range of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Age, genetics, stress levels, and lifestyle all play a role,” Dr Dasgupta shares, each of which will dictate whether you need more or less REM sleep to feel and function your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep habits, alcohol, and an inconsistent schedule can throw things off, making it harder to get the right balance of sleep stages,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-deep-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much deep sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound surprising due to deep sleep’s major influence on restoration, immunity, and brain health, but we actually need less of this sleep stage compared to REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most adults need about 1 to 2 hours of deep sleep per night,” says Dr Dasgupta, “but this isn’t an exact science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the ideal amount of deep sleep for you — as well as how much you’ll typically get — will vary on a host of factors such as your age, health conditions, medications, and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age,” he adds, so you naturally might log less of it in older adulthood than you did in your 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up, with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; that deep sleep (among other elements of sleep architecture) decreased up until the age of 60, when it appeared to plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more REM sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can’t exactly train yourself to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;get more REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are a number of lifestyle tips and tricks you can adopt to achieve more high-quality sleep on the whole, and thus increase likelihood of getting more REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="keep-a-regular-sleep-schedule-3"&gt;Keep a regular sleep schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want better sleep, consistency is key,” says Dr Dasgupta. As such, sticking to a regular sleep schedule is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it may be to cave into a late-night TV binging session or sleep in when you get the chance, inconsistent sleep and wake times are one of the biggest instigators getting in the way of solid rest each and every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Waking up at the same time each morning — even if you had a poor night’s rest prior — is wise since it’ll encourage sleepiness come bedtime, thus helping you bounce back to your regular sleeping window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-caffeine-and-alcohol-3"&gt;Avoid caffeine and alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dasgutpa also advises limiting caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening. However, it’ll be in your best interest scaling back caffeine earlier in the day — with research suggesting at least &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 hours before bedtime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to avoid sleep disruptions, though this will also vary based on your sensitivity to caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount will also impact your REM sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of healthy men published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biological Rhythms&lt;/em&gt; in 2021 found that participants who had 150 milligrams of caffeine three times daily over 10 days experienced delays in REM sleep, as well as greater difficulty waking up and feeling sleepy when they did, compared to a group that underwent caffeine withdrawal, and a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, alcohol &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces the amount of REM sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you get — not to mention contributes to nighttime awakenings and lowers your overall sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="manage-stress-and-anxiety-3"&gt;Manage stress and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and anxiety are likely to get in the way of achieving a good night’s rest and a healthy balance of sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that when experimental stressors were applied in studies, REM sleep, deep sleep and sleep efficiency were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that major stressors may increase REM sleep but reduce deep sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;REM rebound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is when we spend more time in REM sleep, may help mental recovery; however, losing deep sleep in the process will be disadvantageous for your energy levels, physical restoration, and long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Dr Dasgupta advises managing stress through your preferred relaxation techniques — be it reading, meditating, listening to music, doing gentle yoga, or another method — if worry and rumination lead you to have trouble falling asleep or feel poorly rested upon waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-deep-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more deep sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with REM sleep, you can’t will yourself to boost the amount of deep sleep you get every night.

This is especially beneficial to normalize your circadian rhythm (aka your sleep-wake cycles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight indicates that it’s time to wake up and will supress melatonin (aka the sleep hormone) production to give you more energy for you morning and afternoon&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/light-mornings-are-the-answer-to-better-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/light-mornings-are-the-answer-to-better-sleep"&gt;daylight as early in the day&lt;/a&gt; as possible will also help ensure that melatonin will release at the right time in the evening so you’re primed for sleepiness and snoozing come bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="increase-exercise-during-the-day-3"&gt;Increase exercise during the day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;Exercise can improve your sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Dasgupta advises staying active during the day, which will also play a role in regulating your circadian rhythm. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270305/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270305/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that boosting your daytime energy expenditure is an effective way to increase deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t make it to the gym or a workout class, you can simply increase your step count throughout the day. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;One 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; showed this improved sleep efficiency, reduce stress, and lower daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To encourage deep sleep, Dr Dasgupta also advises refraining from intense activity too close to bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While daytime exercise &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904822/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904822/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can increase deep sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and decrease the time it takes to fall asleep, intense nighttime workouts may have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="create-an-ideal-environment-for-sleep-3"&gt;Create an ideal environment for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, your overall sleep environment will have a major influence on how quickly you fall asleep and how restful your ZZZ’s can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’ll want to invest in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses"&gt;&lt;u&gt;best mattress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for your sleeping position, body size, and personal requirements. Beyond that, there are many other elements worth prioritizing to support deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating a cool, dark, and quiet bedroom can help you get deeper, higher-quality sleep,” says Dr Dasgupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthy purchases to create this ideal kind of sleep environment include blackout shades, breathable bedding, fans, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/how-does-white-noise-help-you-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/how-does-white-noise-help-you-sleep"&gt;&lt;u&gt;white noise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; machines or apps.&lt;/p&gt;

Garber, the president of Harvard University, praised Dr. Greenfield as “a towering figure in health care research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“His influence extended more widely than even he could have known, through the Medical Outcomes Study and so much else,” Dr. Garber said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In 1991, Dr. Greenfield and collaborators including his wife, Dr. Sherrie Kaplan, found that too many conversations about care are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/13/health/all-too-often-the-doctor-isn-t-listening-studies-show.html" title=""&gt;dominated by doctors&lt;/a&gt;.

But as temperatures rise, staying hydrated becomes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/daylight-saving-time-is-about-to-take-away-an-hour-of-your-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;more important&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;While guidelines like the "8 by 8" rule or drinking half your body weight in ounces can provide a good starting point, how much water you actually need will depend on various factors. "The "8x8" rule can be a bit oversimplified for some, but it's also not necessarily dangerous," says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company. Instead of relying on strict formulas, it's best to incorporate your water intake into small, daily habits. To help you track and meet your hydration goals, we've broken down a few practical tips from an expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much water should you drink each day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton says various factors play a role in how much water one needs daily, including body size, medications, gender, physical activity, climate, health status and altitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us are also familiar with the old adage: Drink eight glasses of water at 8 ounces daily. The eight-by-eight rule guides us to drink 64 ounces (about 1.9 liters) of water each day. Many of us have blindly followed this advice for our entire lives, not knowing where it came from or why we need eight glasses of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/best-water-bottle/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Best Reusable Water Bottles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the eight-by-eight rule came out of a void, because there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;no scientific evidence to back it up&lt;/a&gt;. It's just another of those long-standing myths people believe because that's what everyone believes. Drinking 64 ounces of water daily isn't bad, but it could be too much or not enough for some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For some people, simple rules like these help them stay on track. If drinking eight 8oz glasses of water a day helps someone hit their hydration goals, then it's a fine starting point. But I wouldn't call it the gold standard", says Fitton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other guidelines exist, but there's still no true consensus. There's no formal recommendation for how much water people should drink daily, perhaps because everyone needs different amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An "adequate intake" of water for adult men and women does exist, but it can vary from person to person. This adequate intake includes water from non-water beverages, such as &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/chocolate-milk-vs-protein-shake-which-post-workout-beverage-is-best/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/best-sports-drinks-for-2020-for-weightlifting-running-and-more/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sports drinks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, tea and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084154" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;yes, even coffee&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes water from fruits, vegetables and other foods (think of how much water goes into a bowl of oats or soup). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;adequate intake&lt;/a&gt; is 15.5 cups (3.7 liters or 125 ounces) for average men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters or 91 ounces) for average women. How you choose to consume these 125 or 91 ounces of fluid is up to you. Although this is the closest figure we have to a recommended daily intake, even these numbers differ for each person based on their &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/super-common-health-conditions-can-make-a-heat-wave-more-dangerous-heres-how-to-prepare/" target="_self"&gt;health condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You might need more water if...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have an active job:&lt;/strong&gt; Those on the go all day (especially folks who work outdoors) may need more water than most people. The more you move, the more you sweat, and you should replace lost water (and electrolytes) through fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are working outside during a heat wave, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/userfiles/works/pdfs/2017-126.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; drinking 8 ounces (1 cup) of water every 15 to 20 minutes during work. Drinking water both before and after work can help prevent dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You exercise often: &lt;/strong&gt;If you don't have an active job but you do exercise a lot -- whether in the gym or through recreational activities -- you also need more water than most. Even if you don't realize it, you lose lots of fluids during physical activity (&lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/dehydration-in-winter-how-and-why-you-keep-losing-water/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;even in cold weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Up your water intake to account for activity (especially travel activity). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You live in a hot climate: &lt;/strong&gt;Hot weather means increased sweating and replacing the lost fluid is important. Dryness compounds fluid loss in hot weather -- people in desert climates may need more water than those in tropical climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're pregnant or breastfeeding: &lt;/strong&gt;Pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/how-much-water-should-a-pregnant-woman-drink#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/how-much-water-should-a-pregnant-woman-drink%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22need%20more%20water%22}" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;need more water&lt;/a&gt; to encourage improved circulation, increased calorie intake, and other physiological processes that support their baby's growth.

"The color of your urine is the best and most personalized, consistent and immediate way to measure hydration throughout the day. We want to look for light yellow pee, not fully clear (over-hydrated) but also not deep yellow or amber (under-hydrated)", says Fitton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a dry mouth, chapped lips or muscle cramps:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep, when you are dehydrated, your body will let you know. "Water is such a critical substance for life, so when we're lacking, our body will no longer work at its peak capacity, and this can persist in many ways, and uniquely from one person to another," Fitton explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for hydrating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different people follow different rules for hydrating. These four common guidelines can help you stay hydrated no matter your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink when you're thirsty:&lt;/strong&gt; There's some controversy surrounding this method. Some health professionals say you &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;shouldn't overcomplicate hydration&lt;/a&gt; and your body tells you when it needs water. Others say waiting until you're thirsty is &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/want-to-stay-hydrated-drink-before-youre-thirsty/art-20390077#:~:text=Thirst%20isn't%20a%20helpful,forgetfulness%2C%20to%20name%20a%20few." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;waiting too long&lt;/a&gt; -- that you're already dehydrated when you feel thirsty. Some people seem to have stronger thirst mechanisms than others, so this method may or may not work for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink a glass before meals and between meals: &lt;/strong&gt;This isn't bad advice. Structuring water intake around a ritual like mealtime can ingrain hydration as a habit. Your total water intake will vary depending on how many meals you eat. If you eat three meals, you'll drink five glasses of water according to this rule, which may not be enough (unless they're big glasses). This rule probably won't work for you if you don't have a routine eating pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink eight glasses daily: &lt;/strong&gt;Generic health advice rarely works for everyone. If you feel adequately hydrated on 64 ounces of water each day. If you feel overly hydrated (clear pee, very frequent urination or swelling), cut back slightly. If you feel dehydrated (dark pee, headaches, infrequent urination, lightheaded or fatigue), eight glasses may not be enough for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink half your body weight in ounces:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a simple guideline that's easy to remember and usually easy to achieve. If you weigh 150 pounds, aim to drink 75 ounces of water each day. This is the only rule of thumb that accounts for different body sizes, but it doesn't account for thirst, climate, activity level or other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make water visible and accessible: &lt;/strong&gt;Fitton explains that keeping your water accessible at all times provides a visual reminder to drink water. She also recommends using an app like &lt;a href="https://waterminder.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;WaterMinder&lt;/a&gt; that sends daily reminders to drink water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair your water intake with your daily habits:&lt;/strong&gt; Another great way to get your daily water intake is to make drinking water part of your daily habits. This can look like drinking water right when you wake up, after eating a meal or right before you leave the house. "These mini habits build on things you already do, so you're not trying to remember to do something new. The more you tie hydration into your daily routine, the easier it becomes," says Fitton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment with hydration techniques to find what works for you.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list takeaway-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories and can boost exercise performance by improving blood flow to muscles during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mice with enhanced brown fat lived 20% longer and showed 30% better exercise performance, with the benefits transferable through tissue transplantation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rutgers researchers are developing a drug that could activate brown fat in humans, potentially helping people maintain physical fitness as they age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. —&lt;/strong&gt; The next breakthrough in anti-aging medicine might come from a surprising source: fat. But not just any fat—brown fat, a special type that burns energy rather than storing it. Researchers at Rutgers University are developing a pill that could boost this beneficial tissue’s activity, after discovering its remarkable effects on exercise capacity and lifespan in mice. Their work suggests that activating brown fat could be the key to staying physically fit as we age, with a drug potentially available for testing within a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/206179/text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brown fat&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just for keeping us warm—it actively contributes to better exercise performance and potentially extends our healthy years. The paper, authored by Dorothy E. Vatner, Jie Zhang, and Stephen F. Vatner from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, offers a fresh perspective on fat tissue and its surprising connections to exercise capacity and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Exercise capacity diminishes as you get older, and to have a technique that could enhance exercise performance would be very beneficial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthful aging&lt;/a&gt;,” said Stephen Vatner, university professor and director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute in the medical school’s Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine and senior author of the study, in a statement. “This mouse model performs exercise better than their normal littermates.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-fat-is-created-equal"&gt;Not All Fat Is Created Equal&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people think of fat as something to lose, but brown fat, (also known as brown adipose tissue) &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brown-fat-protects-from-chronic-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;works differently&lt;/a&gt; from the white fat we typically try to shed. This special tissue burns calories rather than storing them, generating heat through a process called thermogenesis. While scientists have known about brown fat’s heat-producing abilities for decades, the connection between the tissue and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise performance&lt;/a&gt; represents a fascinating new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rutgers team has been studying a particular genetic model—mice lacking a protein called regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14)—that exhibit dramatically &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extended lifespans&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced exercise performance. Their research found that these long-lived mice have more potent brown fat, which appears to be directly responsible for their impressive physical abilities and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The color difference between white and brown fat isn’t just cosmetic. Brown fat cells contain numerous mitochondria—cellular power plants that give these cells their distinctive brown color. These mitochondria are packed with a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which allows them to generate heat instead of the usual cellular energy currency, ATP. This metabolic flexibility makes brown fat uniquely positioned to influence whole-body energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impressive-results-from-brown-fat-transplantation"&gt;Impressive Results From Brown Fat Transplantation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ most compelling evidence comes from transplantation experiments. When they transplanted brown fat from the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice into normal mice, the recipients experienced dramatically enhanced exercise performance within just three days. In contrast, normal mice receiving brown fat transplants from other normal mice also showed improvement—but only after eight weeks. This suggests that the brown fat from the long-lived mice possesses unique properties that can rapidly boost exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists say that the transplanted brown fat increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the legs during exercise, promoting better oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles. It also stimulated the formation of new blood vessels and increased the density of existing ones. In essence, the brown fat was helping to build a more efficient circulatory system for delivering fuel during physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice produced unusually high amounts of active brown fat and showed about 30% better exercise performance than normal mice, both in speed and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/muscles-exercise-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time to exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, several pathways appear to be activated by the enhanced brown fat, including SIRT3 (a longevity-associated protein), MEK/ERK signaling, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These pathways collectively improve mitochondrial function, reduce &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance blood flow—all critical factors for exercise performance and potentially for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-better-with-brown-fat"&gt;Aging Better With Brown Fat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection to aging becomes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-cup-of-coffee-activates-calorie-burning-brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;even more apparent&lt;/a&gt; when examining the physical appearance of the genetically modified mice. Normal mice show typical signs of aging—&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;graying fur,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hair-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, and general body atrophy—but the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice maintain a more youthful appearance well into old age. Even at advanced ages, they maintain a healthier appearance, avoiding the typical signs of aging that appear in normal elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modified mice live &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/flexibility-key-to-longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about 20% longer&lt;/a&gt; than normal mice, with females living longer than males – similar to the pattern seen in humans. While the paper doesn’t explore the gender difference in depth, it raises intriguing questions about sex hormones and their potential interaction with brown adipose tissue function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical applications extend far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-home-gyms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the gym&lt;/a&gt;. If brown fat truly has the protective effects suggested by this research, it could become a therapeutic target for preventing or treating a host of age-related conditions. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are all mentioned as potential conditions that might respond to brown fat-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With all the medical advances, aging and longevity have increased in humans, but unfortunately, healthful aging hasn’t,” Vatner said. “There are a lot of diseases associated with aging – obesity, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cancer – and what we have to do is find new drugs based on models of healthful aging.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-real-life"&gt;From Lab to Real Life&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than develop a treatment that addresses aging broadly, which poses regulatory challenges, Vatner said his team plans to test for specific benefits such as improved exercise capacity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This approach builds on their previous success in developing a drug based on a different mouse healthful longevity model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with some people to develop this agent, and hopefully, in another year or so, we’ll have a drug that we can test,” Vatner said. He added that most people would prefer to increase brown fat levels by taking pills rather than ice baths and is optimistic about translating the newest finding into an effective medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wondering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/off-switch-brown-fat-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how to activate&lt;/a&gt; their own brown fat now, current science suggests that cold exposure is one of the most effective natural stimulants. When we’re cold, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, which binds to receptors on brown fat cells and activates UCP1-mediated heat production. In the meantime, techniques such as deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat naturally. Studies have found such efforts to produce short-term benefits that range from enhanced immune system function to improved metabolic health, but Vatner said none of the studies have run long enough to find any effect on healthful aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the path from these mouse studies to human applications remains uncertain, but study authors are hopeful that a brown fat-activating drug is in reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically modified mouse lacking the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14 knockout mice), which they compared to normal mice. To determine if brown fat was responsible for the benefits they observed, the team performed transplantation experiments, surgically moving brown fat from RGS14 KO mice into normal mice, then testing the recipients’ exercise performance on specialized treadmills. They measured hind limb blood flow using imaging techniques and examined tissue samples for signs of new blood vessel formation. The team also analyzed molecular markers to identify the specific cellular pathways involved in the effects of brown fat on exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-and-limitations"&gt;Results and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice lived about 20% longer than normal mice and showed approximately 30% better exercise performance. When brown fat from these mice was transplanted into normal mice, the recipients experienced enhanced exercise capacity within just three days, compared to the eight weeks needed for normal mice receiving brown fat from other normal mice. The improved performance came with increased blood flow to the hind limbs and higher density of blood vessels in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. Mouse models don’t always translate directly to human physiology, and the transplantation approach isn’t directly applicable as a human intervention. The paper also notes inconsistent findings in the field regarding the effects of exercise on brown fat, suggesting complex relationships that may vary based on intensity, duration, and individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;

It produces butyrate, a sign of gut fermentation that suggests good digestion and nutrient absorption, Segata explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"It’s probably producing short-chain fatty acids, which are supposed to be positive modulators of immunity,” Segata adds. Still, he says that “strong data” is needed to learn more about what this actually does for your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;What he does know is that there’s a solid link between coffee consumption and the presence of &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;. Segata and fellow researchers actually fed coffee to  &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus &lt;/em&gt;that was growing in petri dishes and found it made the bacteria grow faster. “It’s clear that the coffee was stimulating it,” Segata says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This stimulation is possibly due to metabolites in the coffee. Plus, it's “probably not the caffeine, because decaf had a similar effect," Segata adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-get--l-asaccharolyticus-from-other-foods" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get  &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt; from other foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As of now, this bacterium is just linked to coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, aronia berries contain chlorogenic acid and polyphenols like coffee, so they may have a similar effect, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danbee Kim" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert, weight loss surgeon, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “Other foods high in chlorogenic acid—such as blueberries, apples, and pears—might also support the growth of this gut bacteria, though more research is needed to confirm this,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-coffee-do-i-need-to-drink-to-reap-the-gut-benefits" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much coffee do I need to drink to reap the gut benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Having a cup or two of coffee a day promotes the growth of &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;, Segata says. But he points out that “heavy” coffee drinkers, who have three or more coffees a day, have up to 10 times more of the bacteria in their gut compared to people who don’t drink coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-negative-impacts-of-coffee-on-gut-health" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any negative impacts of coffee on gut health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few to keep in mind. The biggest potential drawback is that it could raise your risk of acid reflux, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rudolph Bedford" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Rudolph Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“It also increases gastrointestinal mobility and can potentially cause diarrhea,” he says. But, overall, Bedford says that coffee is considered a relatively safe drink for people, provided they don’t overdo it on the caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

They urged New Yorkers not to feed their pets raw food or raw milk and to avoid letting them roam outside where they could encounter wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk that bird flu presents to New Yorkers remains low, the health department said. Human-to-human transmission of the avian influenza virus remains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt; and has not occurred during the current outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is possible for someone to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Other%20animals%20infected%20with%20avian,or%20mouth%2C%20or%20is%20inhaled." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;contract bird&lt;/a&gt; flu from an animal if they come into contact with the animal’s organs, blood or other bodily fluids, including milk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2022, 70 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and one has died, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov.

            Three months into 2025, the United States has surpassed the total number of measles cases in the country for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3f2s000d3b6muukucs34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far in 2025, there have been at least 308 measles cases reported in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, there were 285 measles cases. The high numbers are driven by a large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000i3b6m47ifgdpy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the years since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 measles cases reported each year. There have been an average of about 8 outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But the worst outbreaks each year typically stay under 50 cases. 2025 is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year that an outbreak has led to more than 200 cases. The others were the Disneyland outbreak that started in 2014 and 2019 when a nearly year-long outbreak in New York came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death – a school-aged child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico said last week they are investigating the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles. The Lea County resident had not sought out health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
