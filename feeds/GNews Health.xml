"This suggests that older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Seniors are more vulnerable to overdoses, as many live with chronic health conditions, take several medications and process drugs more slowly, the researchers said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers could not determine the underlying reasons for these overdoses, as the analysis was a cross-sectional study on patterns over time, Pasia noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths — not due to fentanyl alone — and the importance of sharing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug misuse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drug misuse&lt;/a&gt; prevention strategies to older patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors advised anesthesiologists and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain medicine&lt;/a&gt; specialists to recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, and to be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults over 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, added that older adults prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should be informed about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Doctors are encouraged to be cautious when prescribing opioids to senior patients.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk can also be reduced by simplifying medication routines, and using clear labeling and safe storage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt; methods when appropriate," Wang said in the press release. "Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Larissa K. Laskowski, an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emergency medicine&lt;/a&gt; physician and medical toxicologist at NYU Langone Health, told Fox News Digital that the findings of this study are "not surprising," since illicit-made fentanyl is "one of the deadliest substances known to man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In recent years, it has proliferated throughout the illegal drug market," said Laskowski, who was not involved in the study. "Fentanyl is regularly found in supplies of cocaine and methamphetamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laskowski, an educator in fentanyl risk at schools, stressed that everyone, not just seniors, should be aware of the drug's potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a small amount (the equivalent of a few grains of salt) can stop breathing and cause overdose death," she warned. "Any substance that is sold illegally (not from a dispensary, pharmacy or licensed retail store) could have anything in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no quality control.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding waist size to BMI raises U.S. obesity rates from 42.9% to 68.6%, according to a major JAMA Network Open study.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One in four adults have “hidden” belly-fat obesity despite a normal BMI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Older adults and Asian participants saw the biggest increase in obesity classification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The new definition could change who qualifies for treatment and reshape healthcare policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; A revolutionary change in how doctors define obesity could fundamentally reshape medical practice, according to research analyzing health data from over 300,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that adopting a new obesity framework endorsed by 76 professional medical organizations increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity rates&lt;/a&gt; from 42.9% to 68.6% among study participants. This dramatic jump stems from including people who have dangerous &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-belly-fat-prostate-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; despite maintaining what doctors previously considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-025-01542-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed data from the All of Us research program and represents the first large-scale examination of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-redefined-why-doctors-are-ditching-bmi-for-these-key-health-markers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new obesity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; would affect healthcare. The research tracked participants for four years to document real health outcomes, not just theoretical classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-scale-why-waist-size-matters"&gt;Beyond the Scale: Why Waist Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;height-to-weight calculation&lt;/a&gt; that has dominated medicine for decades, the new approach incorporates waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio alongside BMI to create a more complete health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by endocrinologist Dr. Lindsay Fourman from Massachusetts General Hospital, found that traditional BMI measurements miss many people with dangerous fat distribution patterns. The research team found that belly fat, regardless of overall weight, serves as a key predictor of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercising-belly-fat-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists identified a category called “anthropometric-only obesity” affecting 78,047 study participants. These individuals maintain normal BMI scores while carrying elevated measurements around their midsection. Among this group, 17,426 people (22.3%) had BMI scores doctors previously labeled as normal or underweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;BMI measurements don’t tell the whole story for some people who have higher levels of dangerous belly fat.(kwanchai.c/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-that-bmi-misses"&gt;Health Risks That BMI Misses&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked participants to document who developed serious health problems. People with this hidden form of obesity faced significantly higher risks than those without obesity, despite looking healthy on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared to people without obesity, those with the waist-centered type were 76% more likely to have organ problems. They also faced more than double the risk of developing diabetes and 55% higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;he research team found that people with this form of obesity often developed &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, physical limitations, and sleep apnea. These conditions typically emerge gradually, making early identification through waist measurements potentially valuable for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-age-and-demographics-drive-changes"&gt;Age and Demographics Drive Changes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed striking patterns across different groups. Among participants aged 18 to 29, obesity prevalence under the new definition reached 43.9%. The most dramatic change occurred among seniors: 78.3% of Americans over 70 in the study met criteria for obesity under the new framework, compared to previous BMI-based classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This age-related increase reflects how body composition changes over time, with fat increasingly accumulating &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/bigger-belly-weaker-memory-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around the midsection&lt;/a&gt; as people get older. Among people over 70 in the study, 54.4% had what researchers called “clinical obesity” indicating the presence of organ dysfunction or physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also found notable differences by race and gender. Asian participants saw the largest relative increase in obesity rates, jumping 90.3% from 2,439 participants (27.0%) to 4,641 participants (51.4%) under the new definition. Male participants were more likely than female participants to have anthropometric-only obesity, affecting 32.5% of men versus 21.7% of women in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obesity-treatment-guidelines-face-major-overhaul"&gt;Obesity Treatment Guidelines Face Major Overhaul&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new framework could dramatically alter who receives obesity medications and treatments. Currently, 44.7% of study participants qualified for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ozempic-anti-obesity-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; based on BMI guidelines. Under the new framework, about half of those who currently qualify for weight-loss medication (51.2%) would be reclassified as having preclinical obesity or no obesity, suggesting they may receive lower priority for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, among participants with clinical obesity under the new definition (excluding those with diabetes already eligible for certain medications), 15,495 of 69,894 (22.2%) wouldn’t meet current eligibility criteria for recent weight-loss drug trials or FDA-approved medications. This mismatch indicates treatment guidelines may need substantial revision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Lancet Commission that developed the new definition recommends pharmacological treatment for all people with clinical obesity and select individuals with preclinical obesity. This represents a shift from current practice toward more targeted treatment based on health complications rather than BMI alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-vs-preclinical-obesity"&gt;Clinical vs. Preclinical Obesity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach introduces two categories. “Clinical obesity” means someone has health problems or physical limitations related to their weight. “Preclinical obesity” means early warning signs are present but serious symptoms haven’t developed yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 36% of all study participants had clinical obesity, with rates climbing sharply with age. The distinction matters because people with clinical obesity faced the highest risks of future diabetes, heart disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the earlier stage carried meaningful health risks. People with preclinical obesity had more than three times the risk of developing diabetes and 40% higher risk of heart problems compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study tracked the most common health problems associated with clinical obesity: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; topped the list, followed by physical limitations and sleep apnea. The research revealed that organ dysfunction itself, even without obesity, significantly increased health risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For healthcare systems and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/when-health-insurance-makes-medicine-more-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, these changes could carry massive financial consequences. Medicare and other payers may need to reassess coverage policies as the eligible population for obesity treatments potentially shifts substantially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding,” Dr. Fourman said in a statement. “With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledge that implementing the new definition would require more work and resources than current BMI-based screening. However, they argue that the improved ability to identify health risks may justify the additional effort, particularly if integrated into electronic health record systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity prevalence&lt;/a&gt; using traditional BMI-based criteria (42.9%) closely aligns with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates for the US population (40.3%), supporting the potential broader applicability of these findings to American adults generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 301,026 adults in the All of Us research program, enrolled between May 2017 and September 2023. Participants underwent standardized measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference, and completed health surveys. The study used electronic health records to track health outcomes over a median follow-up period of 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the new obesity definition, 68.6% of participants met criteria for obesity compared to 42.9% using traditional BMI-based criteria. The increase was driven by including 78,047 people with “anthropometric-only obesity” who had elevated waist measurements despite normal BMI. Clinical obesity affected 36.1% of all participants. People with anthropometric-only obesity had odds ratios of 1.76 for organ dysfunction and adjusted hazard ratios of 2.12 for diabetes and 1.55 for cardiovascular events compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on diagnostic codes, surveys, and laboratory results to classify clinical obesity, which may not fully capture all cases of organ dysfunction. Researchers could not establish whether organ dysfunction was directly caused by obesity. The analysis used the new framework’s ability to predict future health risks as a measure of clinical utility, rather than a gold standard comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

Conditions such as gastritis, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or long-term antibiotic use can block this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged antibiotic use also disrupts gut bacteria that help produce certain B vitamins.

&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, with 1.3 million people living with the condition, according to &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/zimbabwe" title="External link — figures"&gt;figures&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from UNAIDS, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/united-nations-un/t-17440154"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; program on &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-aids/t-18932088"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern African nation recently met the UNAIDS 95–95-95 fast-track targets, meaning that 95% of those living with HIV know their status; 95% of those who know they have HIV are on life-saving antiretroviral treatment; and 95% of people on treatment achieve viral suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-teams="true"&gt;Ponesai Nyika, a public health expert with extensive experience in HIV/AIDS research and program implementation, told DW that Zimbabwe has a "very solid HIV response infrastructure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of lenacapavir is expected to greatly boost Zimbabwe's efforts to eradicate infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is lenacapavir considered a game changer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; has hailed lenacapavir as a &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" title="External link — transformative step forward"&gt;transformative step forward&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in protecting people at risk of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNAIDS has also described the drug as a watershed moment in HIV response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about it as a potential &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/miracle-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-approved-amid-drastic-us-health-budget-cuts/a-73023089"&gt;miracle drug&lt;/a&gt;," Angeli Achrekar, deputy director of UNAIDS, told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the fact that it is nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections is remarkable, it's unprecedented. It's the best thing we've got in the HIV response. We do not have a vaccine or cure, but this is extraordinary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is expected to be rolled out across 120 low- and middle-income countries by 2027 and is anticipated to significantly reduce the 1.3 million new HIV/AIDS infections yearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika told DW that the drug is seen to be "highly effective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Specifically for HIV prevention, it has been seen to be highly effective, which is what makes it very exciting compared to the others. It is highly effective in preventing HIV infections if used correctly and consistently," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug has gone through two trials: One in sub-Saharan Africa among women and girls, the other among American &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lgbtq-rights/t-17455109"&gt;gay and bisexual men and transgender women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both trials, the efficacy of the drug was more than 99%, raising hope for its "extraordinary" abilities in HIV prevention once fully available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika further explained that the administration of the drug only twice a year makes it even more effective as it reduces incidents of low adherence to HIV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mixed reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Zimbabweans are upbeat about the introduction of the medication, others are more skeptical about the drug's cost, safety and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nyika argues that while lenacapavir — like every new medication — can have some side effects, "the data that we have does show that lenacapavir is very safe and well tolerated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He urged African countries rolling out the drug to be transparent and communicate clearly about any side effects of the drug to aid in its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant praise for the drug, its cost also raises key questions about how accessible this "miracle drug" can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How is it going to help us? Because I'm sure it's for the rich," a Ugandan citizen told DW, reacting to the $40-dollar yearly cost of the drug, which was initially projected to cost about $28,000 (€24,197) per person annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lenacapavir prevention regimen also requires an initial oral dose when starting the regimen: two tablets to be taken on the day of the first injection and two tablets to be taken on the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address cost concerns, Nyika suggested negotiations by middle- and low-income countries and possible local or regional production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These can help bring the cost down, but also leveraging the existing supply chain, community health system and different service delivery modules will help ensure equitable access," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership with PEPFAR and the Global Fund is expected to significantly reduce the pricing of the "miracle drug."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana are also among those countries selected for the rollout by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

My mind was in a spin,” she said, calling the diagnosis “a big shock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brinklow received some positive news — the cancer hadn’t spread beyond her right breast — she still needed to undergo a double mastectomy as her cancer was&lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-diagnosed-with-two-types-of-breast-cancer-in-one-breast-shares-her-story-8714706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:positive for estrogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; positive for estrogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that means it’s less aggressive, as the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/er-positive-breast-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains, “There’s a risk of recurrence after treatment, including treatment for early-stage, low-risk ER-positive breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow was back on her feet as soon as possible: “Following surgery I was out walking for miles every day. You could say I walked myself better.” Her motivation, she said, was her music, as she explained, “When you play the bagpipes you really do need to be able to raise your arms up above your head … lots of women don’t get their full mobility back [after surgery].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Brinklow / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Julie Brinklow in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery is “a very slow process,” Brinklow says, adding that she’s “still improving all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I am back to doing everything that I used to do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow hopes her story can warn others that breast cancer comes in all shapes and sizes. As she explained, “I probably wouldn’t have done anything about it if I hadn’t been nagged. A tumor doesn’t have to be a small hard lump, it can be something that just feels like a thickness that you haven’t noticed before, like part of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t delay in getting checked out if you think there is something different or that you haven’t noticed before,” she said. “The thing that sticks in my mind is that I wasn’t worried about it, and I should have been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Brinklow for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/musician-thought-she-strained-herself-playing-the-bagpipes-11826967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 06:08:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBpaU90TEVfdXlJWFgtZWdZN0IxZmtucEdUUkI0TE1MSk1rekpsRnZTU0I3SzVGMnZxZ1R5R3VUQjdaU1lWcW9VR3VfUEg5TlVsX19LRjFNbm4zcFhJNnMyN2pLMWJTbzFiS2NRdUZDQThQNzN4</guid></item><item><title>使用这位培训师的简单日常挑战- Fit&amp;Well ，只需五分钟即可提高平衡感</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/it-only-takes-two-minutes-to-boost-your-balance-with-this-trainers-simple-daily-challenge</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound"&gt;Ultrasound is generated&lt;/a&gt; with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.26.2.179"&gt;heat up and destroy&lt;/a&gt; brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain, and even  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Frontal brain MRI" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red.

For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/17/r206"&gt;eventually overcame this problem&lt;/a&gt; by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/indication-development-pipeline/"&gt;Hundreds of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found notable success on a condition called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1600159"&gt;essential tremor&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/diseases-and-conditions/essential-tremor/"&gt;performed routinely at many locations&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delivering drugs to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier-and-how-can-we-overcome-it-75454"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is evolution's exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2202001804"&gt;temporarily open the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061230"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4011"&gt;brain metastases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2022.114583"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/boyer-lectures-gene-therapy-is-still-in-its-infancy-but-the-future-looks-promising-104558"&gt;Gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay1344"&gt;facilitate the delivery of gene therapies&lt;/a&gt; to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulating immune responses against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/anti-cancer-car-t-therapy-reengineers-t-cells-to-kill-tumors-and-researchers-are-expanding-the-limited-types-of-cancer-it-can-target-196471"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; instructs the patient's own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma – have tumors that are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01979-x"&gt;immunologically "cold,"&lt;/a&gt; meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92089"&gt;better recognize and destroy cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-ultrasound-helmet-reaches-deep-inside-the-brain-without-surgery"&gt;New Ultrasound Helmet Reaches Deep Inside The Brain Without Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world's first &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/uva-focused-ultrasound-cancer-immunotherapy-center/"&gt;focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, my colleagues are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472661"&gt;running a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-cancer-cells-can-become-immortal-research-finds-a-mutated-gene-that-helps-melanoma-defeat-the-normal-limits-on-repeated-replication-194234"&gt;advanced melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/SVIN.123.001140"&gt;cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM&lt;/a&gt;. CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0439"&gt;debilitating neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113861"&gt;improve drug delivery to CCMs&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01390-z"&gt;stop CCMs from growing&lt;/a&gt; in mice, even without administering a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don't yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/25424823251343789"&gt;abundant research on the safety&lt;/a&gt; of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262622/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Despite being so easy and accessible, walking is often underrated. You don’t need fancy gear, a gym membership, or a strict routine, just comfy shoes and a bit of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s always a bit of confusion about when to walk, before meals, right after, or later in the day?

"For people with diabetes or prediabetes, this habit can significantly lower post-meal glucose and even reduce HbA1c over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He discourages walking immediately after meals. "Walking immediately after finishing a meal (within 0–5 min) is still beneficial, but some people may feel discomfort or bloating, especially after a heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's the right time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start 10–15 minutes after eating," says the doctor. "This timing coincides with the period when blood glucose levels begin to rise as the meal is being digested and glucose is entering the bloodstream," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"10–20 minutes of light to moderate walking (at 3–4 km/hour pace) is usually enough to blunt the glucose spike. A longer 30-minute walk can provide additional benefits, especially after carbohydrate-rich meals," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But, wait, are you walking the right way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest exercises, but surprisingly, a few common mistakes can really sabotage its benefits. First off, walking too slowly or without purpose won’t get your heart rate up enough to boost fitness or burn calories. It’s okay to stroll, but adding a bit of pace or some arm movement makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, ignoring posture can cause neck, back, or shoulder strain — stand tall, engage your core, and swing your arms naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is skipping consistency; walking once in a while won’t do much, so make it a regular habit, even if it’s just 15 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong footwear is a sneaky culprit too — shoes that don’t support your feet can lead to pain or injuries, which kills motivation. Also, walking on the same route all the time can get boring and reduce effort; mix it up with different paths, trails, or slight inclines to challenge your body. Finally, forgetting hydration or ignoring body signals can make walking uncomfortable or even risky, especially in hot weather. Walking is amazing, but doing it smartly is what really delivers results!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，这种常见的早晨习惯无声地损害动脉；可使心脏死亡风险增加87 ％ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/this-common-morning-habit-is-silently-damaging-arteries-can-increase-heart-death-risk-by-87-says-study/articleshow/124619416.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we start our mornings has a lot to do with how the rest of the day is going to go. From picking up mobile phones after waking up, to struggling to get that one cup of coffee, all morning rituals matter. At first, these might seem harmless but medical professionals are now concerned about how morning habits contribute to clogged arteries, which harm our cardiovascular health. One of the habits, as research points out, is skipping breakfast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the breakfast meal has been hailed as vital. But with busy lives, increasing numbers of people are skipping breakfast altogether or consuming things on the go, (which is also pretty harmful) ,pushing back the morning meal in the guise of intermittent fasting, weight management, or time pressures. Research now indicates this practice is potentially much worse than it looks, especially for cardiovascular and arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How it influences the health of arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arteries transport oxygen-carrying blood from the heart to all cells throughout the body. Over time, it may become constricted because of the buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis. When this occurs gradually and silently, it raises the threat of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping breakfast also sets off a sequence of physiological events that can hasten the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that individuals who usually skip breakfast are likely to have higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol, increased blood pressure, and increased insulin resistance. All these three factors combined raise the risk of arterial plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body is starved of nutrients in the morning, it compensates by releasing stress hormones such as cortisol. This surge of hormones raises inflammation, which is central to the hardening of arteries. Furthermore, individuals who eat breakfast skip meals later in the day, gobbling high-calorie or processed foods that increase triglyceride levels and put pressure on the vascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109717393178" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;tudy looked at how breakfast habits relate to the early stages of artery disease.

A different study conducted in Spain revealed individuals who routinely skipped breakfast had thicker walls in their carotid arteries, a primary indicator of nascent atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe this connection is not just about what one eats, but WHEN one eats. The body follows a circadian rhythm, and eating in alignment with that rhythm helps regulate metabolism and blood sugar levels. Skipping breakfast disrupts this rhythm, forcing the body into a stress state that promotes fat storage and inflammation — both harmful to arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why symptoms often go unnoticed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most troubling aspect of this condition is that it advances stealthily. Atherosclerosis becomes established over a long period of years, and frequently decades, with no apparent symptoms until a dramatic event occurs. Preliminary symptoms such as minor fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath are usually attributed to normal fatigue. When the individual develops chest pain or heart attack, the disease is well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests, lipid profile testing, and imaging scans such as carotid ultrasound are the only dependable methods to diagnose changes within arteries early. Physicians also stress the need to monitor blood sugar and blood pressure levels since both are highly correlated with vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to keep your arteries healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution starts with returning balance to the morning routine. Having a healthy breakfast regulates metabolism and enhances steady energy levels. Nutritionists suggest incorporating foods high in fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats — like oats, nuts, seeds, fruits, and whole grains. These reduce LDL cholesterol and guard the inner wall of blood vessels. In all this, hydration is equally important, water helps in flushing out toxins from the body, and regulates all processes of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is steering clear of processed breakfast foods filled with added sugars or trans fats. These are likely to trigger a blood sugar spike and inspire inflammation, which negates the whole idea of an early morning meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This silent damage caused by skipping breakfast, reminds us that heart health is fragile, and depends on what we do, how we do, and what we eat. As much as it is important watch our weight, it is equally important to set the tone for the day and not neglect any meal, especially breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/4-everyday-drinks-that-can-help-prevent-artery-plaque-and-improve-blood-flow/articleshow/124518536.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read: 4 everyday drinks that can help prevent artery plaque, and improve blood flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgJBVV95cUxOS0ZMd1ZfQmtjZ0VjS3E3YjRvZ1JzbEh5ZGM5QmlvQVRmMGJRSXdOODBLX29FZ1BiZ3h3SEZ0WGdaVU5JUVdOOHZjajNGSFIxM2UxNkp3OTFwRm01RUNjMFEtQl9fMWlXU25BWW5pajFNenRFV0h0cFU1S2NkMUN0NUZ0TkwtWmNUbGswQ3UzSVpsUzRieENGeHZmaVVGLXdabFplMUtYUTI5WHdkSk4wVGFIU1ZoeF9OY3hFRlZYbXdlMVVKRzJiaFpRNVRUUVVrNWtDTXpTU05NZnhFbkNKbGlnZGFzUk9IWTVxelpqR09HNlJGalc1OE9zclNpZWNTcjdYSVdZb0lRRkxDNGp1WW5Ta1UxSy1fMWc</guid></item><item><title>两名前麦克莱恩临床医生正在用一种新模式--《波士顿环球报》来应对儿童强迫症</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/17/lifestyle/mclean-clinicians-childhood-ocd/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

If your kid is afraid to go to school, terrified of germs, or trapped in a world constrained by fear, it can feel like eternity. Trust me; I remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A child’s brain is a sponge. What OCD does, what anxiety does, is it robs a child of the chance to really experience the world on their own terms. We want to help them change their relationship with the OCD. We’re not going to make it go away; we’re going to help the child, parents, school, everybody, respond to these emotions in a different way that’s more productive,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My experience mirrors the typical trajectory. About 1 in 5 cases begins by age 10, with upticks around puberty and young adulthood. OCD isn’t caused by parenting, Potter says. It reflects a sensitive brain alarm system, partly genetic, shaped by environmental and developmental changes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Genetics contributes 40 to 50 percent of the risk of OCD; the genetic contribution appears to be higher in childhood-onset than in adult-onset disease,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And while awareness has grown, treatment delays are still common: Many kids still go years before an accurate diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“With early recognition and evidence-based care, OCD is highly treatable,” Potter says. In honor of all those kids who used to struggle in silence — and those who still do — here’s what to know about OCD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD is: &lt;/b&gt;OCD is diagnosed when intrusive thoughts, images, or urges cause anxiety. As a result, the sufferer feels compelled to perform actions or mental rituals to get relief, so much so that it disrupts life, Potter says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Obsessions are persistent, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause distress (like my fixation on ear lumps). Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental rituals to reduce distress or prevent something bad from happening. They can be behavioral and visible — like hand-washing or checking — or invisible, like counting or praying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sometimes, compulsions are related to a fear (like checking a stove to make sure you turned it off so the house doesn’t burn down); other times, they aren’t logical (walking on a certain side of the road to keep your parents safe). Most of all, these obsessions or compulsions consume time, often more than an hour per day. They’re exhausting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, saddest of all, many kids “know behaviors are hurting their lives or are distressed by them, but they still feel unable to stop. Shame is common and delays asking for help,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are lots of OCD strains: fear of contamination; needing things to be perfectly symmetrical; relationship doubts with checking and reassurance; and existential worries, such as rumination about death or mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD isn’t:&lt;/b&gt; Lots of people have daily rituals, like tapping a can of Diet Coke before opening it or lighting a candle when walking into a room. The difference? These behaviors are grounding, and they’re optional. If you can’t do them for some reason — let’s say you’re out of matches — you can move on. With OCD, functioning stalls until the behavior is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s exhausting, not because the person wants to think this way, but because the OCD is directing them. It’s like having mental pop-up ads. Our minds usually click them away quickly and without much thought, but in OCD, the pop-ups stick around and start taking over, and even if you do what they say and click them away, they come back,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it’s treated&lt;/b&gt;: The good news is, OCD is highly treatable. The gold standard is exposure and response prevention. This is a specialized form of cognitive behavioral therapy that re-trains the brain’s alarm system by facing triggers (or exposures) and by resisting the corresponding ritual (response prevention).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s an example: For a long time, I avoided walking up flights of stairs, because it would make my heart race, which I’d then obsess over. My heart was definitely about to explode. So my therapist made me walk up and down several flights, creating the very symptoms I avoided — and realize that, no, my heart wasn’t going to collapse. With ERP, Potter says, more than 70 percent of kids improve significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Medication also helps. It won’t erase the OCD; instead, think of it as a way to turn down the noise and reduce symptom intensity, making therapy more fruitful. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the most commonly prescribed medications for OCD. I take Prozac.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What parents can do&lt;/b&gt;: For support, Potter recommends resources including the International OCD Foundation and Anxiety and Depression Association of America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You can also try to separate your child from the OCD by externalizing it: “This is OCD talking, not you.” Some kids find it helpful to give it a name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve had kids give it the funniest names. They’ll call it Broccoli. My favorite was Miggy, after amygdala, our limbic fear system,” Potter says. “The idea is externalizing the OCD. OCD is trying to tell you what to do and trying to say that, if you don’t do this, then your day is going to be bad or a bad outcome is going to happen. But this is OCD: You don’t always need to listen to OCD.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Notice, name, and respond deliberately. “When OCD tries to run the show, pause before problem-solving or directing. Lead with empathy: notice and name what your child is feeling, reflect it with your words and body language, and then gently pivot to action by coaching one tiny step toward what they’re avoiding,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most of all, don’t accommodate the OCD. This might seem counterintuitive: You don’t want your kid to be upset; neither do their teachers or friends. But accommodation can backfire in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Parents often buffer distress by answering reassurance questions, assisting in avoidance behaviors, or creating work-arounds. It helps in the moment but grows OCD over time because it takes away the opportunity for kids to learn that, yes, they can really handle a challenging situation,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are ‘nice’ by trying to reduce distress in the moment, but the ‘kind’ thing to do is to show kids we believe in them and know they can handle it. There’s a concept in schools [that] moved from helicopter parenting to lawnmower parenting, where the urge is to clear the path for our kids. But that deprives them of the chance to build muscles and see that they can handle and get through the muck.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As psychologists Alex Jordan and Ben Levett &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt; in the Globe: “Anxiety feeds on avoidance,” they wrote. “When students take on what they’d rather avoid, they learn that worst-case scenarios rarely materialize, that discomfort is survivable, and that anxiety diminishes with practice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finally, praise their efforts. When your kid takes a step away from an OCD behavior and tolerates uncertainty, name it out loud: “You felt the urge and still chose bravery,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How a kid can explain OCD to their friends&lt;/b&gt;: I wished I’d had a way to explain what was going on in my brain when I was younger. My mind felt like a CD that kept skipping. People couldn’t really relate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s what Potter suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Younger kids could say, “Sometimes my brain gets stuck on worries. It tells me I have to check or repeat things to feel safe. I’m learning how to ignore those false alarms so my brain can calm down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Teens could say, “I have OCD, so my brain sends false alarms. I feel like I have to do things a certain way to calm down. I’m practicing not doing the rituals so I can retrain my brain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you’re dealing with friends or family who just don’t quite get it? Try this: “Everyone gets random thoughts. Mine sometimes get stuck and feel important even when they aren’t. I’m learning to face them without rituals so I can get my freedom back.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And for anyone currently struggling? Take it from me: You really can get your freedom back, and you will.

    &lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are everywhere – lined up on pharmacy shelves and promoted on wellness blogs and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dra_says/video/7399633468839185696?lang=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a friend or family member who swears a daily tablet will help everything, from better sleep to alleviating muscle cramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you really need one? Or it is just marketing hype?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is magnesium and why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential metal the body needs to make and operate more than 300 different enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:%7E:text=consumer%20fact%20sheet.-,Introduction,L%20%5B1%2C5%5D."&gt;enzymes&lt;/a&gt; build protein, and regulate muscle and nerve function, help in the release of energy from our food, and help to maintain blood function. The body doesn’t produce magnesium so we need to get it from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/magnesium"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily magnesium dose of 310–420 mg  a day for adults and 30–410 mg  for children, depending on age and sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easily met through a good diet. Foods &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/foods-high-in-magnesium"&gt;rich in magnesium&lt;/a&gt; include nuts and seeds, whole grains, seafood, meat, legumes and green leafy vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even get some of your magnesium needs met through &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170271/nutrients"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. It has 146 mg per 100 g of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I know if I’m deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;at risk of experiencing magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include people with restricted diets, gastrointestinal problems such as Crohn’s and coeliac diseases, type 2 diabetes, and alcohol dependence. Older adults are also more likely to be deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will only need a magnesium supplement if you &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/magnesium-deficiency"&gt;show signs of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most common signs is muscle spasms and twitches. Other symptoms to look out for include low appetite, nausea and vomiting, or your heart beating abnormally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium deficiency can be properly diagnosed by a blood test ordered by your doctor. If you need this test, it’s covered by &lt;a href="https://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/search.cfm?q=magnesium&amp;amp;sopt=S"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What conditions can it help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium supplements have been promoted to prevent muscle cramps, manage insomnia and help with migraines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While magnesium deficiency is linked to &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;muscle cramps&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of most muscle cramps is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;unknown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the current evidence does not demonstrate that magnesium supplements can prevent muscle cramps in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Magnesium supplements come in different brands and doses.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Nial Wheate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is conflicting data as to whether the use of magnesium helps with sleep. One study reported magnesium was able to reduce the time for a person to fall asleep by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-024-04721-w"&gt;17.4 minutes&lt;/a&gt; while others didn’t &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.59317"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139319"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-024-07794-0"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent research suggests taking 122-600 mg of magnesium supplements daily for 4–24 weeks may decrease their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are magnesium supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are generally well tolerated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, abdominal cramping and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;diarrhoea&lt;/a&gt;. Magnesium causes diarrhoea by drawing water into the intestine and stimulating movement in the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to take too much magnesium and you can &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/magnesium-overdose-whats-the-likelihood"&gt;overdose&lt;/a&gt; on it. Very large doses, around &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323349#likelihood-of-an-overdose"&gt;5,000 mg per day&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to magnesium toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the research investigating the clinical use of magnesium focuses on magnesium in &lt;a href="https://www.nmi.health/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NMJ_Magnesium_A-Review-of-Clinical-Use-and-Efficacy.pdf"&gt;oral&lt;/a&gt; formulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other formulations are available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As magnesium is a small metal ion, it can &lt;a href="https://www.jle.com/fr/revues/mrh/e-docs/permeation_of_topically_applied_magnesium_ions_through_human_skin_is_facilitated_by_hair_follicles_307878/article.phtml"&gt;pass through skin&lt;/a&gt; – but not easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium bath salts, patches and topical cream-based formulations may be able to raise your blood magnesium levels to some extent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But due to the amount needed each day, tablets and foods are a better source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to watch out for when taking magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium products can vary widely in dose, formulation and cost. Magnesium supplements have between 150 to 350 mg of the metal per tablet. Your required dose will depend on your age and sex, and whether you have any underlying health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements sometimes contain other vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins C and D, and the metals calcium, chromium and manganese. So it’s important to consider the total quantities if you’re taking other vitamins and supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many magnesium supplements also include vitamin B6. While this vitamin is important for supporting the immune system, high intakes can it can cause serious &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/too-much-vitamin-b6-can-be-toxic-3-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-260400"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re already taking a B6 supplement, a magnesium supplement that also includes it can put you at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1940661205221154954"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What if you’re considering supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you might be deficient in magnesium, speak to your doctor who can order a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suffer from migraines, cramps, or poor sleep, talk to your doctor or pharmacist who can advise on and monitor the underlying cause. It may be that a change in lifestyle or an alternative treatment may be more appropriate for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to take a magnesium supplement, check you won’t be taking too much of any other vitamin or mineral. A pharmacist can help select a supplement that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Beyond building muscles or burning calories, regular movement can physically reshape the brain and sharpen memory. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO),&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; over 1 in 4 adults globally are not active enough, leading not only to physical but also mental decline. And that’s where neuroscientists like Dr Wendy Suzuki, a leading brain researcher at New York University, bring clarity: exercise isn’t just good for the body, it literally changes the brain’s structure and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science of the “sweaty brain”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wendy Suzuki’s research, as shared on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMvNqW2RE2d/?igsh=MWJyb2tpcGF3cWtjaA%3D%3D" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Diary Of A CEO podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reveals something remarkable: every drop of sweat strengthens the brain. In her lab studies, even participants who moved their bodies for 45 minutes, two to three times a week, showed measurable improvements in memory, mood, and focus. This happens because exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the hippocampus, the region responsible for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, consistent workouts make the hippocampus stronger and thicker, almost like growing “mental muscles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means clearer thinking, faster recall, and a sharper sense of focus in everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The minimum dose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those not used to exercise, Suzuki’s team discovered a very hopeful number: two to three 45-minute aerobic sessions a week. That’s enough to begin changing how the brain functions. These sessions can include cycling, brisk walking, swimming, or dancing, anything that raises the heart rate and keeps it there steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks, participants reported better memory retention and a noticeable lift in mood. The beauty of this discovery is that the brain responds to movement much faster than expected, it doesn’t need months to notice improvement; even a few weeks can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The brain’s sweet spot&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While two or three sessions are a great start, Suzuki’s second study revealed something even more exciting. Among regular exercisers, the more they moved, the greater the brain benefit. Those who increased activity up to six or seven days a week experienced continuous improvements in hippocampal growth, prefrontal function (decision-making and planning), and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this means around 4-5 total hours of aerobic exercise per week is an ideal target for sharper memory and stronger cognitive control. That could be 45 minutes daily for five days, or longer, lighter walks mixed with occasional intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why aerobic workouts rewire the brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic workouts stand out because they flood the brain with oxygen and trigger the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a kind of “fertilizer” for brain cells. BDNF helps neurons grow stronger and connect better, improving learning and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also lowers the levels of stress hormones like cortisol, which can otherwise shrink brain regions responsible for memory. In other words, every jog, spin class, or dance session helps the brain defend itself against ageing and stress while staying alert and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mood-memory connection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Suzuki’s most heartwarming findings is how mood improvement precedes cognitive gains. When exercise lifts emotional state, by releasing endorphins and serotonin, the brain becomes more ready to absorb and store information. Happiness, it turns out, sharpens focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might explain why many people find their most creative or clearest thoughts appear after a workout. The emotional uplift primes the brain to remember and problem-solve better, creating a powerful loop of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every drop of sweat counts, literally&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most comforting insight from Suzuki’s research is that there’s no wasted effort. Even short bursts of physical activity, climbing stairs, dancing while cooking, or a brisk 15-minute walk, contribute to brain growth.

			&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen is a household name – the go-to remedy for everything from headaches to period pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent research suggests this everyday drug might be doing more than easing discomfort. It could also have anti- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="177986" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists uncover more about the links between inflammation and cancer, ibuprofen's role is coming under the spotlight – raising intriguing questions about how something so familiar might offer unexpected protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-blocks-multiple-tumors-in-mice-for-250-days"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Blocks Multiple Tumors in Mice For 250 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) family. The connection between NSAIDs and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-prevention-37896"&gt;cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt; isn't new: as far back as 1983, clinical evidence linked sulindac – an older prescription NSAID similar to ibuprofen – to a reduced incidence of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/colon-cancer-4369"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in certain patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, researchers have been investigating whether these drugs could help prevent or slow other cancers too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177990" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642.jpg" alt="A Common Pain Relief Drug May Have Anti-Cancer Properties" class="size-full wp-image-177990" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177990" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ibuprofen is a form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relief.

There are two main types. COX-1 helps protect the stomach lining, maintains kidney function, and plays a role in blood clotting. COX-2, on the other hand, drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit both, which is why doctors recommend taking them with food rather than on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen and endometrial cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;A 2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that ibuprofen may lower the risk of endometrial cancer, the most common type of womb cancer, which starts in the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) and mainly affects women after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest preventable &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/womb-cancer/risks-causes"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for endometrial cancer is being overweight or obese, since excess body fat increases levels of oestrogen – a hormone that can stimulate cancer cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include older age, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; (particularly oestrogen-only HRT),  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177986" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Early onset of menstruation, late menopause, or not having children also increases risk. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/womb-cancer/symptoms/"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study&lt;/a&gt;, data from more than 42,000 women aged 55–74 was analysed over 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who reported taking at least 30 ibuprofen tablets per month had a 25% lower risk of developing endometrial cancer than those taking fewer than four tablets monthly. The protective effect appeared strongest among women with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, aspirin – another common NSAID – did not show the same association with reduced risk in this or &lt;a href="https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(17)31448-8/abstract"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;. That said, aspirin may help &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;prevent bowel cancer from returning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other NSAIDs, such as naproxen, have been studied for preventing &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/2/11/951/47850/Chemopreventive-Efficacy-of-Naproxen-and-Nitric"&gt;colon, bladder, and breast cancers&lt;/a&gt;. The effectiveness of these drugs seems to depend on cancer type, genetics, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen's broader potential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen's possible cancer-protective effects extend beyond endometrial cancer. Studies suggest it may also reduce risk of bowel, breast, lung, and prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people who &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6188"&gt;previously had bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; and took ibuprofen were less likely to experience recurrence. It has also been shown to &lt;a href="https://mbrc.shirazu.ac.ir/article_6973.html"&gt;inhibit colon cancer growth and survival&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2017.1239"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; even suggests a protective effect against lung cancer in smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177993" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642.jpg" alt="illustration of bowel cancer location" class="wp-image-177993 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177993" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bowel cancer was found to return less in people who took ibuprofen. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3xXkB9k/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and ibuprofen is, at its core, anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By blocking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047847714002433?via%3Dihub"&gt;COX-2 enzyme activity&lt;/a&gt;, the drug reduces production of prostaglandins, chemical messengers that drive inflammation and cell growth – including &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/6/1487"&gt;cancer cell growth&lt;/a&gt;. Lower prostaglandin levels may slow or stop tumour development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's only part of the story. Ibuprofen also appears to influence cancer-related genes such as &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323635"&gt;HIF-1α, NFκB, and STAT3&lt;/a&gt;, which help tumour cells survive in low-oxygen conditions and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen seems to reduce the activity of these genes, making cancer cells more vulnerable. It can also alter how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-020-0906-7"&gt;DNA is packaged within cells&lt;/a&gt;, potentially making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A word of caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all research points in the same direction. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.35363"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 7,751 patients found that taking aspirin after an endometrial cancer diagnosis was linked to higher mortality, particularly among those who had used aspirin before diagnosis. Other NSAIDs also appeared to increase cancer-related death risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)10411-7?uuid=uuid%3A36697d88-ee94-4d3c-8754-db42e17bde1b"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; found that NSAIDs, especially aspirin, may reduce the risk of several cancers – though regular use of other NSAIDs could raise the risk of kidney cancer. These conflicting results show how complex the interaction between inflammation, immunity, and cancer really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise, experts warn against self-medicating with ibuprofen for cancer prevention. Long-term or high-dose NSAID use can cause serious &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nsaids-prescribing-issues/management/nsaids-prescribing-issues/#:%7E:text=Cardiovascular%20and%20renal%20complications%20are,cardiac%20or%20renal%20adverse%20events."&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach ulcers, gut bleeding, and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less commonly, they may trigger &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5422108/"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart attacks or strokes. NSAIDs also interact with several medications, including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-199630060-00002"&gt;warfarin&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/18/7/1062"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the risk of bleeding and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-medicine-may-stop-colorectal-cancer-from-returning"&gt;A Common Medicine May Stop Colorectal Cancer From Returning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that a humble painkiller could help prevent cancer is both exciting and provocative. If future studies confirm these findings, ibuprofen might one day form part of a broader strategy for reducing cancer risk, especially in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, experts agree it's wiser to focus on lifestyle-based prevention: eating anti-inflammatory foods, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine/patient/endometrial-prevention-pdq#:%7E:text=of%20endometrial%20cancer.-,The%20following%20protective%20factors%20decrease%20the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer,the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer."&gt;maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday medicines may yet hold surprising promise, but until the science is settled, the safest prescription for cancer prevention remains the oldest one: eat well, move often, and listen to your doctor before reaching for the pill bottle.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266645/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

According to one new study, the so-called "dopamine detox" trend doesn't have a whole lot of merit. And not only that, but it's come to overshadow a handful of other practices that not only manage dopamine better, but have longer-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 activities that will actually give you a better 'dopamine detox' than avoiding screens:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dopamine Detox" has become a hot online trend for overcoming the ills of screen addiction, all with a deceptively simple premise: Taking breaks from screens or even just "raw-dogging" flights with no screens of any kind can "detox" your brain from dopamine, the neurotransmitter that governs pleasure, reward, and motivatio,n and which is heavily involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems reasonable enough, right? You avoid the thing you're addicted to, the addictive mechanism is cut off, and you're "detoxed" from its effects. But the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-dopamine-detox-and-do-i-need-one-254813" rel="nofollow"&gt;science so far &lt;/a&gt;says there's really not much of anything to this. (Note: This research pertains to adults. Kids are a whole other ball of wax when it comes to the impacts of screens!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, dopamine is a necessary neurotransmitter we actually need to function, not some poison that needs shedding. But the idea of "detoxing" from dopamine is alluring, especially because when people try it, they do usually notice changes, especially negative ones like craving the very screens they've just given up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mechanism is very real. But there's a major distinction missing from all this viral discourse: Scientists say it's not so much that we're getting MORE dopamine that is the problem, but rather that we're getting dopamine hits so OFTEN and so QUICKLY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It basically overwhelms the system, which is why scientists say replacing "fast dopamine" with one (or all) of these four "slow dopamine" activities will not only help ease screentime overstimulation but also yield lasting, more complete results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/toyoake-japanese-city-limits-screen-time-2-hours-day"&gt;Welcome To Toyoake, A Japanese City Where Screen Time Is Limited To 2 Hours A Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-exercise.png" alt="woman hiking" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens exercise" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Alena Ozerova | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, not everyone's idea of a fun hobby. But it can be as simple as just going for a regular walk. No need to become an Olympic powerlifter. But physical exercise not only helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978/" rel="nofollow"&gt;boost and manage dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, but also levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, too, much like antidepressants do. The difference, again, is that it does so in natural doses in a natural rhythm rather than the bombardment that doomscrolling provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Creative projects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-exercise-creative.png" alt="man painting a picture" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens creative" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Mehmet Turgut Kirkgoz | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's painting, gardening, knitting, or bonsai trimming, creative projects and dopamine have a beneficial push-pull relationship. Creative projects provide &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4718590/" rel="nofollow"&gt;pleasure that releases dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, and creativity is enhanced by that release. So not only will sitting down to draw make your brain feel better, but your drawing will, in turn, improve, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Face-to-face interaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-face-to-face.png" alt="book club discussion" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens face to face" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;ferrantraite | Getty Images Signature | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be all "touch grass" about it, but go touch grass. Science has long known that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889690/" rel="nofollow"&gt;face-to-face interactions &lt;/a&gt;tell the brain to release dopamine, giving us all kinds of positive benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much like with creative projects, it has a knock-on effect. It makes us want to go out and interact even more. If you're the introverted, socially anxious type, gritting your teeth and stepping outside your comfort zone that first time just might be the key to coming out of your shell long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/test-reveals-screen-time-out-of-control"&gt;This Simple 3-Step Test Reveals If Your Screen Time Has Gotten A Little Out Of Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

			&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; progresses, harmful protein clumps build up in the brain, blocking communications between neurons and killing them off – but what if we could prevent these clusters from forming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from the University of Bath in the UK have achieved just that in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;basic worm model&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. They engineered a peptide, a small amino acid chain, to essentially keep a protein called alpha-synuclein locked in its healthy shape. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"&gt;prevented the misfolding&lt;/a&gt; that leads to clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; checks several important boxes: it's durable, and it can survive inside cells without causing any toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's Disease Could Be Ignited by Burned-Out Brain Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Jody Mason, from the University of Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study follows on from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2023.101563"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers, which identified part of the alpha-synuclein protein that may stop it building to dangerous levels. This key part or fragment acts like a guide for the protein to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg" alt="Peptide and protein diagram" class="wp-image-176560 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-560x415.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-600x445.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team used a shortened peptide to make sure alpha-synuclein proteins behaved. (Meade et al., &lt;em&gt;JACS Au&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fragment was then cut down into the smallest possible size to form the new peptide tested here. The researchers also added extra stability to their peptide molecule, using chemical structures called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"&gt;lactam bridges&lt;/a&gt; to stop it from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the peptide created by the researchers can patrol cells and prevent misfolding without interfering with the normal, healthy job that alpha-synuclein is there for: regulating neurotransmitter signaling chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dopamine-doesnt-work-in-our-brains-quite-the-way-we-thought"&gt;such as dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of finding effective &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;treatments for Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and other diseases like it, is that it can be difficult to disentangle the causes of the condition from the consequences – are alpha-synuclein protein clumps appearing because of the effects of Parkinson's, for example, or helping to drive its progression?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the treatment outlined here seems preventative. It could eventually be used to stop proteins from building up in the brains of people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;at risk of developing Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, rather than breaking up existing protein clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Astronaut in space, with text overlay" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177074" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's a lot of progress to be made – including figuring out the best way to deliver these peptides into the body (which will be significantly more difficult for humans than it is with worms) – but the early signs from this research are positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also want to explore using similar techniques for related conditions, including Lewy body dementia and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which are characterized by dangerous protein clumps of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Julia Dudley, the head of research at  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which helped fund this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.5c00694"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The second, &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=5160&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, was in a Los Angeles County resident. Both patients had to be hospitalized but are now recovering at home, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the overall risk of ... exposure to the public remains low, we are taking this very seriously,” Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson said in a statement. “This underscores the importance of continued surveillance, early response and vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of mpox is different  from the one that spawned &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-07/mpx-cases-decline-los-angeles"&gt;a global outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, which is known as “Clade II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade I is potentially even more concerning, however, because it may cause more severe illness and spread more easily, “including through close personal contact,” such as massage or cuddling, in addition to sex, the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of cases of Clade I mpox, which may cause more severe illness than the more-common Clade II, is concerning,” L.A. County health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health said last year that Clade I has historically caused more severe illness than Clade II, but &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-036.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; that “recent infections from Clade I mpox may not be as clinically severe as in previous outbreaks, especially when cases have access to quality medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is primarily spread through close, intimate contact, such as through body fluids, sores, shared bedding or shared clothing, as well as kissing, coughing and sneezing, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell-tale symptoms “include rash or unusual sores that look like pimples or pus-filled blisters on the face, body and genitals, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches or swelling of lymph nodes,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. Other symptoms can include a sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who develops an unexplained rash or lesions should avoid sex and intimate contact and seek medical evaluation as soon as possible,” the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should get tested if they have symptoms, officials said. Those who have symptoms should also avoid sex or close contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade II mpox generally causes mild-to-moderate illness and has been circulating at low levels throughout the United States since 2022, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 118 cases of Clade II mpox reported to the L.A. County Department of Public Health so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this week, there had been a total of six &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of Clade I mpox in the U.S. — all among people who had recently traveled to areas where this type of mpox is circulating, namely central and eastern Africa. None of those cases was  linked to each other, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says there have been more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40,000 cases of Clade I mpox&lt;/a&gt; in central and eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the countries with confirmed cases, multiple modes of Clade I mpox transmission have been documented, including “contact with infected dead or live wild animals” and “household contact often involving crowded households,” in addition to sexual contact, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39e6c30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c88c932/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbbd947/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f574188/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2851685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Countries in central and eastern Africa that have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cdd6d31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d1ecbf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2fbbeb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff2fda8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;These countries in central and eastern Africa have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the general U.S. population in the U.S. from Clade I mpox is considered “low,” the CDC says. The agency classifies the risk to gay and bisexual men who have sex with more than one partner as “low to moderate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel-associated cases of Clade I mpox have also been found in a number of other regions globally, including Asia, Australia, Europe and South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Clade I mpox case in the U.S. was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/s1116-california-first-clade.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 11 months ago — in someone in California who had traveled to Africa and received care in San Mateo County, according to the CDC and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-036.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. That person had mild illness, the San Mateo County health department &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.smcgov.org/ceo/news/san-mateo-county-health-responds-new-mpox-strain" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected get better within two to four weeks, the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said, “but antiviral treatments may be considered for individuals with or at risk of developing severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-dose Jynneos &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is also available to help prevent the spread of mpox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who only got one dose can get their second doses “no matter how long it’s been since the first dose,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are widely available, and can be found at pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS. People can look up locations to get vaccinated through the vaccine’s manufacturer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fempoweredagainstmpox.com%2F%3Futm_content=%26utm_medium=email%26utm_name=%26utm_source=govdelivery%26utm_term=%23locator-map/1/01000199ee69436e-f5d64ed8-741e-4092-b7a9-57396cb267d8-000000/tA7ggaQrerUoABOTVMH8kqdw1N0C9Q35BAxTw78Y0eo=427" target="_blank"&gt;Bavarian Nordic&lt;/a&gt;.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first U.S. cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the public is low, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not the U.S. first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-outbreak-who-f1c5d501223ccf3b53c6d9a2727d5c8a"&gt;Mpox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-public-health-emergency-us-f336fc99abd57f0866a38b578d5bb44c"&gt;was averaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; close to 500 cases per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-health-medication-public-313a2781a28f6b17230843432a609118"&gt;later that year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mpox-health-world-health-organization-c39dea7fa56622eaab680bcb2ad7eeec"&gt;had waned enough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that it was no longer an international emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/doc/1432277049818/the-2025-protein-profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cargill&lt;/a&gt;. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals – they're all encouraging more protein after lifting," said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The protein boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, &lt;a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/us-proteins-and-protein-alternatives-market-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to Mintel&lt;/a&gt;, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights &lt;a href="https://www.innovamarketinsights.com/trends/protein-beverages-trends-global-market-overview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chains like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-protein-lattes-cold-foam-menu-september-29/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that "consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly," Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="https://rubyoaknutrition.com/about/christine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ruby Oak Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need," Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.&lt;/p&gt;

A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?EXTKEY=M5ANXO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary," Tieu said. "Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people — including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes — protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein is really needed in a diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein — this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to look for high quality sources," Ansari said. "So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong," she said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-protein foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis," Tieu suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some protein-rich foods include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meats, with options like chicken and turkey leaner than beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood, like tuna, salmon, shrimp and scallops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-media-health-trends-experts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs, or egg whites for less cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milk or soy milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tofu and tempeh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, lentils, chickpeas and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megan Meyer, a science communication consultant with a doctorate in nutritional immunology, said she aims to have both snacks and meals that include protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of my favorite protein-rich snacks include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, a handful of nuts, meat sticks and hard-boiled eggs," she said. "My go-to proteins for meals include lean meats like chicken breast, canned tuna, beans, lentils and tofu."&lt;/p&gt;

Her initial daily targets were 1,200 calories, at least 50 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/dietitian-tip-fiber-high-protein-diet-rcna214084" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and low levels of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d6be" class="body-graf"&gt;“He went over the foods I like, what I should take out and what I added back in eventually,” she says. At first, she stopped eating carbs like pasta and bread, then later she modified the way she added them back in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77c6cc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Part of my Italian culture is that pasta would be your main dish,” she says. “Instead of having pasta four or five times a week, I would have a small portion as a side dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8035c9" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of frying, she now grills, steams, broils or uses an air fryer. She switched to vegan butter. “There were a lot of little changes in my food and how I prepared it,” she says. “You don’t realize it, but with just one tablespoon of regular butter, you’re adding all these extra fats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-156fd8" class="body-graf"&gt;She eats smaller meals throughout the day to make sure her blood-sugar levels stay even. In a typical day, she might have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-837822" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;A protein shake with a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter, plus supplements — collagen, MCT oil, vitamin D, vitamin C, a multivitamin, a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/food/10-good-prebiotic-foods-add-your-grocery-list-today-t216012" target="_blank"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; and a&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/probiotic-foods-rcna30830" target="_blank"&gt; probiotic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-morning snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Almonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch: &lt;/strong&gt;Salad with tuna or another type of fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Yogurt or a piece of fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner: &lt;/strong&gt;Grilled chicken, steamed vegetables and another side.

And they told me there was a good chance I would have another stroke within six months, but that has never happened,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-76a11f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She connects with support, and builds her confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03e03d" class="body-graf"&gt;Szalay weighs herself every week, on Saturday mornings: “I had a huge group text with family, friends and colleagues. That support system was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-saved-al-rokers-life-5-mindset-motivation-tips-rcna186157" target="_blank"&gt;key to motivating me&lt;/a&gt;. Every week I would get on the scale and tell them what I lost and what I weighed. I would get claps and hearts, and that’s what kept me going. Everyone needs a support system. You can’t do it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96f767" class="body-graf"&gt;As she started to lose the weight, her confidence grew. “I still relied on that support system, but it started to transfer over to me. I felt like I could do this. I’m confident now that I can do this on my own,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e1661" class="body-graf"&gt;That confidence gave her a sense of purpose. “I wake up and say, ‘What can I accomplish today?' There are goals I strive for. Before, I was waking up, doing the same routine, going to school and teaching. Now I feel like I have a purpose,” she says.”I would like to be an inspiration to others as that one woman on the beach was an inspiration to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 19:35:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOZ0Zkd1dYSWR1b0E1Z1NEZF93WV9mcjZidUhla2M3NlM4SnZpZlFDWUg0d2R0QXdISEJVS01kRTI2VGh0NFZ5U1E2SE5VUFhoc2ZXRE9VeEdCQS1mc3Z2YXllclVfaTZvaTBHNG9uQlJzV1RXQzlpWnBPcndsVThWVndkZm9Qc050akUyWWR4dXdSakhrczdROGt0SXVYRmJyM2JTWFBHVmJoZHZsWTVGdlZzQlZub1dwbVFn0gFUQVVfeXFMT3ExUDNRMURsU240dDQ0ME1mTFhHb1RrU09rQko3ZkJzc19HLXNRMzZha1hncExkN01xYXo4bzcwN2VvUHM3c1VDVU82NXQ3VW85R3hf</guid></item><item><title>缺失的蛋白质可能是恢复老化血细胞活力的关键- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-protein-key-rejuvenating-aging-blood.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our hair goes gray and our muscles weaken with age, our immune system also changes. In particular, the stem cells that become blood or immune cells can develop mutations, potentially leading to cancers or other dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have discovered an important cellular mechanism that drives this aging: the lack of a protein called platelet factor 4, whose levels decrease with age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024027432" target="_blank"&gt;they report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Blood&lt;/i&gt;. What's more, adding this protein to old blood cells reversed these signs of aging, which points to a promising therapeutic target for preventing or improving age-related disorders in the blood and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hematopoietic stem cells, also known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, are a special type of cell that live in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; and can develop into the ever-important blood and immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hematopoietic stem cells are very rare," said UIC's Sandra Pinho, associate professor of pharmacology and regenerative medicine in the College of Medicine. "We call them the Holy Grail of the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a young body, hematopoietic stem cells can easily generate both major groups of blood cells: myeloid cells, which include some immune cells, as well as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/red+blood+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;red blood cells&lt;/a&gt; that transport oxygen; and lymphoid cells, which include the T and B cells that protect us from infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the body ages, the hematopoietic stem cells are more inclined to become myeloid cells and make fewer and fewer lymphoid cells. This, in turn, changes how aging people's immune systems act.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"That's one of the reasons why, normally, older individuals are not used as donors for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow+transplantation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow transplantation&lt;/a&gt;, because their stem cells are not as potent," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice and in human bone marrow samples, Pinho and her colleagues discovered that platelet factor 4 is heavily involved in this aging process. In young mice and people, platelet factor 4 acts as a messenger, telling hematopoietic stem cells, especially the ones that generate myeloid cells, to stop multiplying and preventing them from proliferating out of control. With age, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; produce less platelet factor 4, allowing them to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When stem cells start to divide more often than they should, and if their proliferation is not regulated, they can accumulate mutations over time," said Pinho. In humans, these mutations can lead to inflammation, increase the risk of blood cancers, and even contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But incredibly, the scientists found that supplying platelet factor 4 to older mice undid signs of aging in their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hematopoietic+stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hematopoietic stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. They gave the animals a blood infusion of platelet factor 4 every day for over a month and found that their immune and blood cells appeared and acted much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same was true when the researchers added the protein to older human &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; in experiments in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It rejuvenated the aging of the blood system," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the effect was strong, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/platelet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;platelet&lt;/a&gt; factor 4 won't be a silver bullet that reverses the aging of all tissues and prolongs the lifespan of elderly human patients alone, Pinho said. But it could be a component of other rejuvenation methods to positively affect age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's clear evidence that it's possible to reverse, intrinsically, certain age-associated disorders," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprinted with Permission from &lt;a href="https://www.worldatlarge.news/2025/10/16/well-exercised-mice-passed-natural-fitness-to-their-male-offspring-but-not-through-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World at Large&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there were a way that didn’t involve CRISPR to give your offspring a natural talent for athletics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s totally possible as it turns out, because scientists just demonstrated it in mice, and it didn’t even involve so-called “good genes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involved a modern and exciting field of genetic biology called epigenetics: a term that refers to adaptations to genetic expression in response to life stressors. Here, the actual nature of the DNA doesn’t change, but adaptations packaged in the similarly important RNA made their way into sperm cells, the embryo, and the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this fascinating innovation begins in Nanjing University, where lead investigator on the study Xin Yin used to notice during his time as an undergraduate that the children of athletes seemed to possess a natural talent for sports. The reproductive biologist didn’t really see the sense in it; certainly, genes coding for larger lung volume would increase a child’s ability to run, but what could explain having a ‘knack’ for what takes months and years of training to master? There’s no gene that codes for having a knack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This curiosity led Yin to launch a research project with a fellow reproductive biologist at Nanjing to see whether a male mouse’s mastery of treadmill running could somehow imprint onto his offspring. Together with his co-authors, Yin subjected male mice to treadmill work everyday for 2 weeks before breeding them with female mice who did not exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125003882?__cf_chl_tk=c9kzXKQan2ZWc25o1TcSWXzB3pZpaNuh5vWUUE9PO90-1760620819-1.0.1.1-AGlOF8TRukCrycqrwbGjDW3zJDLMWW0AOlYzUgfqVzE#sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;they found&lt;/a&gt; was remarkable. The mice thusly born possessed more oxidative muscle fibers, could run for longer on treadmills, and were more resistant to weight gain from a high-fat diet, than the offspring of sedentary male and female mice. During the study period, Yin and his team sequenced the microRNA snippets in the sperm cells and the fertilized egg, and after observing the significant athletic adaptations, went back to see what might be causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise boosts the levels of a protein called PGC-1 alpha in muscle cells, where it activates genes that build more mitochondria, the organelles responsible for cellular energy and metabolism. PGC-1A is suppressed by another protein called NCoR1. In the exercised mice, sperm-bound microRNAs which proliferate under conditions of exercise target, once inside the mouse embryo, NCoR1. In effect, these RNAs released a natural, cellular brake on the development of metabolic power and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A true breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To triple check whether or not classic genetic transfer was behind this adaptation for countering NCoR1, the researchers looked through 10 of the microRNAs that seemed most likely confer the exercise benefits, selected one in particular, and injected it into embryos fertilized by untrained fathers. Just that action alone, a single, non-DNA molecule, was enough to reproduce the endurance benefits seen in trained fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/well-exercised-male-mice-appear-pass-fitness-their-male-offspring?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=alert&amp;amp;utm_campaign=DailyLatestNews&amp;amp;et_rid=545277073&amp;amp;et_cid=5754571"&gt;commenting&lt;/a&gt; on the study to &lt;em&gt;Science Magazine &lt;/em&gt;said they were “surprised” that a single RNA could have such an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, and to investigate whether similar effects were at work in humans, the team collected sperm from 8 men who trained regularly and 24 others who didn’t. An examination revealed that the equivalents of 7 of the 10 miRNAs seen in the mouse model were elevated in the sperm of trained men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first study to show that RNA can pass down the benefits of exercise, commented Colin Conine, an epigeneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the work but who called it “really a novel paradigm”. It probably suggests that the lifestyle choices of fathers need to be looked at with more scrutiny than in the past, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveats included that the endurance/exercise benefit was only seen in male offspring, suggesting the sperm microRNAs only make it through the paternal germline. Grandchildren never received the benefit their parents did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yin’s study couldn’t go so far as to investigate the mechanism behind the transfer: why and how did exercise affect sperm? How did the microRNAs pass through the blood-testes barrier? How did they reach the epididymis, the tubes where sperm cells mature? They had time and data to present two hypotheses: that exercise codes for the creation of small-extracellular vesicles which themselves have the capacity to bring microRNA through the testes-blood barrier, or that within the blanket hormonal response of exercise, steroids and thyroid hormones may alter microRNA expression in sperm directly, without relying on the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are now extremely curious to know what other effects microRNAs packaged in sperm cells are having on the father’s offspring. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WaL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using a genome-wide epigenetic analysis, scientists identified four key methylation sites—ATE1, SERPINB9P1, CHST11, and FOXP1—linked to maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in FOXP1 were especially important, correlating with reduced gray matter in brain regions tied to emotion and memory. These findings highlight how early trauma imprints itself on both biology and behavior, paving the way for early detection and trauma-informed care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Four DNA methylation sites were identified as biological markers of child maltreatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOXP1’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypermethylation of FOXP1 was associated with brain changes in regions involved in emotional and social processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; A methylation risk score (MRS) successfully distinguished individuals with a history of maltreatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child maltreatment, which includes abuse and neglect, is one of the most serious public health concerns worldwide. These adversities leave a lasting impact on the emotional well-being, memory, and social development of affected individuals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, reaches far beyond its psychological impact, affecting the brain and biological processes through genetic changes, which have remained unclear until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113417"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the researchers identified four different sites, the site FOXP1 was particularly significant as it acts as a “master switch” for the genes involved in brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Senior Asst. Professor Shota Nishitani and Professor Akemi Tomoda from the Research Center for Child Mental Development at University of Fukui, Japan, in collaboration with Professor Masataka Nagao from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan, reveals that child maltreatment leaves measurable biological “scars” on children’s DNA, leading to long-term alterations in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study were published in Molecular Psychiatry on September 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research builds on earlier findings from Prof. Tomoda’s group, which had revealed that child maltreatment can alter DNA. Unlike previous studies that focused on specific candidate genes, this current work employed a broader genome-wide approach, revealing novel molecular markers and directly linking them to brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the researchers conducted a detailed analysis of the epigenome (a set of chemical “switches” on our DNA that regulate gene activity) across three different groups to identify biological markers linked to childhood maltreatment as trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants included those in judicial autopsy cases, as well as toddlers and adolescents who had undergone protective interventions, with the adolescents also undergoing brain MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified four DNA methylation sites that were consistently associated with child maltreatment, namely ATE1, SERPINB9P1, CHST11, and FOXP1,” explains lead author, Senior Asst. Professor Nishitani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation sites are key players in genetic regulation, as they can regulate the gene expressions without changing the underlying DNA sequence. While the researchers identified four different sites, the site &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was particularly significant as it acts as a “master switch” for the genes involved in brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that hypermethylation of &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was linked to changes in gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus of the brain regions which are responsible for emotional regulation, memory retrieval, and social cognition. This highlights the biological link between early trauma, brain development, and later mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood trauma is not only a painful psychological experience but also leaves lasting biological marks at the molecular and brain levels,” explains Prof. Tomoda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying these epigenetic markers, we hope to develop new tools that can enable the detection and support of at-risk children as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use their discovery for predictive analysis, the researchers created a methylation risk score (MRS) using the four identified DNA methylation sites. The score could successfully distinguish individuals with and without a history of maltreatment using external data independent of their own, suggesting its potential as an objective screening tool for identifying childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this discovery extends to multiple fields, including healthcare, forensic medicine, and public health policies. In healthcare, these biomarkers could help improve early diagnosis and personalized trauma-informed treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in forensics, it could help support investigations and support child welfare. Furthermore, the screening tools may also drive preventive care, reducing the long-term societal impact of maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these implications, the study also reflects the mission of the Division of Developmental Support Research at the University of Fukui, which integrates neuroscience, clinical practice, and community-based approaches to promote resilience and well-being for children and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of child development and mental health, and focuses on early detection, intervention, and prevention of developmental and mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood should be a time of safety and growth,” emphasizes Prof. Tomoda. “Understanding how childhood trauma affects us biologically can lead to better strategies for prevention, treatment, and support, helping break the cycle of maltreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636820772"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does child maltreatment affect the brain biologically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It causes changes in DNA methylation, especially in genes like FOXP1, which influence brain development and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636838686"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Which brain regions are most affected by these genetic changes associated with child abuse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus—areas linked to emotion, memory, and social cognition—show measurable gray matter alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636855518"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this discovery important for mental health and child welfare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It provides biological evidence of trauma’s long-term effects and could lead to new diagnostic tools for early intervention and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics, neurodevelopment, and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a79796165626527614a6b6e247f276c7f617f63246b6924607a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yuuka Kawamoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-fukui.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yuuka Kawamoto – University of Fukui&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03236-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multi-epigenome-wide analyses and meta-analysis of child maltreatment in judicial autopsies and intervened children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt;” by Masataka Nagao et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-epigenome-wide analyses and meta-analysis of child maltreatment in judicial autopsies and intervened children and adolescents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child maltreatment (CM) is associated with adverse physical, psychological, and neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have been proposed as potential mechanisms underlying these long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify robust CM-associated methylation signatures, we conducted epigenome-wide analyses across three independent cohorts: judicial autopsy cases (CM:11, Controls:7), toddlers shortly after social intervention (CM:36, Controls:49), and adolescents who underwent brain MRI (CM:61, Controls:62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each cohort was analyzed separately, followed by a meta-analysis to identify common methylation sites associated with CM exposure. The meta-analysis identified four significant CpG sites located within the &lt;em&gt;ATE1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SERPINB9P1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CHST11&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these, methylation of &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was consistently associated with structural brain alterations, including increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFrC) and middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (MPCG), and decreased GMV in the occipital fusiform gyrus (OFuG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain regions are implicated in emotional regulation, memory retrieval, and social cognition, suggesting a potential neurobiological mechanism linking CM to later psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, methylation risk scores (MRS) derived from these four CpGs successfully discriminated individuals who experienced early-life adversity in an independent validation dataset, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.672, highlighting their potential utility as biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed enrichment of cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission pathways, supporting their involvement in traumatic memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying CM and identify potential biomarkers for early detection, prevention, and therapeutic intervention, ultimately contributing to breaking the intergenerational cycle of maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 17:59:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1KMWlEbzROblB4VF9UckdHT2tPV2ctNGYyelpLbi1kWk9ieDBhYURLandaSXlvT3E2NFBtSFpjMWhjeld4SG0xdmRuWm9yaTBqMGFwdlNneDZPZUoxUUw3UFYzcElRSzk4ZUFCTktaUEJpeVE</guid></item><item><title>根据新的定义，现在有数量惊人的美国人被认为是肥胖的- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/a-staggering-number-of-americans-are-now-considered-obese-under-new-definition-2000673086</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered, even briefly, whether you have obesity, you might want to double-check right about now. New research suggests that over two-thirds of Americans are considered obese under criteria released this year—well above the obesity rate based on the older standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Mass General Brigham examined health records from a large, diverse sample of Americans. They found that nearly 70% of people met the new criteria for obesity, which takes into account other measurements besides body mass index. Those only classified as obese under this new definition still had a higher overall risk of health problems than nonobese people, suggesting the expanded criteria can help doctors better catch these issues before they worsen, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the new obesity definition effectively stratified individuals at high-risk of organ dysfunction and long-term complications,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840138"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond BMI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a large group of obesity experts around the world backed by the Lancet &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/say-bye-to-just-bmi-experts-call-for-a-major-shift-in-how-we-measure-obesity-2000549992"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; for a dramatic change in how doctors diagnose the condition. It was the culmination of a long-running movement by some doctors and patients to think beyond BMI. Their newly devised criteria, &lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213858724003164"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in a report that same month, was endorsed by many health- and obesity-related organizations, including the American Heart Association in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;BMI is calculated using a person’s weight and height. And traditionally, obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 and over. The updated definition doesn’t entirely abandon BMI but rather calls for doctors to use other bodily measurements, either alongside BMI or in place of it. These other measurements are waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and the DEXA scan (a test that directly measures a person’s bone density and body fat).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The criteria authors argued that their new definition makes it easier for doctors to determine when someone has excess body fat, one of the main reasons why obesity can negatively affect health. They also stated their criteria can better capture cases of clinical obesity—obesity especially likely to be harmful and raise the risk of other serious health problems—than the old BMI-only system. But the researchers say theirs is the first study to comprehensively examine the implications of applying this criteria in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Hidden obesity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined data from the All of Us program, a long-running federal initiative to collect detailed health information from a diverse group of Americans. All told, they looked at the long-term health outcomes of over 300,000 American adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the old criteria, 42.9% of people in the sample were considered obese, a percentage in line with the national obesity rate &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm"&gt;tracked&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (a smidge over 40%). But under the new criteria, the percentage of obese people rose to 68.6%, including 36.1% who were considered clinically obese.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly all the people who met the old standard of obesity continued to be included under the new framework of using BMI plus another measurement. And just about all the extra new cases of obesity involved people who appeared to have “normal” BMI but had elevated levels of the other measurements. Importantly, people with less stereotypical obesity were still more likely to have organ dysfunction and a later risk of diabetes than people not classified as obese under the new definition. That said, people with classic obesity still seemed to have a higher risk of these health problems than people with obesity who had a normal BMI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that this new criteria isn’t excluding people who would have been diagnosed obese in the past—a finding supported by other &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bmi-is-actually-pretty-accurate-at-measuring-american-obesity-study-finds-2000594382"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it should help doctors identify people with hidden excess body fat and obesity, the researchers say. Ideally, this earlier detection can then help doctors prevent or better manage people’s obesity-related complications like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Identifying excess body fat is very important as we’re finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk,” said co-lead author Lindsay Fourman, an endocrinologist at MGB’s Department of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-adults-definition-obesity.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital. “Body composition matters—it’s not just pounds on a scale.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If widely adopted, this new system could pose some unique wrinkles of its own, though. The authors note that about a quarter of people with clinical obesity in the study wouldn’t be eligible for newer obesity medications like GLP-1 therapy, for instance. And while clinical trials have found that these drugs are substantially effective for people with classical obesity, it’s an open question as to how beneficial they would be for people who don’t fit the traditional standard of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Thus, implementation of the new framework may have significant ramifications for patients, including existing GLP1RA users, and creates a compelling need to evaluate use of antiobesity medications within this redefined target population,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But instead of truly decompressing, it’s easy to slip into habits that don’t actually restore our mental health—like doomscrolling, answering “just one more” email or zoning out in front of the TV. Experts say the hours after 5 p.m. are a key window to rebalance your body and mind, helping you &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manage stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;, regulate emotions and set the stage for better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Habits and mental health have a bidirectional relationship—our mental health influences the habits we engage in, while at the same time, the habits we engage in influence our mental health,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.transcendent-therapy.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lara Barbir, Psy.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lara Barbir, Psy.D&lt;/a&gt;. “When done consistently, lifestyle factors like exercise, quality sleep, stress management and nutrition all interact and affect each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, what’s the best way to support your mental health once you’ve clocked out for the day? Here are three science-backed habits that mental health experts recommend adding to your evening routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;1. Move Your Body to Transition out of “Work Mode”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After hours of sitting at a desk or rushing from one task to another, your body and mind need a signal that it’s time to shift gears. &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7886602/signs-youre-not-moving-enough-during-the-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physical movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Physical movement&lt;/a&gt; is one of the simplest and most effective ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I would particularly emphasize some form of movement because we are wired to move much more than we actually do in the modern day,” says Barbir. “It really benefits our mental health.” A 2025 review found that taking approximately 7,000 steps per day—even below the traditional 10,000-step goal—was associated with &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7822525/mental-benefits-of-exercise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improved markers of physical and mental well-being;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;improved markers of physical and mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Movement also triggers the release of the body’s natural mood boosters, called endorphins, and helps &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower stress hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;lower stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; like cortisol. Whether it’s a brisk 20-minute walk, a gentle yoga flow or stretching while listening to music, the key is to choose something enjoyable enough to look forward to each evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Barbir adds that this transition ritual helps shift you from “doing mode” to “being mode,” making it easier to relax and reconnect with yourself after a demanding day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Connect with Others (or Yourself)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Humans are social creatures, and feeling connected is essential for mental well-being. Yet after a long day, many people isolate themselves without realizing it. “We all have the need to feel a sense of belonging, so connecting with loved ones is a necessity that can also help us de-stress,” says Barbir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drleaf.com/about-dr-leaf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caroline Leaf, M.S., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Caroline Leaf, M.S., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, agrees that spending quality time with others is vital for emotional regulation and long-term resilience. “After leaving work, I personally love bonding with family through cooking meals, playing board games, watching movies and chatting about life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research helps explain why these connections are so meaningful. Loneliness is now recognized as a major public health concern and a strong predictor of early mortality and poor mental health. Experts believe loneliness acts as a chronic stressor, overactivating the body’s stress response system and raising cortisol, which can contribute to both mental and physical illness. Interestingly, positive social interactions can counter this stress response by releasing comforting chemicals like oxytocin, often called the “love” hormone. These interactions may include hugging, eye contact, laughter or a quality conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The good news? Even small, consistent efforts to connect—like a nightly phone call with a friend or sharing a walk with a neighbor—can help buffer against loneliness and lower stress hormones. Research also shows that practices encouraging &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937844/how-self-compassion-can-help-your-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:self-reflection and self-compassion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;self-reflection and self-compassion&lt;/a&gt;, such as journaling, can enhance mental resilience and emotional regulation, meaning that even when you’re physically alone, feelings of loneliness may be less intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Unwind Your Mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between deadlines, constant notifications and endless mental to-do lists, it’s no surprise that stress lingers long after the workday ends. That’s why creating space to intentionally calm the mind is essential for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Leaf suggests building in what she calls “thinker moments,” which are times when you switch off any external input and allow your thoughts to wander. “These moments give the brain time to rest and reboot, which is essential for both mental and physical health,” she says. Allowing your mind to drift during a quiet walk, shower or creative activity helps restore cognitive energy and strengthen problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Barbir also recommends incorporating reflective practices to release pent-up thoughts before bed. “Scheduled worry time is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention used for insomnia, and can help with anxiety and stress management,” she explains. “Over time, it can also &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve sleep quality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;improve sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;.” This might involve journaling your worries or jotting down tomorrow’s to-dos, then setting them aside to mentally close the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the final 30 to 60 minutes before bed, both experts recommend stepping away from goal-oriented or screen-heavy tasks. Try stretching, meditating, reading or enjoying a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7918599/drink-recipes-to-help-you-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soothing beverage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;soothing beverage&lt;/a&gt; as part of your nighttime routine. “Where your mind goes, your brain and body follow,” Leaf says. “So choose calm before bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Habits to Support Mental Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond the three evening essentials—movement, connection and unwinding—experts say other small steps can make a big difference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Technology Mindfully.&lt;/strong&gt; “Notice when you’re mindlessly picking up your phone to check social media, email or the news,” says Barbir. “Get curious about what's going on within you that’s beneath that habit and, instead, learn to slow down and be present with yourself so you can find peace within you rather than somewhere external.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Outside.&lt;/strong&gt; Exposure to &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-boost-energy-8425516" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural light;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;natural light&lt;/a&gt;—especially in the morning—helps regulate your body’s circadian rhythm, which supports better sleep, increased energy and improved mood throughout the day. Spending time in nature also lowers cortisol and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Quality Sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Restorative sleep is essential for emotional regulation, stress recovery and mental clarity. Aim for consistent sleep and wake times and create a relaxing pre-sleep routine to help your brain wind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Brain-Healthy Foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Focus on &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061785/anti-inflammatory-mediterranean-diet-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts and olive oil. These hallmarks of a Mediterranean-style diet are linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Professional Support. &lt;/strong&gt;If you often feel anxious, down or have trouble sleeping despite healthy routines, consider checking in with a qualified mental health professional. Working with a psychologist, therapist or health care provider can help support your mental health long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though your workday may end at 5 p.m., your mental health deserves care around the clock.
