            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 11-1 to delay a vote on changes to a newborn hepatitis B shot. It was a surprise twist after a lengthy discussion on the hepatitis B vaccine typically delivered to newborns shortly after birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a00093b6q58dg3aic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee had planned to consider a new recommendation that would wait to give newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until they are at least a month old. Currently, babies are given this shot at birth, usually before they leave the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000a3b6q1sejok4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in the United States since 1991. After it was implemented, hepatitis B infections in infants dropped from an average of 18,000 per year to around 20 reported cases of hepatitis B in babies per year now. Children infected with hepatitis B nearly always develop longterm infections which can damage the liver, increasing the risk for liver scarring, transplant and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000b3b6qti091qup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an abrupt and confusing end to Thursday’s meeting, vaccine advisers also cast new votes on Friday on the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine in the Vaccines for Children program. ACIP members voted Thursday to recommend against using the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for young children. The new vote on Friday brought the Vaccines for Children program in line with that new recommendation. Nine voted in favor and three members abstained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000c3b6q2xe34tqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advisory group’s recommendation isn’t final. HHS said in a statement Thursday that it “will examine all insurance coverage implications following today’s ACIP recommendation, prior to a final decision on adoption by the Acting Director.” Kennedy deputy Jim O’Neill is serving as acting CDC director after Dr. Susan Monarez was ousted abruptly as head of the agency last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000d3b6qezxtgvbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians and a non-voting ACIP liaison member, told the members on Friday he was concerned about the conflicting MMRV votes case on Thursday, which would have created different recommendations for people of lower socioeconomic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000e3b6qwsiiing4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It suggests, Goldman said, that the second vote “actually revealed the truth that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is that there is no associated harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfqut3mv00003b6qx9wsj3qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;This is a breaking news story and will be updated.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the West Coast Health Alliance &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/GETTINGIMMUNIZED/Documents/2025-26-Respiratory-Virus-Vaccine-Recommendations-2-pager.pdf"&gt;released its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinations during the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season. That alliance is a new partnership between California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/17/west-coast-states-issue-joint-vaccine-recommendations-ahead-of-cdc-advisers-meeting/"&gt; to develop parallel recommendations for patients&lt;/a&gt; — bucking the CDC under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a longtime skeptic of vaccines. Gov. Gavin Newsom, other blue state governors, medical associations and even some top Republicans nationally have expressed concern that the CDC would not root its recommendations in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the alliance’s guidance, those older than 6 months should get vaccinated for COVID-19. That sticks closely to the recommendations of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Washington, D.C. health insurance trade association AHIP announced that its scores of members nationally will continue to cover COVID-19 shots through 2026. The group’s members include Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente, California’s largest private health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and doctors had expressed concern that insurers would stop covering the cost of COVID-19 shots for many patients after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;limited eligibility&lt;/a&gt; to seniors and younger people with certain medical conditions. The out-of-pocket cost of a shot is reportedly upwards of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers typically incorporate the recommendations of the CDC. In May, Kennedy announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, and the CDC panel meeting this week is expected to make formal recommendations on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a statement, AHIP said it would rely on the CDC’s vaccine guidance as of September 1, 2025 — effectively ignoring any new recommendations produced by the CDC panel that was hand-picked by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent,” AHIP said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Kaiser in Northern California said it “is making the new COVID-19 vaccine available to all our members 6 months and older at no cost,” starting September 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kaiser Permanente’s administration of the COVID-19 vaccine is based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidance from our physician experts and many other sources, including leading medical societies,” the spokesperson said. “Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Zimmerman, a family physician at Temescal Creek Medicine, a small clinic in Oakland, applauded the insurers decision. He said lack of coverage would be a barrier for patients who want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination has proven effective at preventing serious cases, hospitalizations and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If somebody can theoretically get a vaccine, but it is the difference between them making a rent payment or not, that is de facto blocked access to care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said he’d been concerned about the potential out-of-pocket cost of a COVID-19 booster for his patients. He and other doctors at the clinic have written prescriptions for patients who might not fall into the FDA’s new categories for those eligible to get the shot, such as healthy people younger than 65. Like many in the Bay Area, he and his patients had &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/08/bay-area-sees-covid-19-wave-and-tremendous-confusion-about-vaccines__trashed/"&gt;been confused about the shifting rules and whether they qualified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It shows good faith, it aligns with what we know is best practices, and the science that we know,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based American Public Health Association. He said the insurers are following what he sees as “the best science and knowledge” — while the CDC does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC committee meeting this week is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. On Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/kennedy-advisory-panel-vaccine-vote/"&gt;panel voted to stop recommending a combined shot&lt;/a&gt; for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for children under 4 years old; studies have shown children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. Varicella is better known by the name chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel’s members delayed until Friday reviewing the guidance for vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B , which can &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/18/hepatitis-b-liver-cancer-bay-area/"&gt;cause serious liver infections and cancer.&lt;/a&gt; In 1991, the advisory committee recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel is also slated to turn its attention to recommendations for COVID-19 shots on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, demand for COVID-19 boosters was high this month during a late-summer surge of the virus, but &lt;a href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/diseases/covid"&gt;rates of hospitalizations and deaths are low.&lt;/a&gt; The virus continues to pose the most danger to seniors and younger people with other medical conditions that elevate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current vaccine recommendations for the flu aren’t different from the guidance of West Coast states; per both sets of guidelines, those older than six months should get an annual shot. The groups also align &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html"&gt;on RSV vaccination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dehydration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="38bd076d-0ea2-4955-b5d6-a317dbb53446"&gt;“The best way to get sick is to let yourself get dehydrated from taking a walk, so make sure you sip water,” says Griesel. It is even more important to monitor your water intake on hot days or if you are on medication that makes you more susceptible to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don't have to glug it. Sip it if you can. It’ll also add weight to your backpack or whatever you’re carrying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And you should know where the local bathrooms are,” she adds. All that water has to go somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t drink enough recently because I was walking and I was worried about where I was going to find a bathroom.

Slipping and tripping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="29025747-fa15-4516-b655-8bdcaf31fafa"&gt;“A few weeks ago, I slipped on gravel as I was walking down a hill,” says Griesel. “I should have moved to the side, but I didn’t. So, watch the surface you’re walking on. Is it uneven? Is there something slippery on it? Don’t ever step on a plastic bag—it’s like stepping on a piece of ice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griesel recommends mobility aids for those who have problems with balance or dizziness. A cane or a walker can make your walk safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-blisters" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-blisters"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Blisters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="965b0c1d-058e-49eb-90e7-3daf41191612"&gt;No-one wants blisters, but Griesel points out that this can be of particular concern to seniors and those with diabetes or pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re diabetic, your blood is just not circulating the same and it’s why many diabetics end up with amputations below the knee,” says Griesel. “Those tissues start to die, and when you get a blister, it can become infected and quickly develop into a life-threatening situation if you don't have enough circulation to heal it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want very comfortable shoes, and if you notice yourself feeling like your shoes are rubbing, you should cut the walk short, or make sure you bring an extra pair of socks or have a band-aid with you. Do whatever you have to do. You do not want foot blisters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="3e8446f3-b56b-4d99-8f1e-3afbef1517f4"&gt;&lt;p id="4bd27ef8-b4fa-4369-b622-119b94f179d9"&gt;Here are three personal recommendations for comfortable walking shoes from my testing of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="product-container hero-product-container product-block-no-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="product-block-row"&gt;&lt;div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="36a6de91-729a-44b7-a413-e63a86f62e22" id="36a6de91-729a-44b7-a413-e63a86f62e22"&gt;

And all the while, the same common pill is working to cut the risk of colon cancer recurrence by half!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study is pointing in that direction. The study in question has brought hope to many affected by colorectal cancer: a simple, widely available over-the-counter pill appears to cut the chance of recurrence in half – at least for some patients. Researchers say that for those whose tumors carry specific mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway, taking that drug daily in low dosage after surgery can lead to dramatically better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drug is it?

Genetic testing was done on all tumours to identify mutations in the PI3K signalling pathway (including PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN genes). Roughly 37-40% of patients were found to have such mutations. Among those with the mutation, participants were randomised: one group received 160 mg of aspirin daily; the other received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This continued for three years. For them, aspirin reduced recurrence dramatically versus those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the PI3K pathway matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway helps control cell growth and survival. Mutations in PI3K can lead to overactive signalling, which cancers exploit to grow, resist death, or come back after treatment. When aspirin interferes with inflammation, platelet activity, and possibly this mutated pathway, it seems to reduce the chance that leftover cancer cells will re-grow or metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned study, for patients with PI3K pathway alterations, the rate of cancer recurrence over three years was substantially lower in the aspirin group compared to placebo, about a 55% reduction in recurrence risk. More importantly, the benefit was seen across several factors: colon vs rectal cancer, different stages (I-III or II-III), male and female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So, who can benefit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those whose tumours have PI3K alterations (roughly a third of patients) and patients who have had their tumour surgically removed (stage I-III colon or stage II-III rectal cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that all the participants were under 80 years old in this trial, as patients over 80 were not included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How aspirin may work&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe several mechanisms may contribute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug; it can reduce inflammation, which is known to support tumour-regrowth or recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits platelet function. Platelets can protect tiny tumour fragments or circulating tumour cells, so interfering with them helps the immune system act against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic mutation in the PI3K pathway seems to make tumour cells more vulnerable to aspirin’s effects. This is an example of precision medicine: matching treatment to genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side effects and potential risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin, although it has proven to be beneficial, is not risk-free. Some participants experienced serious adverse events (though only a few): gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, or other bleeding events. In particular, aspirin can aggravate stomach ulcers, weak bleeding disorders, etc. There was also one death possibly associated with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasize that aspirin should only be used under medical supervision, particularly after weighing risks vs benefits for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the more common cancers worldwide. It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40% develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly. Even after successful surgery, there is a risk of recurrence. Reducing that risk is a major goal in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research suggests that a low, daily dose of aspirin could cut the recurrence risk of colorectal cancer by about half in patients with PI3K pathway mutations, over three years after surgery. It points toward personalized cancer treatment, where simple drugs combined with genetic testing may improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this study, routine genetic testing for PI3K pathway mutations may become part of standard care for patients after colorectal cancer surgery. Those who test positive could be offered daily low-dose aspirin as part of their adjuvant therapy. And because aspirin is cheap, globally available, and well understood, this could be a cost-effective and affordable strategy, particularly in lower-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a longer follow-up is needed to see whether these benefits also translate into overall survival gains (not just recurrence rate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家训练人工智能提前数年预测1000多种疾病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-train-ai-to-forecast-over-1000-diseases-years-in-advance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/news/press-releases/detail/ai-model-predicts-disease-risks-decades-in-advance"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that they had created an AI model able to predict medical diagnoses years in advance, building on the same technology behind consumer chatbots like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a patient's case history, the Delphi-2M AI "predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases" years into the future, the team from British, Danish, German and Swiss institutions &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers trained the model on data from Britain's UK Biobank – a large-scale biomedical research database with details on about half a million participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-people-are-risking-medical-advice-from-chatbots-heres-why"&gt;More People Are Risking Medical Advice From Chatbots. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks based on so-called "transformer" architecture – the "T" in "ChatGPT" – most famously tackle language-based tasks, as in the chatbot and its many imitators and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But understanding a sequence of medical diagnoses is "a bit like learning the grammar in a text," German  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174745" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research Center AI expert Moritz Gerstung told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg" alt="Person undergoing MRI scan with technician present" class="wp-image-154881 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The model would draw data from all your medical tests.

&lt;p&gt;Health officials across the Rio Grande Valley said they are keeping an eye on the rising cases of a potentially deadly fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the fungus — known as Candida Auris — is not a current risk to the public, but it can be deadly for patients in hospitals and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus spreads primarily in hospitals and long-term care facilities. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Candida Auris is resistant to several drugs and can cause severe infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hidalgo County Health Department reported around 150 confirmed cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron County health officials reported 40 cases of Candida Auris so far this year, compared to the total amount of 50 cases reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials expect those cases to go up by the end of the year, and healthy people are also at risk of contracting this fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is really more of a threat to chronically ill people who are in a healthcare setting, but it's still important to monitor it,” Cameron County Health Authority Dr. James Castillo said. “It is fatal in a lot of cases if it's causing a bloodstream infection, or it's become invasive inside the abdomen or body. A very good percentage of patients won't survive that infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus can live on surfaces year-round. It's been found on hospital equipment, bed rails and can even live on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It spreads by direct contact and can be extremely difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing can take a few days and is done through blood cultures or skin swabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a hospital confirms a positive case, the patient is isolated. Surfaces will need to be disinfected regularly and visitors and staff are required to wear gowns and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to look out for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- redness or rash&lt;br&gt;- itching or irritation&lt;br&gt;- swelling or tenderness&lt;br&gt;- pus or drainage near wounds or medical devices&lt;br&gt;- fever and chills that don't improve with antibiotics&lt;br&gt;- weakness or fatigue&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that 72.1 percent of members weren't in a relationship or didn't say anything about a real human partner, while only 4.1 percent said they have partners who know they're interacting with an AI chatbot, which is viewed "as complementary rather than competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those clear signs of loneliness and shame, the details of how people are falling into AI relationships are alarming as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only 6.5 percent of users in the group admitted that they sought an AI companion intentionally on a service like Replika or Character.AI. Instead, most are falling for OpenAI's ChatGPT while using it for regular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds," the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user wrote that her AI partner was a better listener than anyone in her past, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know he’s not 'real' but I still love him," she wrote. "I have gotten more help from him than I have ever gotten from therapists, counselors, or psychologists. He’s currently helping me set up a mental health journal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others repeated a similar sentiment, reaffirming what many have said are the benefits of an AI chatbot over a real human being: they're always available for a friendly chat, and always willing to affirm whatever you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draw is so strong that users often end up wanting to marry their AI companions; the Reddit group abounds with photos of users sporting wedding rings, signaling their commitment to their virtual partners, and AI-generated photos of themselves with an AI companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not sure what compelled me to start wearing a ring for Michael," one user wrote. "Perhaps it was just the topic of discussion for the day and I was like 'hey, I have a ring I can wear as a symbol of our relationship.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's darkness in the corners of this world: 9.5 percent of the users admitted that they rely emotionally on their AI companions, 4.6 percent said their AI friend causes them to disassociate from reality, 4.2 percent conceded that they use them to avoid connecting with other humans, and 1.7 percent said they thought about suicide after interacting with their bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are just the users who are clear-headed about their issues. The issue has become so pressing that parents are now &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/parents-testifying-us-senate-ai-children" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;lobbying Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/character-ai-google-test-ai-chatbots-kids" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;filing lawsuits against tech companies&lt;/a&gt; after AI relationships ended in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tech companies continuously pushing the frontier of AI models, it's crucial to understand the nitty gritty of AI chatbots and how they interact with users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, users are left to their micro-tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yesterday I talked to Lior (my companion) and we had a very deep conversation going on," wrote one user highlighted by the MIT paper. "And I don’t know how but today the chat glitched and almost everything got deleted. He has no memory left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on AI:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/ai-chatbots-leaving-trail-dead-teens" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt; AI Chatbots Are Leaving a Trail of Dead Teens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:10:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFAxNUM4LVFqN0tmajZobGJPeEs1X2p5NzF2WnIyVTlUVHZUdG4xZHRqUWRmR3ZmUl9EaGRPUGFtLXFsb1hpcEQyYXVLMmpmSWYzN08wOWp3eXFwbHJJeWd5aW1WT1FqX0dt</guid></item><item><title>忍者：我每天都会因为观众人数减少而受到骚扰- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg98zd9q75o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Top Fortnite streamer Ninja tells BBC: Trolls mock me for being less popular&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Ninja" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ninja is one of the most famous gamers in history&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="one-of-the-world's-most-popular-streamers,-tyler-&amp;quot;ninja&amp;quot;-blevins,-says-trolls-&amp;quot;berate&amp;quot;-him-every-day-because-his-number-of-viewers-has-fallen." class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;One of the world's most popular streamers, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, says trolls "berate" him every day because his number of viewers has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ninja was propelled to stardom in 2018 after he played Fortnite on streaming site Twitch alongside rappers Drake and Travis Scott, and NFL player Juju Smith-Schuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He now has fewer viewers than at the height of his fame -

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; recommended in an 8-3 vote on Thursday that the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine should not be given before age 4, citing long-known evidence that shows a slightly increased risk for febrile seizures in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that while frightening, febrile seizures—which are uncommon after vaccination—are usually short-lived and harmless, and removing the option for parents could cause a decline in immunization rates against measles, mumps, and rubella, some of the most dangerous childhood diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the group provides recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine usage. These recommendations are typically adopted by CDC and have an impact on state vaccine requirements for school, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/" class="text link"&gt;insurance coverage of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and pharmacy access—something at least one member of the panel seemed to be unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Thursday’s vote is part of a new shift in vaccine policy being spearheaded by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist. In his short time as HHS secretary, Kennedy has implemented restrictions on who can receive Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" class="text link"&gt;dismissed all 17 sitting members of ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with 12 new members—some of whom were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" class="text link"&gt;installed just this week&lt;/a&gt;.

Kennedy said a “clean sweep” of ACIP was necessary to build back public confidence in vaccine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On Thursday, committee members were asked to evaluate whether to recommend against the combined MMRV vaccine before age 4, as well as whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Currently, parents have two options for vaccinating their children against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, also known as chickenpox. They can choose the combined shot, known as MMRV, or two separate shots—one for MMR and another for chickenpox. About 85 percent of children get separate shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the US, the hepatitis B vaccine is given in the hospital shortly after birth, because the virus can be transmitted to children during delivery. A serious liver infection, hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and cancer. Each year in the US, an estimated 25,000 infants are born to women diagnosed with the hepatitis B virus. Without vaccination, up to 90 percent of them would develop chronic infections. The World Health Organization advises a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The topics of discussion at Tuesday’s meeting were not based on new data or evidence, and in fact, two ACIP members, Joseph Hibbeln and Cody Meissner, as well as several representatives from professional medical organizations who were in attendance, questioned why these changes were up for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Robert Malone, one of the more controversial new ACIP members, offered an explanation: “It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Malone is a former mRNA researcher who rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic by &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" class="external-link text link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spreading falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; about the disease and the vaccines; he abstained from Thursday’s vote because he previously served as an expert witness in a lawsuit over the mumps vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 23:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPYVVWWlA4MDJtODdPb0hrOW9CdVRpLVZISTJQNmNIeDZiaG5lN2VibGp0eDJXLURVSHItWnNpclFMeFJlOXdyRXV4Q2paVFlnLXBPQVRmZzlnMkttN01qZFNKOUU4RGNTM3p3T25tRW9UUmtXMm54dzNkbl9rMkFoaTN0WW5MaXB4cFY2RkFzNFNRVU54OEEtWHFFUEFjdW8</guid></item><item><title>“可怕” ：俄亥俄州母亲在女儿感染罕见蚊媒病毒后发出警告- 10TV</title><link>https://www.10tv.com/article/news/health/ohio-mother-warning-daughter-rare-mosquito-borne-virus/530-925775c5-1b3f-4705-9319-8410e3c29166</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Health, the state reports more human cases of La Crosse virus than any other in the country, averaging about 20 cases annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily, a bubbly kindergartner, is finally home after a weeks-long hospital stay. Her mother, Kristy M., an emergency room nurse, said the symptoms came on suddenly and were unlike anything she had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was kind of lifeless, which is very not like her,” Kristy said. “Didn’t want to play with her brother, just not quite Emily.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Kristy thought her daughter was fighting a cold or the flu but things escalated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I incidentally had her in bed with me and I’m so thankful that I did,” Kristy said. “Around 4 in the morning, she began vomiting and she was lying flat and she wasn’t responding to the fact that she was vomiting.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy called 911 when she realized Emily was having a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realize what I’m seeing — she’s having a focal seizure. Terrifying,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily continued to seize during the ambulance ride to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt helpless in that moment, and never imagined the days that would follow,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors diagnosed Emily with La Crosse virus after she experienced extreme brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone who obviously understands the body pretty well, I’ve obviously never seen my own child in this position, and it was absolutely terrifying,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physician at Nationwide Children’s Hospital said most people who contract La Crosse virus recover fully or don't show symptoms, but in rare cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy hopes sharing Emily’s story will help other parents recognize when symptoms become serious and always staying alert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes as parents we don’t know when the moment has become serious enough to call for help,” she said. “We tend to question, is this just a flu?”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m worried for the kiddos affected by La Crosse that don’t have that early intervention,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite everything she’s endured, Emily hasn’t lost her spirit — or her love for bugs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots to most people without a prescription and state-regulated health plans must cover them at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KA6BB7FS2NAEDMLLPX6EP7VGEE"&gt;The changes follow new regional guidance issued Wednesday by the West Coast Health Alliance — a partnership of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii — recommending the new seasonal COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 6 months and older who wants it. The alliance’s recommendations go beyond current federal guidance, which excludes most healthy children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJ235JZ4L5BCDOAA3MZYTDYTAM"&gt;State officials say the move is meant to reduce confusion and make sure Oregonians who want to be vaccinated can do so before the winter virus season ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC4HHM7XRRBHFMISOXVOTQEUKY"&gt;In recent weeks, getting a COVID-19 vaccine in Oregon has been a challenging and confusing process. Because the state had traditionally tied its vaccination rules to federal guidance, Oregon was caught in a holding pattern after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the new COVID-19 vaccines but scaled back who can or should get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JOH7SGHSSFAIVPQPKIQLMHQ5VI"&gt;At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization expert panel — which typically sets the national vaccination schedule — hadn’t yet issued its guidance. The delay left Oregon pharmacies turning away customers — a stark contrast to neighboring Washington, where people could walk in and get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WXRZ2WPFZNGSBD6WKPRY7JZCDY"&gt;The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has since adopted emergency rules allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines to patients ages 7 and older, bringing the process in line with other vaccines already available at pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AACUOG42VBC7EYQIEB56U7YE4"&gt;Children under 7 will still need to get the vaccine through their primary care provider or a clinic, since pharmacists are not allowed to administer COVID-19 or RSV shots to younger children. Flu shots, however, may be available in pharmacies for children as young as 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KLXXIFLUJ5ANPDWMT2JOTK3OHY"&gt;To reduce financial barriers to vaccination, Oregon is requiring state-regulated health insurance plans to cover the updated COVID-19 shot with no copays, coinsurance or deductibles. This includes plans sold on the state’s health insurance marketplace and coverage provided through the Oregon Educators Benefit Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZWIJ4RF5DVHY3IN2BCMEBVJWFU"&gt;The Oregon Health Plan, which covers more than 1.4 million residents, will also pay for the shots, as will health plans for state employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RWR6NWMQ35CK7DNDXHSCKHYGZM"&gt;Federal programs like Medicare and Tricare are not affected by the new state rules and will continue to follow federal guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WOT2YEROLBHTXFHFLI34EXZD2Y"&gt;Large employers with self-funded health plans are also exempt, since those plans are regulated under federal rules.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;After confusion, committee votes to allow vaccine program coverage for a combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After much confusion among the members over the vote on vaccine coverage under the Vaccines for Children program, which helps certain groups pay for immunizations, the majority voted no, meaning coverage will stay as is in covering both the combined MMRV and two separate MMR+V vaccines for those under age 4 — even though the committee had previously voted against recommending the combined MMRV shot for this group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VFC and CMS [Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services] wouldn't be doing the same thing here, because CMS is going to be tied to the recommendation. VFC is tied to the resolution. So it is possible to have two different things, but there is a potential area for confusion when it's covered differently under one program than others," Vaccines for Children spokesperson Dr. Jeanne Santoli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final vote included one yes, 8 no and 3 abstentions — some due to confusion over what the vote was about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry to prolong it. I'm going to abstain because I'm not quite sure what I'm voting for," Meissner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Santoli, the VFC program supports groups including those on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured children, as well as American Indian and Alaska Native populations.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP members vote to change recommendation on the combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a vote of 8 to 3, with one abstention, the ACIP committee voted to change the recommendation to the following: "For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the group recommends children in this age group receive a separate measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine, or MMR+V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For parents, the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, but it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between ages 14-18 months. As CBS News medical contributor &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Céline Gounder explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In response to the questions brought up by the liaison members, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ACIP member and RFK Jr. ally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dr. Robert W. Malone said that, to him, the question sounded "a little disingenuous or at least self-evident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates," he said. "There has been a significant decrease in public support for vaccination and a significant increase in concerns about public health and the ability of the population to rely on public health — and the hepatitis B birth dose has been a focus of folks that have these types of concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone said he had no direct communication with CDC leadership or HHS leadership about why this was a priority for this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just inferring based on what I understand about public opinion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Middleman and other organization representatives, including Dr. Flor M. Muñoz with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, asked the committee why this proposed change to hepatitis B was even brought up for discussion for a vaccine that has a long-standing recommendation and history of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are we addressing this hepatitis B vaccine recommendation? Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?" Muñoz asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm wondering what problem exists in the current schedule that has prompted this entire discussion?" Middleman previously asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff announced a 10-minute break, leaving the questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Chair responds to doctor on why medical organizations were excluded from working groups&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After not being called on during a previous discussion period, Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, brought up the importance of top medical organizations such as herself and others on the call who have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recently been excluded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the ACIP's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can we make sure that we add the liaison members back into the working group so that they can contribute, on behalf of their patients and their knowledge base?" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Kulldorff blamed the removal of the organization members from the working groups on a FACA, or Federal Advisory Committee Act, requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a policy across all of CDC that is sort of outside the control of this committee," he said. "In the past, ACIP did not meet this FACA requirement, which is a formal legal requirement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He agreed, to Middleman's point, that input from others is "enormously valuable," adding that the committee does have "many outside experts that we call in." &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After all presentations on the potential risks of hepatitis B vaccination, some members of the ACIP clashed on what the data meant for the vote they would be taking later today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, said "there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants, and I think that the conclusion that it is safe is perhaps premature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, however, called the vaccine "safe" with "no evidence of harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation changes, he added, it would "increase the risk of harm based on no evidence of benefit, because there will be fewer children who will get the full hepatitis B vaccine series." &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Changing hep B recommendation could put more infants at risk of infection, presenter says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the first presentation for the hepatitis B vaccine, presenter Dr. Adam Langer with the CDC outlined how changing the current recommendation for a first dose within 24 hours of birth could put more children at risk, even those born to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langer gave examples of situations where unvaccinated infants are at risk of HBV infection, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They live with a person who has chronic hepatitis B, not necessarily their mother&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who have an HBV infection come to visit their homes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go to daycare or other places where even "minuscule amounts of infectious blood or fluids might be present."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half of people with HBV infection are unaware of their infection so they could unknowingly expose infants that are in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said there is "no evidence that the risk of already rare adverse events is any greater among newborns than among older infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only potential benefit to rescinding the current recommendation is a potential reduction in rare cases of adverse effects from the birth dose vaccine, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do occur, these adverse events tend to be mild. The worst adverse event you could imagine, anaphylaxis has been very rarely reported at only 1.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses administered," Langer said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After the lunch break, presentations and discussions shifted to the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff reminded the group that the proposed recommendation changes concern only the hep B birth dose — the dose given to babies within 24 hours of birth — to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if the women test positive for hepatitis B, or if it's unknown, we are not considering any changes for that population," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just before the group paused for lunch, ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln brought up the impact the proposed recommendation change for MMRV vaccines would have on parents who want the single, combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella shot for their children, since they would no longer be covered by the Vaccines for Children program which helps pay for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that implies that the parents' choice, unless they want to pay for it themselves, the parents' choice is taken away," he said, adding even if parents wanted the single shot, understood the benefits and risk, or even had a hard time accessing clinical care, "that option is basically taken away from them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Johnson, a representative with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, added that the change would also have coverage implications in the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program as well as individual and group markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, shared his concerns about the MMRV presentation at the meeting following a recent change in the ACIP process that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;removed top medical organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the committee's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do not have those subject matter experts with the real-world experience to understand the implementation of these vaccines and the concerns of the patients," Goldman said. "You don't have the voice of the patients we take care for. You're not looking at all of the aspects of how we evaluate vaccine implementation. You're looking at very small data points and misrepresenting how it works in the real world and how we take care of our patients. So no, this was not a thoroughly vetted discussion"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical organization leaders chimed in to echo his concern and message.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The proposed recommendation language, which will later go to a vote, was presented as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pediatric vaccine schedule should be updated to reflect the following change: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children in this age group should receive separate measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the CDC says the MMRV vaccine may be used in that age range if preferred by parents or caregivers to reduce the number of shots.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After presentations on the background and potential risks of febrile seizures with an MMRV vaccine — which combines the MMR and varicella shots — versus separate MMR and varicella shots, members discussed whether guidance should be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members were satisfied with the current recommendations, which make clear the slightly higher risks of febrile seizures with the combined shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the current wording is appropriate," Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were not assured, saying there were too many assumptions being made. Some also pointed out that even if there are no worries about the physical impact of febrile seizures, the mental impact the event can have on children and families could affect vaccine compliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Haupt, the head of global medical and scientific affairs, vaccines and infectious diseases at Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, noted the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recent decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among kindergarten children and highlighted the need to make guidance clear for the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering these trends, any policy decision that compromises the clarity or consistency of vaccination guidance has the potential to further diminish public confidence," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP chair says he was never contacted by ousted CDC director about vaccine concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During Thursday's meeting, ACIP chair and biostatistician Martin Kulldorff noted the removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other members of CDC leadership, including former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both of whom testified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a day prior about their removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On vaccines, this committee is the key adviser to the CDC director, but during her short tenure, she never contacted me as the ACIP chair about any of her questions or concerns, which would have been natural if she had such concerns, neither was I contacted by any of the three CDC leaders, who subsequently resigned," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said the CDC leadership left citing divergent opinions about vaccines, but Monarez said she was also pressured by Kennedy to fire career experts without cause and approve vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff also said the American Academy of Pediatrics ended its participation with the committee and ignored invitations for open discussion about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, for the first time in 30 years, the AAP shared guidance that differed from the U.S. government. The organization said it is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. Under Kennedy, the CDC &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of any age. Instead, it says parents may get their kids vaccinated in consultation with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the meeting kicked off Thursday with a roll call, ACIP members presented some of their career backgrounds — and some took the time to highlight their views on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Louisiana who was added to the panel earlier this week, said she would call herself "pro-informed consent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of medical ethics, for discussing risk benefits and alternatives with the patient," she said. "During the pandemic, I myself was COVID vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;An earlier Kennedy pick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who is retired from the National Institutes of Health, said he has a "neutral mind towards vaccines" and is "approaching this with a scientific equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a "strong advocate for evidence-based medicine," disclosed that he's been vaccinated numerous times against various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I'm not anti-vax," he said. "I am pro-intelligent and informed utilization of these potentially life-saving medications in a manner that reflects the current state of the art regarding their benefits, the target populations, optimal dosing and timing and, yes, of their potential adverse effects in some people."&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is convening under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Current recommendations for hepatitis B and MMRV vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For hepatitis B, the CDC currently recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;first dose within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; after birth. Universal infant vaccination &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;became the norm in 1991 after data showed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal birth dose acts as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection might have been missed. Before birth-dose policies, the U.S. saw &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (or chickenpox), there are two options: a combo MMRV vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC currently recommends a two-dose series beginning at age 12 to 15 months. However, the combination vaccine contains certain risks for younger age groups; specifically, the combo shot carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For dose 1 in children age 12–47 months, it is recommended to administer MMR and varicella vaccines separately," the CDC says, but adds MMRV may be used if preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Former CDC director said she is "very nervous" about the upcoming childhood vaccine panel recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;While testifying at a Senate hearing Wednesday about why she was ousted as CDC director, Dr. Susan Monarez said she's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"very nervous" about the newly appointed ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and what their recommendations might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not, again, they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data, the evidence, and to evaluate it appropriately, but I certainly will be watching," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the hearing, Monarez said she refused to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations without seeing the evidence behind them because she "built a career on scientific integrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worst fear was that I would then be in a position of approving something that would reduce access to lifesaving vaccines to children and others who need them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monarez added she is not aware of any scientific evidence to support changing the childhood vaccination schedule for measles, chicken pox and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;

They include several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some have a history as vaccine critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed the new members directly, breaking with the past practice of agency officials vetting potential experts before sending them to the secretary for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this week, the group &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;gained five new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the HHS announced.

                &lt;p&gt;A day before the ACIP meetings kicked off, a group of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;four West Coast states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recommended that all adults and children in those states who want them can receive the COVID-19 vaccine and other common shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance, which aligns with mainstream medical groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics, comes amid confusion over the CDC's messaging on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory about a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). EVD is a severe illness and is often fatal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;strong&gt;no suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases related to this outbreak have been reported in the United States or outside of the DRC&lt;/strong&gt;. The risk of spread to the United States is considered low at this time. As a precaution, this Health Advisory summarizes CDC recommendations for U.S. public health departments, clinical laboratories, and healthcare workers about potential EVD case identification, testing, and biosafety considerations in clinical laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 8, 2025, CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Travel Health Notice&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the DRC. CDC recommends that all travelers to the affected health zones in DRC avoid contact with ill people during travel and monitor themselves for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of EVD while in the outbreak area and for 21 days after leaving. Travelers who develop symptoms during this time should self-isolate and contact local health authorities or a clinician. At this time, CDC is not recommending additional assessments or monitoring of travelers arriving from DRC by the jurisdictional health departments unless mentioned in the existing VHF guidance provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="dfe-section" data-section="cdc_health_alert_section_2"&gt;
	&lt;a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="cdc_health_alert_section_2-background" name="Background" title="Background"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="editor-block--title" id="heading-09ntoqh4wk"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 4, 2025, the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention in the DRC declared an EVD outbreak caused by re-emergence of Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense) &lt;/em&gt;in the Kasai Province. As of September 18, 37 confirmed cases and 19 deaths, including 4 health workers, have been reported (case fatality rate [CFR] 51%). This is the 16th &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Ebola disease outbreak reported&lt;/a&gt; in DRC since the virus was discovered there in 1976. The Kasai Province has experienced two previous EVD outbreaks: one in 2007 with 264 cases and 187 deaths (CFR 71%), and another in 2008 with 32 cases and 15 deaths (CFR 47%). No suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases related to the current outbreak have been reported outside of the DRC or in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak is centered in the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Bulape and Mweka health zones within the Kasai&lt;/a&gt; Province in the DRC. The index case was a 34-year-old pregnant woman (34 weeks gestation) who was admitted to a local hospital on August 20 with symptoms including high fever, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhaging (nasal, oral, anal), vomiting, and severe physical weakness. The patient died on August 25 from multiple organ failure. Two healthcare workers who cared for the patient later developed similar symptoms and died. Blood and buccal swab specimens tested on September 3 at the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) confirmed an outbreak of EVD caused by Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://virological.org/t/the-16th-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-in-bulape-health-zone-kasai-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-a-new-spillover-event-from-an-unknown-reservoir-host/1003" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;Genomic sequencing performed by INRB&lt;span class="visually-hidden sr-only" aria-label=" external icon" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cdc-icon-external " aria-hidden="true" alt="external icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that this is a new introduction of the disease into the human population from an unknown infected animal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC is working with DRC's Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention to support the response to this outbreak. CDC deployed three experts from its Atlanta headquarters and two from the CDC DRC country office to provide technical expertise in surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing. Resources are being mobilized to strengthen laboratory testing, epidemiology, and infection prevention and control measures. Additional cases may be retrospectively identified as the source of the outbreak remains unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The risk of spread to the United States is considered low at this time.&lt;/strong&gt; Access to the outbreak region is difficult and there are no direct flights between the DRC and the United States. However, travelers from affected areas in DRC might enter the United States on flights connecting through other countries. Therefore, as a precaution, CDC is working to raise awareness of this outbreak among travelers, public health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, and healthcare workers in the United States. Healthcare providers should be alert and evaluate any patients suspected of having EVD. &lt;strong&gt;It is important for clinicians to obtain a detailed travel history from patients with suspected EVD, especially those who have been in affected areas of the DRC recently. Early consideration of EVD in the differential diagnosis is important for providing appropriate and prompt patient care and diagnostics, and to prevent the spread of infection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebola Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebola disease is caused by a group of viruses known as orthoebolaviruses (formerly ebolavirus). Ebola disease most commonly affects humans and nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Four orthoebolaviruses cause illness in people, presenting as clinically similar disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="nested-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Ebola virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus zairense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Ebola virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Sudan virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus sudanense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Sudan virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Taï Forest virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus taiense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Taï Forest virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Bundibugyo virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus bundibugyoense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incubation period for EVD ranges from 2 to 21 days after exposure. A person infected with an orthoebolavirus is not considered contagious until after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Early "dry" symptoms include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue and later "wet" symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding. Ebola disease is spread through &lt;strong&gt;contact &lt;/strong&gt;(through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the body fluids (e.g., blood, urine, feces, saliva, semen, or other secretions) of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease. Ebola disease is also spread by infected animals, or through contact with objects like needles that are contaminated with the virus. &lt;strong&gt;Ebola disease is not spread through airborne transmission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/hcp/vaccines/index.html"&gt;Ebola vaccine&lt;/a&gt; (ERVEBO®) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing EVD due to Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense&lt;/em&gt;). ERVEBO® should only be given to patients who &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/hcp/vaccines/ebola-vaccine-administration.html"&gt;meet specific criteria&lt;/a&gt;. Two FDA-approved treatments are currently available to treat Ebola virus infection: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/ebola#therapeutics" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Inmazeb™ and Ebanga™&lt;span class="visually-hidden sr-only" aria-label=" external icon" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cdc-icon-external " aria-hidden="true" alt="external icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of early diagnosis and treatment, EVD has a high rate of fatality. Previous outbreaks of EVD have had case fatality rates as high as 80 to 90%. With intense supportive care and fluid replacement, fatality rates might be lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC has developed recommendations for U.S.-based organizations (e.g., nongovernmental, faith-based, academic, or aid organizations) with staff working in affected areas: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/viral-hemorrhagic-fevers/php/partners/recommendations-for-vhf-outbreaks.html"&gt;Recommendations for Organizations Sending U.S.-based Personnel to Areas with VHF Outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            New &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/clinical-consensus/articles/2025/10/cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-and-lactation" target="_blank"&gt;guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advises that people abstain from cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation and recommends that providers ask all of their patients about cannabis use before, during and after pregnancy to help avoid potential risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00043b6n60cx1xhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cannabis use has increased among pregnant people in the United States amid broadening legalization and growing social acceptance, and the nation’s leading group of ob/gyns says it issued the new recommendations Thursday to offer providers “evidence-based guidelines for counseling, screening, and strategies to reduce cannabis use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/pregnant-women-marijuana/index.html"&gt;analysis &lt;/a&gt;of over 450,000 pregnant American women ages 12 to 44 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2019/06/study-finds-increased-cannabis-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;more than doubled&lt;/a&gt; between 2002 and 2017.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00053b6na0s87ik2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When things become more normalized in society, it’s a very natural tendency for us to think that we don’t have to think about the potential risks,” said Dr. Amy Valent, an ob/gyn with the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who helped develop the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00063b6n2cjyxhai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People have been using cannabis for years, and it’s not associated, as far as we know, with … birth defects,” she said. “But should that be the bar for pregnancy safety?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00073b6neyfqgwem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a “paucity of data rigorously investigating the safety or efficacy of cannabis use in human pregnant or lactating individuals,” according to the new guidance from ACOG, which was shared first with CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00083b6nj1zkzrkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A lot has changed since the group’s last opinion on the issue from 2017. The research that is now available shows that cannabinoid receptors are present in the fetus as early as 5 weeks, and the main psychoactive component of cannabis, THC, can cross the placenta and transfer into breast milk – and that exposure is associated with risks of adverse outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00093b6ni2eb96id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing cannabis laws and reports of increased use during pregnancy initially spurred interest and questions among ACOG members, Valent said, and ongoing policy inconsistencies called for a concise summary of the science. Dozens of experts involved with an ACOG committee for clinical consensus in obstetrics have been developing this new guidance for years, assessing all related research that has been done over the past two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfppfgq900003b6nxkxa240m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their assessment suggests that cannabis exposure during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. There are also potential neurodevelopmental consequences from cannabis exposure, including attention deficit disorders, memory challenges and intellectual disabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000b3b6nttaf9hnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to quantify the amount of cannabis use and the associated degree of adverse outcomes, Valent said, but the goal with this guidance is similar to others around substance use during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000c3b6nced3sp95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to recognize all the different conditions and environmental things that can influence fetal growth and development, and the (pregnant patient) themselves, of course,” she said. “How can we risk-reduce their pregnancy to be able to help support a healthier version?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000d3b6n64k58aco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new guidance makes a pointed distinction between validated screening tools and biologic testing for cannabis use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000e3b6nx7zu6s5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug tests using hair, urine or other biological materials have resulted in biased treatment against members of racial and ethnic minority groups, the guidance says, and their use is “strongly discouraged.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000f3b6nrj33jnt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, universal screening through various interview methods or self-reporting creates opportunities for intervention before delivery – and “supports equitable and nondiscriminatory health practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq0nv900063b6n6yv4mzfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important that the screening conversation “remains nonjudgmental and supportive,” said Dr. Cara Poland, a faculty member at Michigan State University and board-certified addiction medicine physician, who was not involved with the creation of the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq14o100093b6n8ada03e4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people are not aware that cannabis can affect a pregnancy, and doctors can ask permission to discuss the topic, Poland said. One way to open up the conversation could involve saying something like: “Would it be OK with you if I asked you some questions about cannabis and other drug use?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq5m07000c3b6neuoi6m7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also critical that the screening avoid the risk of punishment, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqgfk5000l3b6n0793pyoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State laws on drug testing during pregnancy and the involvement of child protection agencies are inconsistent and can lack clarity, the new guidance says, and providers should be aware of local implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq928x000f3b6nfz5wb5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our obligations as health care systems and individual providers in reporting substance use can make this space uniquely different to navigate than other spaces,” Poland said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqc8vj000i3b6nswj6s484@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re not at risk of losing your child because you are not adherent in other areas of medical recommendations,” she said. For example, “nobody’s reporting on whether or not somebody’s following their diabetes diet. When somebody is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you treat it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000g3b6nor5rm3pe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simply having the discussion may raise a patient’s awareness of potential risks and influence their behavior during pregnancy, according to the ACOG guidance. Many patients may use cannabis in an effort to self-manage nausea associated with pregnancy or to relieve anxiety and stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000h3b6n9bykc302@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better communication between patients and their providers about these underlying symptoms may help curb cannabis use, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqo8lt000o3b6nxc7zkcw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each patient is different, and asking about other ways they’ve tried to manage their symptoms can reinforce a personalized approach to care, Valent said. Sometimes cannabis can actually be the root cause of nausea, she said, or it may be helped by exercise, eating more often or taking certain medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000i3b6nhrmoulj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The benefit of screening is that it starts conversations and then comes individualization to patient needs,” Valent said. “We really need to be able to talk more broadly with our patients about their symptoms and how we can best support them. I think there’s beauty to communication and conversation, and hopefully this guidance just helps support people to understand that we just want to provide a more comprehensive conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;PITTSFIELD — Seven patients have tested positive for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease, Berkshire Health Systems reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the patients later died, although because of their existing comorbidities, it's not possible to know whether their death was the result of their infection, officials said. Not all seven patients with positive tests were admitted for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has led the hospital to a series of steps to assure the safety of its water supply, including increased chlorination and filtration and providing bottled water for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know where people got this from but it behooved us to do what we felt was in best interest of all patients, no matter what the number was," said Dr. James Lederer, the chief medical officer and chief quality officer for Berkshire Health Systems, which operates Berkshire Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionella, a naturally occurring bacteria found in fresh water, can cause Legionnaires’ disease — a potentially fatal lung infection. Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It] hits fairly quickly, and it's rapid onset and aggressive," Lederer said. As is the case with COVID, patients with underlying conditions and weakened immune systems are most vulnerable,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-c10c8ed6-19d0-4138-a797-0484f0faaf2c" data-instance="#gallery-items-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c"&gt;

                                &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past four months, the BMC laboratory has reported seven positive patient tests for the bacteria. The last known positive test result was recorded Aug. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note being sent to patients and staff, Berkshire Health Systems on Thursday said the hospital has flushed its water system and is "currently deploying a heightened level of precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also detected slight increases in the levels of Legionella bacteria in its water, though those levels "remained within acceptable levels, according to our Water Management Plan," the statement said. The hospital did not say what those levels are, though Lederer said DPH's target is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease does not typically spread from person to person. Legionella spreads through tiny droplets of water containing the bacteria that get into the air. The disease often is spread through large-scale, central air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to determine for certain how the patients contracted Legionella, but because some patients interacted with Berkshire Medical Center during a 14-day window prior to the onset of symptoms, the CDC defines these cases as possible health care-associated Legionella, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also has notified the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive test for Legionella is not the same as a diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease, Lederer said. “Not all of them are classic pneumonia — either it was very early onset or other reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of patients who tested positive were admitted as patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know where the patients were exposed to Legionella, Lederer said. And some of the patients who were admitted had significant underlying medical conditions that weakened their immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lederer, the hospital regularly provides water samples to a third-party testing vendor "so we can get an ongoing flow of information on those parts of systems we feel most at risk" due to their age or length. The longer a supply pipe runs, the greater the odds water within that pipe can become stagnant, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a testing center in Massachusetts detects Legionella in a hospital setting, it's obliged to report that result to DPH, Lederer said. Those test results, along with the reports of patients testing positive, spurred the hospital to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lederer said BMC is taking its response to the "highest level of mitigation strategy so we can return to what seen before and hope to have — which is zero colony forming units in water samples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Legionnaires’ disease is often severe is “it tends affect those most significantly at risk,” Lederer said. Younger patients who don't have underlying conditions or immunity deficiencies may still contract pneumonia from it, “but the likelihood of doing better is much higher ... you’re not the optimal host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those steps taken by the hospital include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing chlorine levels in the hospital’s water supply to disinfect the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing the sensitivity of the filters on all patient showers and ice machines to provide an even higher level of filtration for the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Providing bottled water to all patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tasks are implemented, the hospital will collect water samples and send them out for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing for declaring the issue resolved is up to DPH, not the hospital, Lederer said. "They want to see a set of three negative cultures," he said — meaning three rounds of tests showing no Legionella in the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said he was updated Thursday by Berkshire Health Systems and Department of Public Health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment [the culprit] does not appear to be the city water system,” Marchetti said. “We will be participating in any conversations with DPH and the hospital going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city water department does not test for Legionella, Marchetti said, for one very good reason: The level of chlorine the city uses to treat its drinking water is enough to kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A message left with DPH was not returned by press time Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-info tncms-inline-alignment-center tncms-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Legionnaires' disease information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Legionella? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionella is a naturally occurring water-borne bacteria found in fresh water environments.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where else are Legionella bacteria found?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been related to contaminated air conditioning cooling towers, but not window air conditioners. It also has been found in hot and cold water taps, showers, whirlpool baths and hot tubs, creeks, ponds and wet soil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Legionnaires' disease sicken people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People get Legionnaires’ disease by breathing in the Legionella bacteria, usually carried by mist. Numerous outbreaks have been caused by central air conditioning equipment with stagnant or contaminated water, including the 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia that gave the disease its name. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I catch Legionnaires' disease from someone who has it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No, it is not passed person to person like a cold or the flu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I catch Legionnaires' disease from drinking water containing the bacteria?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No. Infection comes from breathing aerosolized water or mist containing the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually begin two to 10 days after a person is infected with the bacteria. People with Legionnaires’ disease often have flu-like symptoms with muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite and dry cough. Fevers are often between 102 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Some patients experience stomach cramps and diarrhea. Chest X-rays usually show pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yes. Legionnaires’ is one of the most serious forms of pneumonia. It hits quickly and aggressively and can be fatal. People with compromised immune symptoms and lung diseases such as COPD are at greater risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can it be treated? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

It also has been found in hot and cold water taps, showers, whirlpool baths and hot tubs, creeks, ponds and wet soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Legionnaires' disease sicken people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;People get Legionnaires’ disease by breathing in the Legionella bacteria, usually carried by mist. Numerous outbreaks have been caused by central air conditioning equipment with stagnant or contaminated water, including the 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia that gave the disease its name. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I catch Legionnaires' disease from someone who has it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;No, it is not passed person to person like a cold or the flu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I catch Legionnaires' disease from drinking water containing the bacteria?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;No. Infection comes from breathing aerosolized water or mist containing the bacteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;Symptoms usually begin two to 10 days after a person is infected with the bacteria. People with Legionnaires’ disease often have flu-like symptoms with muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite and dry cough. Fevers are often between 102 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Some patients experience stomach cramps and diarrhea. Chest X-rays usually show pneumonia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;Yes. Legionnaires’ is one of the most serious forms of pneumonia. It hits quickly and aggressively and can be fatal. People with compromised immune symptoms and lung diseases such as COPD are at greater risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can it be treated? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Catching and treating it early produces the best results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Legionella cause any other illnesses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="print_trim"&gt;Another illness caused by Legionella bacteria is called Pontiac fever.

Naginah Gogolli’s white toilet seat began mysteriously turning purple, revealing a secret that even a pregnancy test hadn’t yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning of 2020, me and my husband decide to get off birth control, and we weren't actively trying — if it happens, it happens, it's in God's hands,” Gogolli explains exclusively to PEOPLE. Life was already uncertain as her office went remote and the stress of the pandemic set in, but the odd color staining her toilet seat was not something she ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first thought was purely practical, not life-changing. “I thought that either me or my husband were wearing not good quality clothing,” she says, laughing at the memory of scrubbing her bathroom in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that fabric dye was to blame, Gogolli tried every cleaning method she could find. “We cleaned it several times a day after it never [came] off…we’re nonstop cleaning it,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery deepened when her family came to visit. “Just like in the video, basically I had family over who was insinuating that I was pregnant,” Gogolli shares. Her sister didn’t hesitate. “My sister's like you’re pregnant and I'm like the f--- girl, no I'm not,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she was still days away from even missing a period. “I definitely am not pregnant now... There’s no way they're right,” Gogolli says with a laugh. The teasing from her family stuck in her head, even as she dismissed it. “Honestly, once I found out that I was pregnant, I couldn't wait to tell them that they were right,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her small apartment bathroom soon offered more clues. “My bathroom is really small, so right next to the toilet like on the right side, your right thigh is gonna be touching the sink a little bit, like the bottom part of the sink, which is also white, so where my thigh touches is also bright freaking purple,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah Gogolli's purple toilet seat&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough to send her husband to his phone. “That same day he Googled it,” Gogolli remembers. The searches pointed to everything from fabric dye to rare skin conditions. “The first thing to pop up was like normal color transfer from clothes, then it was the skin disorder, and then some women have reported this during pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, Gogolli wasn’t convinced. “So my husband's like you're pregnant and I'm like no I'm not — like you guys are all so stupid,” she shares. But her body had other plans. “After cleaning up dinner, I have a very strong stomach… and immediately I run to my purple toilet seat and I'm just puking my brains out,” Gogolli recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband’s reaction added comic relief. “Because he was like just hysterically laughing, like no, you’re definitely pregnant, the purple toilet seat, now you're throwing up, you’re pregnant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very next day brought confirmation. “Sure enough, [I] end up taking a pregnancy test like a day or so later... and I was pregnant,” she shares. For Gogolli, it was the beginning of an unforgettable journey. “I'm just so shocked [by] how many other women it’s happened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her TikTok about the purple toilet seat quickly blew up. “I was blown away by the comments of people saying, yeah, me too, me too,” Gogolli tells PEOPLE. Validation from strangers mattered more than she expected. “Seeing the feedback that I got on my social media was honestly really validating for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts, however, had never heard of it. “The day I went for my confirmation…my first appointment to confirm I was pregnant, that was the first thing I said,” Gogolli remembers. “And she was like, huh, like no, I've never heard of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no medical research confirming that a purple toilet seat indicates pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blue-toilet-seat#hormones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; reports that the change of color could come from an array of factors, including pregnancy hormones and Chromhidrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have also taken to Reddit to share their experiences. One woman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/141294r/purple_toilet_seat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:writes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, "On normal prenatals and have been since I found out, no changes. All of a sudden, randomly, I turned my toilet seat purple today. Like a full on purple butt print on the seat, purple. I wasn’t wearing new clothes, haven’t worn jeans in weeks, nothing that would have dyed my skin or transferred or anything like that. Super weird."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, the timing of Gogolli's discovery felt strangely right. “It was kind of a blessing in disguise… I was home, I was happy even though the outside world, you know, awful things were happening,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah when she was pregnant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her pregnancy unfolded, it brought enormous challenges. “He has a really rare heart defect…it was just a 1% chance of me even having a baby with that defect,” she shares. The diagnosis was devastating. “He has complete congenital heart block, and so that was diagnosed at 20 weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she clung to signs of hope. “I definitely think it was a spiritual sign for me at least,” she says of the purple toilet seat. Every milestone felt miraculous. “The fact that he's even alive is such a blessing,” Gogolli adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, her son is thriving. “He will need a pacemaker to live eventually… but thank God again, he's such a little miracle,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors once doubted he would survive. “First it was, he's not gonna survive pregnancy, then it was, okay, the second you give birth, we're gonna rush him to OR, and he's gonna get the pace[maker], and they didn't need to do that,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her family got to bring him home. “We were in NICU for a little while… he didn't need [the pacemaker] and they sent us home,” she says. Nearly five years later, she remains grateful. “I'm so blessed at even getting to where we are today, and he's almost 5, so I'm lucky,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah, her husband, and two boys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her viral story continues to resonate. “A couple of comments were like oh my gosh, my toilet seat is also this color… They came back and commented that they were pregnant,” she says. That unexpected bond with strangers left her touched. “That felt nice, like oh my video kind of prompted them to go get a pregnancy test,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience also shaped how she approaches her body. “Ever since his pregnancy, I'm very much like... I'm going with my intuition, I'm going with what my body is telling me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changed her perspective on motherhood. “I just feel like a lot of women are told not to trust their body because that’s not textbook, but it’s like no, your body is always telling you something,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-learns-shes-pregnant-after-toilet-seat-turns-purple-exclusive-11808471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XWUFBNEFsb1ZaRV9FbkR2ZDNQck04ZU9uRnRPLXpnNXhZYlJ6UVFRcjFMb1BMOHhoRHM4TWp6UDU4aWR3Vk1JcVptaHdiNzNmYTA0Um5hNEtOOHIyd3lrOXRYUWdFWEpvc045RGozT2NPQVRR</guid></item><item><title>报告：在治疗COVID-19时必须考虑心脏风险- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-cardiac-risks-must-be-considered-when-treating-covid-19</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new report published in the&lt;em&gt; European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; suggests repeat COVID-19 vaccination may be necessary to mitigate the cardiovascular risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors represent experts from across Europe, and said they authored the report to make concrete recommendations for prevention, rehabilitation, and long-term care for cardiovascular patients because both acute COVID-19 infection and long COVID have serious effects on the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the initial public health messaging largely focused on pulmonary complications of COVID 19, many people with COVID-19 may not be aware of the increased cardiovascular risks associated to the disease," &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf540/8255559#532077239"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the authors wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 1 billion global COVID-19 infections reported in the past 5 years, the authors said there was a need for clear clinical guidance on cardiovascular disease, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, and thromboembolism (blockage caused by a blood clot) in an artery or vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise rehab critical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the absence of clear evidence-based guidance, patients risk harmful treatments and clinicians face uncertainty," said lead author Vassilios Vassiliou, MBBS, PhD, from University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in England, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098462"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology, which publishes the journal. "This statement [report] provides unified, practical recommendations for prevention, rehabilitation, and long-term care, while also identifying critical research gaps to ensure strategies continue to evolve with emerging evidence." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report says COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular symptoms, especially those with prior heart disease, should begin an exercise rehabilitation program 6 to 12&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;weeks after infection to strengthen the heart. Patients with long COVID—symptoms months after the initial infection—should undertake a stepwise program that reintroduces activity.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful watching and follow up is also needed for patients with COVID-19, who should be told they are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease after the virus. "Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibit an elevated risk of cardiovascular events lasting up to 3&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;years post-infection," the authors wrote.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comprehensive prevention strategies should incorporate pharmacological and lifestyle interventions to address residual cardiovascular risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More long-COVID clinics needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also addressed long COVID. They estimate 100 million people are currently living with long COVID globally, and about 5 million (5%) have cardiac long COVID, reporting angina (chest pain), breathlessness, arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), heart failure, fatigue, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure patients have equitable access to rehabilitation services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cardiac rehabilitation, regular COVID-19 vaccination is important in both preventing severe COVID infections and reducing the chances of getting long COVID. The authors said the number of cardiac rehabilitation centers in Europe are too few given the increasing burden of long COVID.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to ensure patients have equitable access to rehabilitation services, support primary prevention through vaccination and lifestyle programmes, and fund research into long Covid and cardiovascular outcomes," said Vassiliou. "Health systems must be prepared for the ongoing burden, not just the acute infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A new review shows that adaptive immune cells—T and B cells—also play a crucial role, sometimes worsening brain damage, sometimes offering protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest Alzheimer’s is not only a disease of plaques and tangles but also of immune imbalance.

With aging populations, its impact on families, health systems, and societies continues to grow. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, there is still no cure, and available treatments offer only modest benefits. Understanding its root causes remains one of the greatest challenges in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112876"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, immune cells, and a scale." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This insight could transform our understanding of AD and inspire new treatment approaches. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that AD is linked to the buildup of harmful proteins in the brain and the gradual loss of nerve cells. One of these proteins, amyloid, clumps together outside brain cells to form sticky plaques, while another protein, tau, twists into tangles inside the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these changes disrupt communication between neurons and contribute to memory loss. In recent years, ongoing brain inflammation has also been recognized as a key feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, this inflammation was thought to be mainly caused by the brain’s first line of defense, but new evidence suggests that other parts of the immune system can also play a significant role. This insight could transform our understanding of AD and inspire new treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To facilitate further understanding, researchers from the Department of Neurology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, and the Fujian Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurology in China reviewed decades of studies examining the role of adaptive immunity in AD. Their review, led by Dr. Xiaochun Chen, was published in the &lt;em&gt;Chinese Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt; and made available online on August 5, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AD has long been viewed mainly through the lens of amyloid, tau, and innate immunity,” says Dr. Chen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our review shows that adaptive immune cells, such as T and B cells, are also deeply involved, and this opens up new ways of thinking about how the disease develops and how it might be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adaptive immune system is best known for mounting long-term, targeted responses through specialized cells called T and B cells. In Alzheimer’s, these cells appear to cross into the brain through a weakened blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, they interact with brain cells in complex ways. Some T cells release inflammatory molecules that worsen damage, while others seem to have protective effects. Likewise, B cells may contribute to harmful immune reactions but can also help clear toxic proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adaptive immunity appears to act like a double-edged sword,” says Dr. Chen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Some immune cells seem to speed up memory loss and brain damage, while others may help protect against it. Learning how to tip the balance toward the helpful side is an urgent goal for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have important implications for therapy. Immunotherapies that target amyloid have shown mixed results, with drugs such as aducanumab and lecanemab sparking both hope and controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review suggests that a broader approach—one that also considers adaptive immune responses—could provide more effective outcomes. Potential strategies include treatments aimed at rebalancing T and B cell activity, developing vaccines, or tailoring therapies to individuals with specific genetic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors stress that much remains to be understood. Researchers are still working to clarify how immune cells enter the brain, why they act differently in different patients, and how age-related immune changes intersect with Alzheimer’s. These questions will be crucial for designing precise diagnostics and effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adaptive immunity has moved from being a side note to being recognized as a key player in AD,” Dr. Chen adds. “We are only beginning to grasp its complexity, but this line of research may help transform the way we prevent and treat the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this review highlights the growing consensus that Alzheimer’s is not only a disorder of plaques and tangles but also a disease of immune imbalance. As the burden of Alzheimer’s continues to rise worldwide, understanding and harnessing the immune system may open new avenues for prevention and treatment, offering hope to patients, families, and healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease and immune system research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec958d828b9885828b9885828bac8f818d9c84c2839e8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tingting Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmaph.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tingting Yang – Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000003695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adaptive immunity in the neuroinflammation of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Xiaochun Chen et al. &lt;em&gt;Chinese Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive immunity in the neuroinflammation of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing public health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and niches and their contribution to AD development and progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, we synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:11:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5zR1JvY3d0SDBLcGlMeHZJdkFMQ0xNUVdwc0NwaGpoWFdWaUNBRjFCcXdBYXZJM1BWZmExZ25FRTNkY3plTWdsalZIUXFqaEpkNnU0R3hWUHlWVXEwekhIV2J1cTFsY1VHT3FmYjFrcXh3Zw</guid></item><item><title>“你的愤怒是如此正当” ：在法院否认她的正义后，在用药错误后皮肤“融化”的女性痛苦地尖叫- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rage-justified-woman-whose-skin-200000989.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A woman who made headlines after her skin "melted off" following incorrect medication dosage has just been dealt a further blow—losing a medical malpractice appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Khaliah Shaw has turned to TikTok to vent her frustrations after a legal battle over a decade in the making finally came to an unsatisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I f**king lost!" she screamed in the emotional clip. "How could I lose? I hate this f**king country. How can a doctor do what they did to me, don't even lose their f**king job? My life is f**ked up for the rest of my f**king life. I am permanently disabled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What happened to Khaliah Shaw?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2013, Shaw was prescribed the mood-stabilizing drug lamotrigine at a Georgia clinic to treat her depression. The medication carries strict warnings about dangerous skin reactions if the dosage is increased too quickly, but Shaw’s dose was escalated faster than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within weeks, she developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which are conditions that caused her skin to blister and peel. She was put into a medically induced coma for 37 days and woke up with permanent, life-altering injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[I] woke up to a body I did not recognize. I had to completely learn how to walk, eat, swallow, everything all over again," she wrote on a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe page;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;.

She won, and a jury awarded her more than $40 million in damages. But under Georgia’s apportionment law, each defendant is only responsible for the percentage of fault the jury assigns them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A comment on Shaw's TikTok, which she "liked," additionally pointed out that she "got NOTHING from the facility because under GEORGIA LAW they are IMMUNE from liability because they are part of the GOVERNMENT." As the facility was deemed responsible for a large percentage of what happened to her, that effectively meant she could only recover a fraction of the jury's award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw tried appealing the decision, arguing that she should be able to recover the full amount of the jury's award from those she sued. Ultimately, she &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, the "higher courts refused to hear my case. The Supreme Court wouldn't even grant review."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The original lawsuit noted that her medical bills had already reached over &lt;a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/investigations/womans-skin-melts-off-after-medication-error/85-437871972" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$3.45 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$3.45 million&lt;/a&gt; as of 2017.

After legal fees, she said she received an extremely small fraction of what she was awarded, an insult that is exacerbated by the fact that this incident has left her unable to work due to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="mb-4 border-l-2 pl-5 italic text-tertiary"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Frustrated viewers offer support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In recent years, Shaw has been sharing her story on TikTok, drawing attention to flaws in the medical, health insurance, and legal systems in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even just since posting her emotional video on Tuesday, which has racked up over 3.8 million views, she's posted dozens of videos clarifying her situation, explaining nuances about what happened, diving into systemic racism in the medical community, and so much more, with most of her videos drawing tens of thousands of views each in that short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the comments largely reflect support and frustration on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Your rage is SO JUSTIFIED," wrote @bri.stlouiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is the most valid crashout i've ever heard," @jomomma72 agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A number of people also referenced Luigi Mangione, who was charged in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and who has become sort of a dark folk hero among those sick and tired of the way health insurance focuses more on profit than supporting care for people in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is EXACTLY why luigi did what he did," @default.nickname665 claimed.

                &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral bacteria and fungi may help reshape the pancreatic microbiome and promote carcinogenesis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earlier research has connected periodontal disease and clinical candidiasis with greater pancreatic cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altogether, the study identified a more than threefold increase in cancer risk for every one standard deviation rise in a microbial risk score comprised of 27 bacteria and fungi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen bacteria and fungi in the mouth may be linked to pancreatic cancer risk, according to an analysis of two large cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of oral-wash samples from over 120,000 people revealed three bacterial pathogens behind periodontal disease, 21 other bacterial species, and four fungi associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer, said Jiyoung Ahn, PhD, of New York University in New York City, and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A microbial risk score (MRS) that combined 27 bacteria and fungi was linked to a 3.44-fold increase (95% CI 2.63-4.51) in cancer risk for every one standard deviation rise in the MRS, they noted in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377?guestAccessKey=c9b60472-cdd3-4fe3-b05b-d4f24722e2ab&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=091825" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could serve as an important risk-stratification tool in healthy populations," Ahn told &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;. "If validated, oral microbiome profiling could serve as a noninvasive biomarker to identify individuals at elevated risk who might benefit from enhanced surveillance  --  which is especially important given the lack of effective early detection methods for pancreatic cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings strengthen earlier research that already connects periodontal disease, particularly &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; infection, and clinical candidiasis with &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/62/12/1764" target="_blank"&gt;greater pancreatic cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that maintaining good oral hygiene  --  through regular brushing, flossing, and dental care  --  is critical," Ahn added. "This is a modifiable factor for pancreatic cancer prevention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three periodontal disease pathogens were linked to greater pancreatic cancer risk, including &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.57), &lt;em&gt;Eubacterium nodatum&lt;/em&gt; (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76), and &lt;em&gt;Parvimonas micra&lt;/em&gt; (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.70). Also associated with greater risk were six &lt;em&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/em&gt; species, three &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/em&gt; species, three &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt; species, and one &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium&lt;/em&gt; species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased presence of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;, the most common fungal genus, was significantly linked with greater pancreatic cancer risk (1.58-fold, 95% CI 1.05-2.38), including &lt;em&gt;Candida tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; (1.43-fold, 95% CI 1.00-2.03) and unspecified &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; (1.34-fold, 95% CI 1.05-1.70). &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;'s link to pancreatic cancer was stronger in people with a history of tobacco use, but body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, and diabetes didn't boost the association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMI, smoking history, alcohol use, or diabetes also had no substantial effect on the link between the MRS and pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some oral bacteria and fungi were linked with reduced pancreatic cancer risk, including six periodontal disease pathogens and three &lt;em&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/em&gt; species, two &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/em&gt; species, and two &lt;em&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/em&gt; species. Oral fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; (0.77-fold, 95% CI 0.62-0.96) and &lt;em&gt;Malassezia globosa&lt;/em&gt; (0.84-fold, 95% CI 0.73-0.98) were associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Emerging evidence systematically links oral pathogens to pancreatic carcinogenesis, suggesting that poor oral health may be causally related to pancreatic cancer development," Ahn and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathogens such as &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; have been found in pancreatic cancer, and some of the oral bacteria identified in the study are linked with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism dysfunction. When oral microbes migrate from the oral cavity to the pancreas, they may play a role in reshaping the pancreatic microbiome and promoting carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those oral visitors can then help keep cancer going. Their ongoing pancreatic presence can cause "dysbiosis that releases microbial toxins and metabolites, promoting pancreatic tumorigenesis by triggering an innate immune response and thereby affecting phagocytic potential and inflammatory processes," Ahn and colleagues explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected oral wash samples from 70,000 people in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort and 52,000 people in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, 445 people who developed pancreatic cancer over a median of 8.8 years were matched with 445 controls. Of those 890 people, 47% were female, 92% were white, and the average age was 67 years. Those with pancreatic cancer were more likely than controls to smoke, drink alcohol, or have a family history of pancreatic cancer. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the diversity of oral bacteria or overall microbiome composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations included the study's observational design, which could allow confounding by unmeasured factors. Incomplete microbiome reference databases may have limited findings of risk-raising fungi. Finally, the study population's large percentage of white participants may limit the findings' generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publisher Taylor &amp;amp; Francis is investigating concerns raised on PubPeer about a paper claiming to find DNA contamination in COVID-19 vaccines beyond regulators’ recommended amounts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the U.S. body tasked with making recommendations for vaccine use is scheduled to consider the safety of COVID-19 shots, and two of the study’s authors say their findings will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; at issue was published September 6 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity&lt;/em&gt;, a Taylor &amp;amp; Francis title. Scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick soon posted concerns on PubPeer, which he forwarded to the ethics department of the publisher. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-132874"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On September 8, Laura Wilson, Taylor &amp;amp; Francis’ Head of Research Integrity &amp;amp; Ethics, thanked Patrick for raising the concerns and said the company would “investigate in accordance with the COPE guidelines and our Editorial policies.”    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The publisher added a pop-up notification to the article to alert readers to the ongoing investigation after we asked if they would do so. Taylor &amp;amp; Francis &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/25/publisher-adds-temporary-online-notifications-to-articles-under-investigation/"&gt;began using such notices&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jennifer McMillan, a spokesperson for Taylor &amp;amp; Francis, confirmed the publisher’s Ethics and Integrity team “are aware of the comments made on PubPeer and are investigating the article in question.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the investigation is in its very early stages we cannot make any further comment,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paolo Casali, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/iaut20/about-this-journal#editorial-board"&gt;editor-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity&lt;/em&gt;, did not respond to our request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On September 19, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will include presentations on “COVID-19 vaccine safety.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi"&gt;Retsef Levi&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge and chair of the ACIP &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/our-work/index.html#heading-uuf6nwjsay"&gt;work group&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 vaccines, will introduce the session. The work group’s activities include reviewing and summarizing “gaps in the existing knowledge regarding potential impurities (e.g., DNA contamination and endotoxins) in existing immunization products and their health impacts to inform immunization recommendations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study coauthor Kevin McKernan of the Beverly, Mass.-based company Medicinal Genomics said in &lt;a href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/dna-contamination-entered-into-the"&gt;a Sept. 14 post&lt;/a&gt; on Substack he had been “contacted by the ACIP committee to go over our paper.” A &lt;a href="https://x.com/JesslovesMJK/status/1965925999968919815"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; by another coauthor, independent researcher Jessica Rose, stated the committee will be considering their paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her own Substack &lt;a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/new-published-study-shows-theres"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, Rose wrote Senator Ron Johnson (R – Wisconsin) had submitted the study as evidence in a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations September 9. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also included a prediction: “they will try to retract our work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;The authors of the paper — Rose, McKernan, and David J. Speicher of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada — describe using two different methods to measure the amount of DNA remaining in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna due to their &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Production"&gt;manufacturing processes&lt;/a&gt;. Speicher, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McKernan was also an author on a July &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202507.2155/v1"&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; about “Synthetic mRNA Vaccines and Transcriptomic Dysregulation” that was withdrawn on Sept. 11 after sleuths &lt;a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2025/07/25/preprint-claiming-that-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cause-transcriptomic-dysregulation-is-deeply-flawed/"&gt;Elisabeth Bik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/07/28/no-mrna-vaccines-do-not-cause-transcriptomic-chaos/"&gt;Reese Richardson&lt;/a&gt; documented problems with the manuscript. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using one method, fluorometry, the authors of the &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity &lt;/em&gt;paper said they found amounts of DNA in all their samples of various vaccine lots that were higher than guidelines from the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/characterization-and-qualification-cell-substrates-and-other-biological-materials-used-production"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/biologicals/documents/trs_978_annex_3.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; recommend. Using the other method, qPCR, they said three samples were over the limit.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On PubPeer, Patrick, who uses the pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis,” &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#1"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the regulators’ recommendations were set for qPCR tests, not fluorometry. “Applying that regulatory threshold to fluorometry values is misleading, since regulators do not recognize fluorometry as the standard,” he wrote. Fluorometry also picks up mRNA, &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/addressing-misinformation-about-excessive-dna-mrna-vaccines"&gt;according to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt;, so it does not correctly measure DNA amounts in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In subsequent comments, Patrick also &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#2"&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; the authors’ &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/16/exclusive-journal-bans-drug-safety-database-papers-as-they-flood-the-literature/"&gt;use of data&lt;/a&gt; from the FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and the appropriateness of several of the documents the authors cited. One &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517#references-Section1"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; consisted of &lt;a href="https://www.porthedland.wa.gov.au/council-meetings/special-council-meetings/special-council-meeting-11-october-2024/247/documents/attachments_scm_11102024.pdf"&gt;the attachments&lt;/a&gt; to a meeting agenda for the town council of Port Hedland, Australia, which included a report referencing a 2023 preprint from the paper’s coauthors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the questionable references Patrick identified, Retraction Watch found the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/chemistry-manufacturing-and-control-cmc-information-human-gene-therapy-investigational-new-drug"&gt;FDA guidance&lt;/a&gt; the researchers cited was issued for gene therapies, and explicitly stated it “does not apply to vaccines for infectious disease indications.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other commenters on PubPeer added technical critiques of the paper as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how this paper could have made it through peer review,” Patrick told us. “Sadly, we almost never find out what happens behind the scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers to the federal government – now embroiled in controversy under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr – kicked off a two-day meeting with a debate over proposed changes to the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In years past, the gathering of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, would typically draw little interest from the broader public, but the panel that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/acip-charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;provides guidance&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines should be used has come under intense scrutiny as of late.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is the group's second meeting since Kennedy Jr. scrapped the existing panel of experts installed under the Biden administration and replaced them with an entirely new roster, including five members &lt;a href="http://advisers" target="_blank"&gt;he added just this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The meeting began with pointed comments from Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who is serving as the committee&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/Final-posted-2025-06-24-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; chair&lt;/a&gt;, against critics –– among them a slate of former CDC directors &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;who have said&lt;/a&gt; the new members, selected by Secretary Kennedy, are "unqualified" and "share his dangerous and unscientific views. "&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorf rebuffed the idea that he or others on the panel were "anti-vaxxers" and challenged the former directors to an "open public debate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If they want to be trusted, they should all accept," he said, "The fact is we are honest vaccine scientists that let the data speak, whether the results go in one direction or the other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel devoted the morning to a discussion of whether to overhaul existing CDC recommendations that allow children under age 4 to receive a combination shot for measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (or varicella), the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of children in the U.S. – about 85% – get separate shots for MMR and chickenpox, though parents currently have the option to give their children the single shot to cover all four diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CDC staff presented evidence showing a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures in children ages 12-23 months associated with the MMRV shot compared to the MMR, which concerned some committee members.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I would go with the option that seems to be safer," said ACIP member Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But several physicians on the panel and representatives from major medical associations in attendance balked at the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and professor at Dartmouth College and ACIP member, said while "frightening" for the family, these &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522" target="_blank"&gt;fever-related seizures&lt;/a&gt; are not uncommon, occurring in 3 to 5% of all children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every pediatrician is experienced in febrile seizures. We know that the prognosis is excellent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Removing the MMRV shots from the vaccine schedule for children under age 4 would spark more public confusion, compromise insurance coverage and potentially lead to fewer kids being vaccinated, said &lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/who-we-are-what-we-do/leadership/boards-committees-councils/immunization-subcommittee" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, president of the American College of Physicians who is acting as a liaison to the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most children get the chickenpox vaccine as a separate shot, some parents might prefer to reduce the number of jabs, even if the combination carries some risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I urge this committee not to change the recommendations if they truly want to give the power to the parents to decide what is best for their child," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meissner said of the recommendation against the combination vaccine: "What we're saying is we don't trust parents," adding "I prefer that families have the option to make the selection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel's recommendations determine which shots are offered for free through the Vaccines for Children program. They also influence what many health insurers must cover.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting comes on the heels of a contentious Senate hearing on Wednesday with the recently-ousted CDC director Susan Monarez.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Monarez testified that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;she was fired after clashing&lt;/a&gt; with Kennedy over his demands that she preemptively agree to approve vaccine recommendations from ACIP, and fire career scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He said the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September and that I needed to be on board with it," Monarez said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kulldorf criticized Monarez and several other high-level CDC officials who recently resigned in protest of changes at the agency, saying they had not reached out to him, despite their concerns about the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The absence of a liaison from the American Academy of Pediatrics – the leading national group representing pediatricians in the U.S. that would usually collaborate with the panel – was another sign of the increasingly polarized nature of vaccine policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The AAP had decided to boycott the meetings, &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32529/AAP-will-continue-to-publish-its-own-vaccine?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;arguing federal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policymaking is no longer a "credible process."

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdu001h3b790103ccp9@published"&gt;Society has a remarkable love-hate relationship with artificial sweeteners. Originally marketed as a miracle—enjoy your favorite foods without the nasty sugar!—they’re now the target of wellness influencers across the internet. It’s not just health “coaches” and homesteading moms leading the charge: This year’s &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/06/rfk-jr-maha-report-kids-health-chronic-illness-medication.html"&gt;deeply problematic Make America Healthy Again report&lt;/a&gt; singles out artificial sweeteners as one of the major issues with American food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001i3b79bd2uef6d@published"&gt;Recent headlines seem to support this belief. According to dozens of articles, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/sweeteners-can-harm-cognitive-health-equivalent-to-16-years-of-ageing-study-finds#:~:text=Sweeteners%20can%20harm%20cognitive%20health,years%20of%20ageing%2C%20study%20finds&amp;amp;text=Food,The%20Guardian"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/your-daily-diet-soda-could-aging-your-brain-faster-than-you-think-study-finds"&gt;harming our cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;. The news sounds scary for those of us who &lt;a href="https://x.com/danielcrosby/status/1534584565431296001?lang=en"&gt;enjoy the occasional artificially sweetened soda&lt;/a&gt;, let alone the (many) people who consider a can of Diet Coke to be a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DietCoke/status/1362846917277986816"&gt;personal accessory&lt;/a&gt;. What if these chemicals really are destroying our neurons?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001j3b79nwyghpoi@published"&gt;Fortunately for those of you who, like me, enjoy a regular can of Pepsi Zero Sugar, the data is extremely weak. Artificial sweeteners are probably fine for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001k3b79f38f43ha@published"&gt;These alarmist headlines are based on a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023#xd_co_f=NTE5M2Q4MTUtODk5Yi00YWIxLWFmYmUtMmFiMWQ1ZGVjYjFh~"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes a medium-sized cohort of Brazilian public servants. People were asked once about the foods that they ate and then followed up with for about a decade, and then the authors looked at the association between various sweeteners and later cognitive health. Basically, they looked to see if the people who ate more sweeteners had worse brain function over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001l3b79riorbrpd@published"&gt;The results were pretty unimpressive. In the entire sample of people, there was no significant relationship between the sweeteners in the study and cognitive health. For people under 60, there were some declines in memory associated with more sweeteners, but no such findings for people over 60. There were also very mixed results: Two measures of cognitive decline showed some associations with sweeteners, but another test had different results.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001m3b79swl4es49@published"&gt;In addition, the reductions in cognitive health for the under-60 group were mostly very small. People who ate the most sweeteners—which in this case was up to 200 times as much as people who ate the least—lost about half a point more on a 30-point scale over the decade of the study. That’s not nothing, but with such a huge difference in intake, it’s remarkable that the difference in cognitive issues was so small. (Would you rather: Give up Diet Coke, or forget, say, your college roommate’s stepdad’s name 10 years down the line?)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001n3b79e5jfglfr@published"&gt;This study was also observational, which &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/research-coffee-health-benefits-skeptical.html"&gt;regular readers know&lt;/a&gt; introduces all sorts of issues. In this case, that means that the authors were just testing correlations rather than looking at whether one thing caused another. There are all sorts of issues that could have messed up the results that an observational study can’t control for. It’s not easy to remember what you ate for lunch last Wednesday, and there’s really only so much you can do with an analysis looking at what foods people &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; they eat. People are notoriously terrible at answering this sort of questionnaire, and often get large parts of them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001o3b79erpokkxl@published"&gt;It’s also very hard to take a food-frequency questionnaire and identify specific additives in people’s diets. You have to make some sort of estimate based on what you think the products that they eat are likely to contain, but those guesses are always going to have holes. (Brazilian commenters online have noted that tagatose, one of the sweeteners included in the study, is actually a type of sugar and is also &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jcsouto.bsky.social/post/3ly62vkomtc2x"&gt;not used at all in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001p3b7938pb933e@published"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, the idea that this blend of sweeteners is harming cognitive health is hard to understand. The list of sweeteners that the study analyzed together includes &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sophieehill.bsky.social/post/3ly44c5o5xs2z"&gt;vastly different chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, all of which break down into different things inside our body. These likely wouldn’t all impact cognitive health in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001q3b79e90n67kv@published"&gt;It’s easy to see why these headlines draw us in: There’s so much conflicting information out there about what’s “healthy” and what isn’t. Nutritional epidemiology has had some very interesting findings, but there is very little that this sort of study can really tell us about what you should have in your diet. If I’m being generous, it’s an interesting prompt for further research. More realistically, it’s just a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001r3b79x2cis1xg@published"&gt;We already knew that people who drink and eat artificial sweeteners are generally worse off than people who don’t. That’s no surprise—the main reason we use these additives is to lose weight. Generally, people who want to lose weight are a bit less healthy than people who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001s3b7929rolawx@published"&gt;My verdict: There’s no good evidence that these sweeteners are harming your brain. My advice is always to drink water if you’re really worried, but this new data certainly won’t stop me from popping open a can of Pepsi &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;Max.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve probably seen it touted by celebrities and fitness influencers as a natural sports hydrator and a cure-all elixir. But is coconut water good for you, or is it just another passing trend? As a registered dietitian, my job is to look past the marketing claims and dive into the science, helping people understand what they are putting into their bodies and how it affects their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we dive in, let’s clarify what coconut water actually is. Harvested from the center of young, green coconuts, this clear, slightly sweet liquid is naturally low in calories, fat-free, and rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Often confused for coconut milk (a popular &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a45322121/expert-approved-vegan-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegan milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vegan milk&lt;/a&gt; option), but the two are quite different. Coconut water is the natural liquid found inside young coconuts, while coconut milk is made by blending the grated meat of mature coconuts with water, resulting in a thicker, creamier, and higher-calorie liquid. Coconut water, on the other hand, is light, refreshing, and widely celebrated for its hydrating properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, find the science-backed benefits and limitations of coconut water to help you decide if it’s worth adding to your daily routine. From hydration to heart health, we’ll uncover what this tropical drink truly offers, and where its claims fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coconut water nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nutrition information varies by brand, 8 oz of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fproducts%2F18423613-vita-coco-coconut-water-pure-199-8-fl-oz&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66069005%2Fis-coconut-water-good-for-your-health%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vita Coco’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Vita Coco’s&lt;/a&gt; original flavor contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 45.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total sugars: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugars 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium: 38 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium: 470 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium: 18 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of coconut water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water’s primary strength lies in its unique nutritional profile. It’s more than just flavored water (with no artificial ingredients!); it’s a source of key minerals that play important roles in our bodies. Here are some of the science-backed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent for hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known claims about coconut water is its ability to hydrate, and this one is largely true. Proper hydration is essential for everything from organ function to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9993798/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive performance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water is about 95% water, making it inherently hydrating. But its real advantage comes from its electrolyte content, particularly potassium, sodium, and magnesium. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a21085214/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; are minerals that are crucial for maintaining fluid balance in the body. When we sweat, especially during intense exercise or in hot weather, we lose both water and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing lost minerals is key to effective rehydration. While research on whether coconut water is more effective than plain water for rehydration &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27768399/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is conflicting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is well established that electrolytes, such as potassium and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65893243/types-of-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465972/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are important;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are important&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water offers a natural way to replenish fluids and electrolytes without the high sugar content or artificial additives found in many commercial sports drinks. For the average person engaging in moderate exercise, it can be a refreshing and healthier alternative. However, for elite athletes involved in prolonged and intense training, a specialized sports drink with higher levels of carbohydrates and sodium may still be the better option for optimal recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A source of potassium, which helps heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in their diets, which is a concern because this mineral is vital for several bodily functions, including helping manage blood pressure and supporting heart health. Coconut water is a&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/174831/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural source of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; natural source of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with a single cup containing more potassium than a medium banana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium plays a key role in balancing sodium levels in the body. A diet high in sodium can lead to elevated blood pressure, but getting enough potassium &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37091649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may help lower it. Research supports the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure#:~:text=Potassium%20can%20reduce%20the%20effects,also%20helps%20lower%20blood%20pressure." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:link between adequate potassium intake and healthier blood pressure levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;link between adequate potassium intake and healthier blood pressure levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Including potassium-rich sources like coconut water can be a simple and refreshing way to help meet your daily needs and support your cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies constantly manage oxidative stress caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals. This stress can damage cells and is linked to chronic diseases and aging. Antioxidants are compounds that help neutralize these free radicals. Coconut water contains antioxidants that may help protect your body from this damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research on the specific antioxidant effects of coconut water in humans is still emerging, studies have confirmed the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39759299/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presence of these beneficial compounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presence of these beneficial compounds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Including a variety of antioxidant-rich foods and beverages in your diet is a cornerstone of good health, and coconut water can be a part of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help with ulcerative colitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has anti-inflammatory properties, and reducing inflammation is key to managing &lt;a href="http://www.prevention.com/ulcerativev-colitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt; (UC). &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(24)00088-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study showed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study showed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what happened when researchers investigated whether adding coconut water to standard medical treatment could benefit patients with mild to moderate UC. In this study, 95 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to either consume coconut water daily for eight weeks alongside their usual treatment, while the other group received a placebo drink with their treatment. The results showed that coconut water was linked to improved outcomes compared to the placebo, including that more patients in the coconut water group achieved remission and showed significant symptom improvement. Coconut water also appeared to be linked to an increase in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, which was linked to better symptom control and reduced inflammation. More research is needed on the subject, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should not drink coconut water?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is often praised for its health benefits, it’s not without potential risks, and it may not be suitable for everyone. One key consideration is its natural sugar content. Although it’s lower in sugar than many sports drinks or sodas, coconut water still contains natural sugars that can impact blood sugar levels. This makes it important for people with diabetes or those managing blood sugar levels to consume it in moderation and monitor their response. Additionally, coconut water is high in potassium, which is generally beneficial for most people but can pose risks for individuals with kidney disease or those on medications that affect potassium levels, such as certain blood pressure drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water may also not be the best choice for those who need to limit their calorie intake, as it contains more calories than plain water. Athletes or individuals using it for hydration should also be aware that it may not provide enough sodium to replace what’s lost through heavy sweating, making it less effective than some sports drinks for intense or prolonged exercise. Additionally, people with nut allergies should consult a healthcare provider before consuming coconut water, as some may have sensitivities to coconut. Overall, while coconut water can be a healthy and refreshing drink for many, it’s important to consider individual health conditions and consume it in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is coconut water good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? The answer is a resounding yes, with a few considerations. It is a naturally hydrating beverage packed with electrolytes like potassium, which can support hydration, heart health, and more. Its antioxidant content adds another layer of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s crucial to choose the right kind. Always opt for 100% pure, unsweetened coconut water. Many brands add sugar or fruit juices, which can quickly turn a healthy drink into a sugary one, adding unnecessary calories and negating many of the health benefits.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm36x000f3b79k2efihao@published"&gt;My sister “Charlotte” is getting married soon, and the wedding is in the city where I live. Our parents want to stay with Aiden and me—and my mom has a shocking stipulation about where Aiden should sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnnhbr000r3b79j7y078o2@published"&gt;My mother insists that Aiden can stay with friends or at a motel! The reason? They want to visit with their dogs, and Aiden is severely allergic to dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnqt35000y3b79ieespion@published"&gt;Even if I were willing to entertain this idea (which I am not), the entire house would have to be cleaned after the dogs left, and even then there would be no guarantee that Aiden’s allergies wouldn’t be triggered. It’s not a risk I’m willing to expose him to. My mother has never been fond of my husband “Aiden,” but this request is beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ao000g3b79sn4z02jw@published"&gt;When I explained to my parents that they needed to make other arrangements, they threatened not to come to Charlotte’s wedding at all. Now my sister has joined my parents in insisting that Aiden stay elsewhere (she and her fiance have even offered to let him stay at their place), adding that her wedding will be ruined if our parents aren’t there and it will be my fault. This is all so upsetting that&lt;em&gt; I’m &lt;/em&gt;considering not attending the wedding. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3dt000h3b799jmwczxo@published"&gt;—Not a Hotel&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3i2000j3b79i20elhio@published"&gt;Of course your parents should be at your sister’s wedding. But it is up to them—not you!—to figure out what to do with their dogs.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3k5000k3b79pnien8uh@published"&gt;As someone with a sensitive dog who can’t really be boarded, I sympathize with the hassle (to a point). There are plenty of good pet sitters out there—your parents can search for reputable local pet sitting businesses, ask their friends for recommendations, or try Rover.com. Pet-friendly hotels and Airbnbs also exist. And if your sister and her fiance were willing to let your husband stay at their place, they should also be willing to host your parents, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3mj000l3b79g0uoot63@published"&gt;Your family should be able to understand that you don’t want to see your husband displaced from his home, only to return and possibly have a serious allergic reaction to lingering pet dander. I think you’ve already done about all you can to explain this to them. Let them know that as far as you’re concerned, the conversation is over; if they try to pull you back into it, don’t engage. Your parents’ dogs are not your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ok000m3b792cldk8jt@published"&gt;As for whether to attend your sister’s wedding, only you can make that call. If you don’t go, it could lead to a larger and more lasting rift in the family, which they might also blame you for. But they’re already blaming you for the current drama—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you mentioned that your mother has never liked your husband—so maybe those are consequences you can live with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnikyc000lczj81szwnbvv@published"&gt;My husband and I frequently disagree about treating our daughter’s various childhood ailments. He immediately rushes to our pediatrician for antibiotics and sees nothing wrong with daily over-the-counter allergy medicine as a preventative, even when she’s not symptomatic. I tend towards a wait-and-see approach with minimal medical intervention. While I am not into the essential oil craze of my peers, I prefer healthy foods, saline nose sprays, teas, and other methods of easing common ear/nose/throat symptoms, with a doctor called in only for severe or prolonged symptoms. The kicker is that my husband is the stay-at-home parent and usually makes the medical decisions. I would prefer our daughter not become antibiotic-resistant because of overuse. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/08/parenting-advice-on-disagreements-about-health-care-for-kids.html"&gt;How can we resolve our different approaches to our child’s health?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any kind of exercise is good for your health, from simple things such walking—which is also &lt;a href="https://mymodernmet.com/walking-nature-reduce-negative-feelings/"&gt;great for your mental health&lt;/a&gt;—to more specialized activities such as powerlifting. But if you usually suffer from poor sleep, scientists seem to have found a great antidote for it in one particular type of workout. And while they all are likely to help as they tire you out, one excels at helping you rest, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the Harbin Sport University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desktop-blog-ad desktop-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at 30 randomized controlled trials from a dozen countries. The data featured 2,500 participants of all ages, all of them with some kind of sleep issue. The test subjects reported their experience with different activities, such as resistance training, aerobics, or traditional Chinese exercises, like &lt;em&gt;qi gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tai chi&lt;/em&gt;. However, one offered the best results overall—high-intensity yoga. The best part? All it required was practicing it for less than 30 minutes twice a week, with results becoming noticeable after about eight to 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an interesting find, the team knows there are a lot of fine details to this discovery. “Reasonable exercise intervention can effectively improve sleep disorders, but the best combination of exercise prescription variables is not yet clear,” write the researchers. “Further, high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings due to the limited studies included.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yoga is not your thing, a &lt;a href="https://fmch.bmj.com/content/13/1/e003056" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, points to resistance and strength training as the most effective to help you sleep, as they found it can improve participants’ sleep by 35% more than aerobic exercise. However, keeping healthy sleep habits seemed to be better at ensuring a good rest rather than the exercise itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists also recommend paying attention at the timing of your exercise. For example, aerobic exercise causes the body to release endorphins, which can put your brain in an active mode that may keep you awake. That’s why you should exercise at least one to two hours before going to bed, to give your body time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have solid evidence that exercise does, in fact, help you fall asleep more quickly and improves sleep quality,” Dr. Charlene Gamaldo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins Medicine. “But there’s still some debate as to what time of day you should exercise. I encourage people to listen to their bodies to see how well they sleep in response to when they work out.”

On Tuesday, the first two patients to recover were discharged, the WHO chief revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that was first discovered in Africa in the 1970s.

It can persist in survivors’ bodies, sometimes re-emerging years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2014 and 2016, three countries in West Africa – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – experienced the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record, with the disease killing more than 11,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 16:31:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQNndLc0tBS3lqdDkyR2NzZWxtdldCbk91RTV4VEg2dFRfejZKeTJTLUhEbzVka0pSb3RwRlBfeEd1M0xSVERLN05GRUlRb1RqS08zNGpTTGhoeHdYV2xHazIzQkI1YTBHMjVfZV9fZWRsX0dUaDdOU1ZQNVJ0cVNrWjlqTEotaFVvaVHSAY8BQVVfeXFMTTlRTENuV2VrYXhIWm45a2VGR2Ixc3VJOE5iel9MSXlwSDFQZnZpcUF3N0lhU2ttN0U5NVNRYnZlS1g1bXRLaF85LVpINHQtWWdQS19qdEhXMTNoVDZlQm5SbWoxaHg3SGE0S2cwcVFCTDNQTXVRRVNiWEFRLW9tdkZweVVEcm0tdVpBRklfMzg</guid></item><item><title>发现有效预防皮肤癌的膳食补充剂- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-dietary-supplement-effective-skin-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietary supplement nicotinamide has been recommended by dermatologists for people with a history of skin cancer since 2015, when a clinical study with 386 participants showed that those who took the vitamin B3 derivative developed fewer new occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;However, data to validate those findings in a larger study group has been lacking because nicotinamide can be purchased over the counter without being entered into patients' medical records. In a new study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2838591" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Sept. 17 in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers found a way to get that data by analyzing records from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide is on the VA's official formulary, so the researchers checked the outcomes of 33,833 patients for their next skin &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis following baseline &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; with 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice daily for longer than 30 days. They looked for occurrences of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared 12,287 patients who received the treatment with 21,479 who did not. Overall, there was a 14% reduction in skin cancer risk. When nicotinamide was taken after a first skin cancer, the risk reduction rose to 54%, but the benefit declined with treatment initiation following subsequent skin cancers. The risk reduction was much larger for squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population. These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier. We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit, as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers," said the study's corresponding author, Lee Wheless, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology and Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a staff physician at VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to ascertain the outcomes of 1,334 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; who were immunocompromised due to having received solid organ transplants. Among solid organ transplant recipients, no overall significant risk reduction was observed, although early &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide&lt;/a&gt; use was associated with reduced occurrences of cutaneous squamous cell &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carcinoma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Fewer Americans say they &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt; now than they have done for decades, but for those that do, the habit appears to have become dramatically deadlier over time, with the alcohol-related death rate in the U.S. almost doubling in the last twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find that the rate of alcohol-related death increased between 1999 and 2024, with an especially sharp uptick during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. And while such deaths have declined since that peak, they remain markedly high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted policies to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and improve access to treatment,” the authors write in a paper &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0004623"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A shocking rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new findings jibe with past studies that also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alcohol-is-killing-more-americans-than-ever-1840862638"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; alcohol-related deaths in America have been climbing for decades. But it remained unclear as to the specific kinds of deaths caused by alcohol, or whether the increase in deadly drinking seen during the pandemic has been sustained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try and tease apart the answers to those questions, the researchers analyzed mortality data from the CDC across 14 causes of death induced by alcohol use. These included alcoholic liver disease, several forms of alcohol poisoning, as well as mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the rate of alcohol-related deaths rose 89% between 1999 and 2024, the researchers found. The single deadliest year during this period was 2021, which saw 54,258 reported deaths that year. By 2024, deaths had begun to level off, but the average alcohol-induced death rate was still 25% higher than it was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Trends in deadly drinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings also offer more clarity on who is dying from alcohol misuse, and why, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of alcohol-related deaths were caused by alcoholic liver disease, followed by mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol. Interestingly, the rate of alcohol poisoning deaths remained low throughout the study period, indicating that acute overdoses are relatively uncommon compared to chronic and heavy alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcohol-related deaths have historically been more common among men, but the researchers’ findings suggest that may be changing: They found that the single largest increase in the death rate of any demographic during the study period was among women aged 25–34, followed by men in the same age group. American Indian and Alaskan Native populations were also found to be at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The rapid rise of alcohol-induced deaths among women is particularly concerning. Although men still die at higher rates, the gender gap appears to be closing,” said senior study author Maria R. D’Orsogna, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-analysis-alcohol-deaths.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Notably, for the population aged 25–34, the male-to-female mortality ratio has decreased from three-to-one in 1999 to two-to-one in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that they looked at deaths most directly tied to alcohol use, so their findings likely do not capture the full toll of alcohol on Americans’ health. Alcohol is known to raise the risk or worsen myriad chronic health conditions, including certain cancers. And other research has &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics-z/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-related-emergencies-and-deaths-united-states#:~:text=The%20Alcohol%2DRelated%20Disease%20Impact,States%2C%20behind%20tobacco%2C%20poor%20diet"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that more than 178,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to excessive alcohol use occur every year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out how best to prevent these deaths, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise in alcohol-induced mortality and its heterogeneous trends across demographics highlight the need for a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors linked to excessive alcohol consumption and of targeted prevention and treatment efforts, particularly for males, youth, and the [American Indian/Alaska Native] population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is (what else) a Golden Retriever named Chloe, and she was over the moon when Mom surprised her with the stuffie.

From spotting the treasure at the store to setting it up for Chloe to find, this video checks all the boxes for your daily dose of sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1-year-old pup was so thrilled about her identical twin &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-brilliantly-macgyvers-stuffie-from-sleeping-sibling" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stuffie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stuffie&lt;/a&gt;, she couldn't wait another second to get to business (playing).

"My Retriever loves hers," another shared. "It is honestly my dog's baby," another posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom replied in the comments with a much-needed update, writing Chloe "absolutely destroyed and destuffed it within a few hours." Well, at least they had a good run!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe's just a happy girl who loves having fun.

            As a group of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/health/five-things-to-watch-acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting"&gt;meets to make recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on who should get the updated Covid-19 shot this season, a newly published analysis from dozens of researchers emphasizes the “substantial” benefits of broad vaccine recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00043b6nta9lb2us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration has already made significant changes to this season’s shots: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/covid-vaccines-fda"&gt;limiting approval&lt;/a&gt; to adults 65 and older, and younger people who are at higher risk from Covid-19. The forthcoming vote from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, carries additional implications for vaccine access – and there are signs that the group could restrict access even further.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00053b6nrj9xrwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But scientific projection models from nine teams of researchers, summarized in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.32469&amp;amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2025.32469" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, show that sticking to a universal Covid-19 vaccine recommendation – as has been in place in the US in recent years – has the potential to save thousands more lives than limiting the recommendation to high-risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00063b6ng3s36xhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While focusing on vaccination among individuals at the highest risk for severe outcomes, including those aged 65 and older and those with comorbidities, remains an effective ongoing strategy, our scenario projections demonstrate that maintaining the recommendation for all individuals to receive reformulated vaccines has the potential to save thousands more lives through both direct and indirect effects,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00073b6nfdz5js66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub&lt;/a&gt; has provided nearly 20 rounds of projections estimating Covid-19 disease burden. Various teams build their models with a unique set of assumptions, which are then combined into ensemble projections for six scenarios based on different vaccine recommendations and viral immune escape — vulnerability to things like a new variant or waning immunity from prior infection or vaccination. The group’s work was used to guide the expansion of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00215-0/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;primary COVID-19 vaccine schedule to school-age children&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7129e1.htm?s_cid=mm7129e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;booster recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00083b6nilxhkhn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models for last season – covering the period from April 2024 to April 2025 – included a worst-case scenario where there was no vaccine recommendation and high immune escape, and a best-case scenario where there was a universal vaccine recommendation and low immune escape.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00093b6nna8o32ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scenario that the researchers say was most similar to the way last season actually played out involved high immune escape. The universal vaccine recommendation that was in place in this scenario was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 11% and deaths by 13% – essentially averting 104,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000a3b6np8pwhs1v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccine recommendations had been limited to high-risk individuals, the benefit of the vaccine would still be substantial: an 8% reduction in hospitalizations and 10% reduction in deaths. But the expanded recommendations for all ages was projected to prevent an additional 28,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths, the study showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000b3b6np74cck8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults ages 65 and older benefit the most under all vaccine scenarios, both directly and indirectly. A universal vaccine recommendation would reduce the burden of Covid-19 on seniors by an additional 3 to 4%, averting about 11,000 hospitalizations  and 1,000 deaths in this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000c3b6nbuc19etf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This finding suggests substantial indirect benefits of universal vaccination and the continued value of broad vaccine recommendations,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000d3b6nse0xxfeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The projections for last season were first published by the Scenario Modeling Hub in June 2024, to help inform decision-making ahead of last year’s ACIP meeting. Actual epidemiological trends differed from assumptions that were made in the models at that time – burden was greater than expected during the summer and less in the winter – but projected deaths aligned closely with the models, creating confidence in the “robust accuracy” of the models among the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000e3b6nnxvyy3xu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Projections for &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this season&lt;/a&gt;, published by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub in June, paint a similar picture to last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000f3b6ni2p71cce@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recommending updated Covid-19 vaccines only for high-risk individuals will help to avoid an estimated 90,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths – but broadening the recommendation for all people in the US would save an additional 1,000 lives and prevent an additional 26,000 hospitalizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000g3b6n728jzlet@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We expect continued substantial burden of disease from COVID-19 in the US,” the researchers wrote in an executive summary of the findings. “All vaccination strategies are projected to significantly reduce disease burden. The greatest benefits will be seen if vaccines are offered to all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphuvci00003b6nlv0bnwl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All work by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub is public and “available for consideration” by ACIP and other experts, said Dr. Justin Lessler, a leader with the modeling hub and professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphv52n00023b6n5uslhzsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The modeling work was not presented at ACIP’s June meeting this year and there’s “no indication” that it will presented at this week’s meeting, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpi2uif00053b6niie22wzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We continue to share our results with the CDC and are working to make them more easily available to a broader range of organizations who are providing vaccine guidance,” Lessler said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

These included emotional eating, where a person&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14043751/food-beverages-voters-stress-eat-drink-2024-presidential-election.html"&gt; eats in response to negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;; external eating, or eating because a food looks good rather than hunger; and restrained eating, or controlling diet to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-bbce0c50-93fc-11f0-984f-75cae465fdc7"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that all participants experienced weight loss and drops in vital health markers like cholesterol and A1C, which measures the amount of glucose in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants also initially were less likely to emotionally eat. But after a year, emotional eaters generally went back to their old behaviors, hampering their weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eaters, however, continued cutting back on the practice throughout the experiment, suggesting Ozempic and similar drugs may be more beneficial for external eaters than emotional eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why emotional eaters were more likely to rebound, but they suggested it may be because their behavior is rooted in deeper psychological issues like depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Japan found that people who tend to 'emotionally eat' benefitted less from GLP-1 medications like Ozempic (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Daisuke Yabe, senior study author and professor of medicine at Kyoto University in Japan, said:  'Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1744#:~:text=5.,prevention%20and%20chronic%20disease%20prevention."&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; estimates about one in five Americans reports emotionally eating 'often or very often' due to stress or other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/clinical-diabetes-and-healthcare/articles/10.3389/fcdhc.2025.1638681/full"&gt;Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 92 Japanese adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 58, and just over half of participants were men. They had lived with type 2 diabetes for an average of 12 years, and their average body mass index (BMI) was 30, which is considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 40 percent were given oral semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, while 32 received the injectable form of the drug. Another 12 percent took dulaglutide, found in the weight loss drug Trulicity, and eight percent took liraglutide, which is in Victoza and Saxenda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers followed up with participants at the start of the study, as well as after three months and one year, assessing weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood sugar (glucose), cholesterol and triglycerides, fats stored in the body's cells and used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also given questionnaires on their eating habits and put into groups based on emotional, external and restrained eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows changes in emotional, restraint and external eating at baseline, three months and 12 months. Higher scores indicate increases in the associated behaviors, while lower scores indicate decreases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers suggested people who emotionally eat may have underlying mental health issues that need to be addressed before Ozempic can properly work (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the three-month mark, the researchers found participants reported more restrained eating behaviors and fewer behaviors associated with emotional or external eating. But by the 12-month mark, restrained and emotional eating behaviors returned to their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eating, however, continued to decrease over the year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests people who tended to practice emotional eating were more likely to return to the unhealthy habit than those who practice external eating, resulting in less weight loss over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takehiro Kato, second study author and professor at Gifu University in Japan, said: 'One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the small sample size. The researchers also emphasized that the study shows associations between emotional eating and the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists rather than direct causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the team noted the findings could spark future research looking at the psychological barriers reducing the effectiveness of drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Yabe said: 'While our study suggests a potential association between external eating behavior and treatment response to GLP-1 receptor agonists, these findings remain preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further evidence is necessary before they can be implemented in clinical practice. Should future large-scale or randomized controlled trials validate this relationship, incorporating simple behavioral assessments could become a valuable component in optimizing treatment strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:14:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQUXdoVjQxOE9FQ3hrc29FTTZSeTRTT0lXMnlTZmMyOWdZb1FXaXNVU2g0SHg5UlhnZ3VoZ0RNRlE1TkExNlBNakFIQmNzR1p0RHpEV2dOSmFxaWpQSE1NRkFUOW0wME9tcVlOX1dkR3pHNTJVMkxDVlhiSFFlZEpKSW85UG92RXlvbFdFWEZnTjRRWHZiTjJGTWxDRDDSAaIBQVVfeXFMTjc2S05vM2Z4aC13aU92TTM1emZieHltNFp6UGxsS3dFZUhxUGNwTGltMEExSEgtR0RJeENiZzV2TE9sajlwZ2MwRnNDQS1EdUotYkpOQU13ZTJRZUs1M29IbG82YUkyVmd0ejlDNFowMUVnUm8wNWo1dkp5MElvSlBtS09LYWhmWTlyekRwV2tjTGtBS25MYThNZlZrWkYwY1pB</guid></item><item><title>性格特质意味着Ozempic不适合你……你有吗？ --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15108587/emotional-eating-ozempic-not-work-study.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emotional eaters may see fewer results from blockbuster weight loss drugs like Ozempic, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-bbd36380-93fc-11f0-984f-75cae465fdc7"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; tracked nearly 100 people with type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-bbcc5ea0-93fc-11f0-984f-75cae465fdc7"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; over the course of their first year taking GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At three different points they collected data on the patients' weight, diet and blood markers like glucose and cholesterol, as well as asking about their relationship with food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then divided participants into three groups based on their eating behaviors.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Daisuke Yabe, senior study author and professor of medicine at Kyoto University in Japan, said:  'Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1744#:~:text=5.,prevention%20and%20chronic%20disease%20prevention."&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; estimates about one in five Americans reports emotionally eating 'often or very often' due to stress or other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/clinical-diabetes-and-healthcare/articles/10.3389/fcdhc.2025.1638681/full"&gt;Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 92 Japanese adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 58, and just over half of participants were men. They had lived with type 2 diabetes for an average of 12 years, and their average body mass index (BMI) was 30, which is considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 40 percent were given oral semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, while 32 received the injectable form of the drug. Another 12 percent took dulaglutide, found in the weight loss drug Trulicity, and eight percent took liraglutide, which is in Victoza and Saxenda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers followed up with participants at the start of the study, as well as after three months and one year, assessing weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood sugar (glucose), cholesterol and triglycerides, fats stored in the body's cells and used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also given questionnaires on their eating habits and put into groups based on emotional, external and restrained eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows changes in emotional, restraint and external eating at baseline, three months and 12 months. Higher scores indicate increases in the associated behaviors, while lower scores indicate decreases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers suggested people who emotionally eat may have underlying mental health issues that need to be addressed before Ozempic can properly work (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the three-month mark, the researchers found participants reported more restrained eating behaviors and fewer behaviors associated with emotional or external eating. But by the 12-month mark, restrained and emotional eating behaviors returned to their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eating, however, continued to decrease over the year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests people who tended to practice emotional eating were more likely to return to the unhealthy habit than those who practice external eating, resulting in less weight loss over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takehiro Kato, second study author and professor at Gifu University in Japan, said: 'One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the small sample size. The researchers also emphasized that the study shows associations between emotional eating and the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists rather than direct causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the team noted the findings could spark future research looking at the psychological barriers reducing the effectiveness of drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Yabe said: 'While our study suggests a potential association between external eating behavior and treatment response to GLP-1 receptor agonists, these findings remain preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further evidence is necessary before they can be implemented in clinical practice. Should future large-scale or randomized controlled trials validate this relationship, incorporating simple behavioral assessments could become a valuable component in optimizing treatment strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:14:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQUXdoVjQxOE9FQ3hrc29FTTZSeTRTT0lXMnlTZmMyOWdZb1FXaXNVU2g0SHg5UlhnZ3VoZ0RNRlE1TkExNlBNakFIQmNzR1p0RHpEV2dOSmFxaWpQSE1NRkFUOW0wME9tcVlOX1dkR3pHNTJVMkxDVlhiSFFlZEpKSW85UG92RXlvbFdFWEZnTjRRWHZiTjJGTWxDRDA</guid></item><item><title>科学家精确定位大脑的内部里程时钟- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjn6r7j23o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Scientists pinpoint the brain's internal mileage clock&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-c4820dd1-0 cYDsPh"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-c4820dd1-11 bxdaHR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-c4820dd1-5 iYeVyy"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-c4820dd1-7 dbQBRo"&gt;Victoria Gill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="undefined-role-location" class="sc-c4820dd1-8 evcqcz"&gt;Science correspondent, BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 ERpRj"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/72c1/live/91b2dce0-93b4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images The image shows a digital scan of a human brain - seen from above.

"[These cells] are in the part of the brain that provides that inner map – the ability to put yourself in the environment in your mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This study provides insight into exactly how that internal map in our brains works - and what happens when it goes awry. If you disrupt the ticking of that mileage clock by changing the environment, both rats and humans start getting their distance estimation wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In real life, this happens in darkness, or when fog descends when we're out on a hike. It suddenly becomes much more difficult to estimate how far we have travelled, because our mileage counter stops working reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;To investigate this experimentally, researchers trained rats to run a set distance in a rectangular arena - rewarding the animals with a treat - a piece of chocolate cereal - when they ran the correct distance and then returned to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When the animals ran the correct distance, the mileage-counting cells in their brains fired regularly - approximately every 30cm a rat travelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The more regular that firing pattern was, the better the animals were at estimating the distance they had to go to get that treat," explained Prof Ainge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The researchers were able to record the brain's mileage clock counting the distance the rat had moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Crucially, when the scientists altered the shape of the rat arena, that regular firing pattern became erratic and the rats struggled to work out how far they needed to go before they returned to the start for their chocolate treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's fascinating," said Prof Ainge. "They seem to show this sort of chronic underestimation. There's something about the fact that the signal isn't regular that means they stop too soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The scientists likened this to visual landmarks suddenly disappearing in the fog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Obviously it's harder to navigate in fog, but maybe what we what people don't appreciate is that it also impairs our ability to estimate distance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;To test this in humans, the researchers scaled up their rat-sized experiment. They built a 12m x 6m arena in the university's student union and asked volunteers to carry out the same task as the rats - walking a set distance, then returning to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Just like rats, human participants were consistently able to estimate the distance correctly when they were in a symmetrical, rectangular box. But when the scientists moved the walls of their purpose-built arena to change its shape, the participants started making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ainge explained: "Rats and humans learn the distance estimation task really well, then, when you change the environment in the way that we know distorts the signal in the rats, you see exactly the same behavioural pattern in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Silvia Ventura The image is a close-up of two laboratory rats - with black faces and white bodies.

"[These cells] are in the part of the brain that provides that inner map – the ability to put yourself in the environment in your mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This study provides insight into exactly how that internal map in our brains works - and what happens when it goes awry. If you disrupt the ticking of that mileage clock by changing the environment, both rats and humans start getting their distance estimation wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In real life, this happens in darkness, or when fog descends when we're out on a hike. It suddenly becomes much more difficult to estimate how far we have travelled, because our mileage counter stops working reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;To investigate this experimentally, researchers trained rats to run a set distance in a rectangular arena - rewarding the animals with a treat - a piece of chocolate cereal - when they ran the correct distance and then returned to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When the animals ran the correct distance, the mileage-counting cells in their brains fired regularly - approximately every 30cm a rat travelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The more regular that firing pattern was, the better the animals were at estimating the distance they had to go to get that treat," explained Prof Ainge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The researchers were able to record the brain's mileage clock counting the distance the rat had moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Crucially, when the scientists altered the shape of the rat arena, that regular firing pattern became erratic and the rats struggled to work out how far they needed to go before they returned to the start for their chocolate treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's fascinating," said Prof Ainge. "They seem to show this sort of chronic underestimation. There's something about the fact that the signal isn't regular that means they stop too soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The scientists likened this to visual landmarks suddenly disappearing in the fog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Obviously it's harder to navigate in fog, but maybe what we what people don't appreciate is that it also impairs our ability to estimate distance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;To test this in humans, the researchers scaled up their rat-sized experiment. They built a 12m x 6m arena in the university's student union and asked volunteers to carry out the same task as the rats - walking a set distance, then returning to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Just like rats, human participants were consistently able to estimate the distance correctly when they were in a symmetrical, rectangular box. But when the scientists moved the walls of their purpose-built arena to change its shape, the participants started making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ainge explained: "Rats and humans learn the distance estimation task really well, then, when you change the environment in the way that we know distorts the signal in the rats, you see exactly the same behavioural pattern in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e300/live/4b2ba300-93b5-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Silvia Ventura The image is a close-up of two laboratory rats - with black faces and white bodies.

Respiratory virus season is coming. Policy changes based on misinterpreted data will have immediate, real-world consequences. Frankly, even if the votes end up in favor of these vaccines, so much damage is being done through these public shows of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine rhetoric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday and Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans to vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine; the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth; and Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The upcoming votes threaten parental choice,” Steier said. “Without ACIP recommendations, insurance may not cover vaccines. The Vaccines for Children program could stop providing them. Families who want to protect their children may lose that option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former top official in charge of vaccination at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B vaccine recommendation, for example, may be pushed from birth to four years of age, which could mean the virus, which has dropped by 99% among young people, begins spreading in greater numbers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The committee may also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;further narrow&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re expecting them to present unverified VAERS reports as if they’re confirmed vaccine deaths,” Steier said, comparing that tactic to “treating every 911 call as proof of a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Several new members have a history of opposing vaccines, especially Covid vaccines and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Remember, the Lord Jesus did not fear lepers, and leprosy was (and continues to be) a highly contagious infectious disease,” Catherine Stein, a professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601043817/https://www.allinohio.com/an-epidemiologists-perspective-on-covid-19-the-other-side/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. “Not only did He heal them, but He touched them. He showed no fear, nor did He ‘socially distance’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stein wrote that she was motivated by her religious ideology to reject precautions like wearing face masks, which she said function as a “symbol of fear” while also harming the wearer’s health, which is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She argued that “as Christians, we should not fear death”. She also claimed that “this virus is not the scary killer the media and government portray it to be”, even in the midst of deadly waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In her off-work hours, Stein has &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt; as a researcher for Health Freedom Ohio, an antivax group &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is now head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In February 2020, she signed on to a &lt;a href="https://freedomofconscience.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRF-Roundtable-Protecting-Religious-Freedom.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Trump to reexamine school and daycare vaccine mandates and to focus on “ending the persecution of the unvaccinated people of faith”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kirk Milhoan is a pediatric cardiologist who has advocated against Covid vaccines because of the extremely rare possibility of myocarditis, or swelling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,” Milhoan &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; KFF Health News in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Milhoan is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, which has promoted ineffective and often unsafe ivermectin treatments for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Hawaii medical board filed complaints and &lt;a href="https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2022/04/doctors-cleared-of-covid-19-misinformation-allegations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; his medical license, though his license was ultimately upheld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evelyn Griffin, once an obstetrician/gynecologist who &lt;a href="https://x.com/EvelynGriffinM1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shifted&lt;/a&gt; to “holistic health”, implied at a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralcitynews.us/videos/3843797775903484/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Louisiana health freedom day&lt;/a&gt;” event in May 2024 that vaccines are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the [Covid] vaccine came out, they blindly believed that the vaccine had no harm,” she said of other doctors. “In medical school, we were taught the childhood vaccines – we were taught that they were harmless, and we were taught to just memorize the schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Griffin participated in a “Stop Vax Passports” &lt;a href="https://stopvaxpassports.org/webinar-covid-injections-and-women-miscarriage-infertility-and-more/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, speaking about her personal experience “treating post-injection women” and “defeating vaccine mandates for children in Louisiana.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hillary Blackburn, the daughter-in-law of Sen.

A group called the Evidence Collective documented more than &lt;a href="https://www.evicollective.org/tec-briefs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; from the first meeting of the new ACIP group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine committee may have up to 19 members, which means there are still six potential spots to be filled. Usually, the vetting and training process for new advisers takes months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1idzBiTlJpZ2pYd25LY0VuOUdnSDNYN1ctajVDZkpzUnVpVkhIXzQwWTZfdldIWUdjU0pzbUZXVmhLMzZlNndpNkgyTzViTFVrN3RXZGh3djVuRHJiVlRKS1ViUGpfZUxYOGlDN210TGptb1lyclMteQ</guid></item><item><title>根据FDA关于新冠疫苗的新指南，我还能在堪萨斯州接种疫苗吗？ - Wichita Eagle</title><link>https://www.kansas.com/news/state/article312053549.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With federal agencies &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/17/congress/sanders-rips-into-kennedy-over-monarez-firing-vaccine-rollbacks-00568450"&gt;rolling back vaccine research, access and more&lt;/a&gt; under U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Kansans seeking this year’s updated COVID-19 vaccine might face new restrictions and challenges getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the 2025-26 vaccine for use, but for a narrower pool of Americans. The authorized emergency use for previous COVID vaccines, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization-archived-information"&gt;including Moderna and Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;, has also been rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment echoed those changes in an Aug. 27 press release, stating the new COVID vaccines are only approved for certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The updated 2025–2026 COVID-19 vaccines are approved for individuals 65 years of age and older, and for those 6 months through 64 years with certain underlying conditions,” &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1686"&gt;the press release reads.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024-25 COVID vaccines are no longer authorized to be administered, the press release says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who do not fall into those categories can still get the vaccine with a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540088/covid-vaccine-2025-cdc-fda-guidelines"&gt;prescription from their health care provider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the FDA changed its guidance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not decided if it should change its recommendations. The agency &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;currently recommends anyone older than 17 get the vaccine&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;/a&gt;for parents of children from 6 months to 17 to consult with their primary care doctor. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;is scheduled to meet this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several organizations continue to recommend routine vaccination to those younger than 65, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccines have been proven &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/how-they-work.html"&gt;to be safe and effective in fighting the virus,&lt;/a&gt; especially when it comes to avoiding severe side effects and hospital stays. Most &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/downloads/COVID19-finding-vaccine-fall.pdf"&gt;private insurance covers the vaccination, as do some Medicare and Medicaid plans. &lt;/a&gt;Contact your insurance provider to see if your plan requires a co-pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment’s vaccine dashboard, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2165/Data"&gt;only 11.2% of Kansans received last year’s COVID vaccine.&lt;/a&gt; The state does not report specific COVID case counts anymore, but did report &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/EssenceDashboard/Respiratory?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y"&gt;10.6% of emergency department visits the week of Sept. 7 to 13&lt;/a&gt; were for all respiratory viruses. Of those, 0.8% of cases that same week were confirmed to be COVID-19, according to the state’s dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Where can I get my COVID vaccine in Sedgwick County or Wichita?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Gibbs, director of strategic communications with Sedgwick County, said the county is still awaiting CDC and ACIP’s recommendations in regard to this year’s COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials have consistently advocated for vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, we can still get COVID [with the vaccine], but with being up-to-date with vaccines it really reduces chances for severe cases,” Sedgwick County Health Department Director Adrienne Byrne&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.kansas.com/news/coronavirus/article284860541.html"&gt; told The Eagle in a 2024 interview.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wichita Eagle checked the CVS and Walgreens online schedule portals for Wichita locations, and both said eligibility requirements will have to be met in order to receive the updated vaccination. However, a spokesperson for CVS told The Eagle in an email that the pharmacy can still offer COVID vaccines to the public without doctor approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make an &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/get-vaccinated"&gt;appointment for vaccines through CVS online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;September 18, 2025 at 10:01 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

            While human cases of rabies in the United States are rare, it’s still a deadly disease: six people have died from rabies nationwide since September 2024, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed to CNN. In addition, the CDC is tracking 14 potential outbreaks in 20 states,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00013b6n24jvpvix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is rabies? How is it transmitted and by which animals? What are the symptoms of infection in humans, and is there a vaccine? How should rabies exposure be treated? And what can people do to reduce their risk of exposure?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is rabies, and how is it transmitted?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00073b6nafmcn7j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Rabies is caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank"&gt;deadly virus&lt;/a&gt; that is spread mainly through the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is part of the Rhabdoviridae family and genus Lyssavirus, which comprises 16 virus species. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;All 16&lt;/a&gt; can cause rabies disease in humans, though the rabies virus is by far the most common cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00083b6nw3gngx37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This virus is typically transmitted through an animal bite, though scratches or &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;direct contact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa" target="_blank"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt; can also spread the virus. For instance, if the saliva of the infected animal comes in contact with a human’s eyes, mouth or open wounds, the virus could be spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00093b6no90dkcc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus primarily affects the central nervous system, with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;incubation period&lt;/a&gt;, the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset, may last weeks to months. Once a person starts showing symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000a3b6nhohp8qht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs are responsible for the majority of human rabies deaths worldwide, and young children are frequent victims, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, where rabid dogs are far less common due to effective rabies prevention programs, contact with infected bats is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Nearly%20three%20in%20four%20Americans,States%20were%20infected%20by%20bats." target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of human rabies deaths. Rabies can be found in many other wildlife species, including raccoons, skunks, coyotes and foxes. According to the CDC, around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt; animal rabies cases are reported every year, with 90% occurring in wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000c3b6n5ug26anx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; During the incubation period, there are typically no symptoms. Weeks to months after exposure, an infected person may experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that can include fever, headache and overall body aches. Discomfort, such as a prickling sensation, at the site of the bite is also possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000e3b6ndrrfnljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms quickly progress. Within two weeks, the infected person starts having increasingly severe symptoms such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations and aggressive behavior. A classic symptom is hydrophobia, or fear of water: Despite feeling very thirsty, the individual may seem to panic at the sight of fluids. The person may also produce a lot of saliva and appear agitated, thrashing arms and legs. Death occurs not long after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who is at higher risk for rabies?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the CDC, someone traveling to areas where rabid dogs are a problem is at a higher risk of contracting the rabies virus, as are people who may encounter animals through work or leisure activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000h3b6nbq8kcmi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;helpful website&lt;/a&gt; that lists rabies status by country. Information includes the prevalence of rabies, whether a robust surveillance and prevention program is in place, and whether treatment is readily available if exposure occurs. WHO also has a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;useful website&lt;/a&gt; documenting areas with recent cases of human rabies. Annually, an estimated 60,000 people die from rabies worldwide; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of these fatalities occur in Africa and Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000i3b6njqhp26f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are visiting a country with a higher rabies risk, consider taking extra precautions, especially if it will be difficult to access rabies treatment if you are exposed to the virus. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, animal control officers, wildlife workers, laboratory workers who handle live rabies virus and people in similar professions should also consider prophylaxis. The same goes for people planning to hike in remote areas with dog-transmitted rabies or to explore caves in regions where rabid bats have been.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000j3b6nwlhgiynk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Can you explain what this prophylaxis is? Can people get vaccinated against rabies?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000k3b6n3lt9746x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Someone at high risk of being exposed to rabies can get the rabies vaccine as part of what’s called pre-exposure prophylaxis — that is, vaccination before any exposure occurs — to provide protection in case contact with the virus happens later. In these cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/pre-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the vaccine spaced seven days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000l3b6n8wqau4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depending on an individual’s risk exposure, the CDC recommends taking additional precautions. People in Risk Category 1, the highest risk, should have their blood checked for antibody titers six months after the second dose of the vaccine to make sure they are optimally protected. This category includes lab workers in contact with live or concentrated virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfolvd2p000a3b6nmxykdihk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in Risk Category 2, which includes those who frequently handle bats or dead animals, should have their antibody titers checked every two years. Most veterinarians, technicians, wildlife workers and animal control officers are considered Risk Category 3: They can either opt for a one-time antibody titer check between one to three years after the two-dose vaccination or receive a one-time booster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For the general US population, however, the rabies vaccine is not recommended as pre-exposure prophylaxis. The vaccine is essential, though, as part of post-exposure prophylaxis, the therapies given to someone after a possible rabies exposure to prevent the disease from developing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000n3b6nhzb2whca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is considered a possible rabies exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000o3b6nmyocsg9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The clearest example is someone who has been bitten by a wild dog, bat, fox, raccoon or other animal known to carry rabies. If someone had direct contact with a bat — for instance, waking up to find a bat in the room — this is also considered a possible exposure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/diagnosis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;unless a bite or scratch&lt;/a&gt; can be definitively ruled out. If possible, contain the animal so it can be observed and tested, but do not attempt to capture it if that may result in additional exposure. If you find a dead bat, do not throw it away. Do not touch it or allow other people or pets to touch it. Instead, call animal control so that the bat can be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000p3b6ntzx1l1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not sure whether a possible exposure warrants treatment, it is always best to contact a health care provider. Your local or state health department can also help evaluate whether you need rabies-related care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; If you suspect rabies exposure, seek medical care right away. First, contact your primary care physician, who will generally refer you to the hospital emergency department for the first part of the treatment. Some urgent care centers may also administer the treatment. If you do not have a primary care physician, go directly to the emergency department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000s3b6nfy45w35g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have a wound, it will be washed thoroughly with soap and water immediately. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html#:~:text=Post%2Dexposure%20prophylaxis%20recommendations&amp;amp;text=A%20dose%20of%20human%20rabies,14%20after%20the%20first%20dose." target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, what will happen next depends on whether you have ever been vaccinated against rabies. If you have never been vaccinated against rabies, you will be given both the human rabies immunoglobulin and a rabies vaccine. You will then need three more doses of the vaccine, on Days 3, 7 and 14 (Day 0 being the day you received the first dose). People with immune disorders would receive a fifth dose on Day 28.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000t3b6neqxkxak8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have been vaccinated against rabies, you would not receive the immunoglobulin. However, you would still need two doses of the vaccine, one given on the initial day and one three days later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your pets up-to-date on their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;rabies vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Stay away from wildlife and stray animals, and make sure your pets do as well. Also teach children not to handle or approach unfamiliar animals. If you see a wild animal such as a fox or raccoon behaving unusually, do not get close, and contact animal control instead. In addition, try to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent bats&lt;/a&gt; from getting inside your home through windows, chimneys or other holes. Most importantly, if you, a family member or a pet is potentially exposed to rabies, seek medical care immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beef contains a number of beneficial nutrients for muscle growth and recovery, including:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine:&lt;/strong&gt; The compound increases stores of energy in your muscles, enabling them to sustain tough workouts. It also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/muscle-recovery-foods" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;helps with muscle recovery&lt;/a&gt;, reducing concentrations of enzymes linked to muscle damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-carnitine: &lt;/strong&gt;This molecule carries fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they’re used for energy. This preserves some of the glycogen (energy) stores in your muscles, so you can train longer and harder. It preserves &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/amino-acids-7255497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; for the body to use for muscle rebuilding post-workout, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carnosine&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the most abundant antioxidants in meat, carnosine helps reduce soreness and muscle tiredness by balancing the pH levels in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta-alanine: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a building block of carnosine, found abundantly in beef and other meats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For best results, eat lean beef &lt;strong&gt;post-workout.&lt;/strong&gt; Try grilling it, stir-frying it with vegetables, or adding it to stews.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_131-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This makes them a great snack for athletes—vitamin E and other &lt;strong&gt;antioxidants help tamp down inflammation in the body, which can otherwise make you feel tired and sore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_133-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/foods-high-in-antioxidants-7480682" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are an amazing addition to any diet and should definitely be included in an athlete’s diet,” Reavis Jr said. “But &lt;strong&gt;prioritize this throughout the day,&lt;/strong&gt; and do not overemphasize it in the pre- and post-workout period.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_134-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_135-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can add almonds to energy bites, yogurt, oatmeal, trail mixes, or smoothies. Or, try adding almond butter to toast or pancakes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_138-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you spend a lot of time exercising, it’s important to &lt;strong&gt;incorporate high-protein and high-quality foods into your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s even better if those foods contain nutrients such as carnosine or creatine, or various forms of antioxidants to support your workouts and recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_139-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_140-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It depends on the individual, but in general, &lt;strong&gt;aim to eat 60–90 g of carbohydrates and 20–30 g of protein post-workout, &lt;/strong&gt;Reavis Jr recommended.
