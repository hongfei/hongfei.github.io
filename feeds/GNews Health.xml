                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials have expanded approval of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;a much-debated drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aimed at &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-3b04306fd1da48b2bb5d1c56db2ea175"&gt;boosting female libido&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug’s use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7779b97e8bbc44e08827013e528dc1f9"&gt;Addyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;low sex drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addyi, marketed by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-execs-behind-female-libido-pill-have-run-afoul-of-fda-c6bc3317da92422b967fa6ddb8ff73aa"&gt;Sprout Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women’s health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street’s initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval “reflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women’s sexual health is understood and prioritized.” The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug’s modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women’s rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been updated to correct the age range of the FDA approval update. The agency approved the drug for postmenopausal women up to age 65, not older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Suddenly, he wasn’t steady on his feet. His hands started trembling, and he struggled to grip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QXSNBKUCXZG63BN5IEPDVWLCSQ"&gt;Barlow grew peanuts, soybeans and corn at his family farm in Opp, an Alabama town of about 6,700 people just north of the Florida line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X2X6IWAGFRCQLPH3TOVGL3NZXY"&gt;At first, he thought his symptoms were a normal part of getting older, particularly because he’d worked so hard for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KS6522D56RD4RHJET6O3UOOYHU"&gt;One day he ran into a neighbor who’d recently been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. She asked if Barlow used paraquat, a highly effective but lethal weed killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SFQAH2VKMVBDDFVY4AXIHR6V4M"&gt;Suddenly, it clicked in his head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IEJ2B6C2AFA3DBPZ6R4CFYYAUU"&gt;Barlow, who is now 70, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s a few years ago.

Yet last year, its manufacturer Syngenta, a subsidiary of a company owned by the Chinese government, continued selling paraquat in the United States and other nations that haven’t banned it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="customEmbed_01"&gt;&lt;div class="article__custom-image"&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Mac Barlow started paraquat in the 1980s and didn’t stop until around five or six years ago — not until after he learned about research that shows a link between Parkinson’s and paraquat.&lt;span class="credits"&gt; Ramsey Archibald | rarchibald@al.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;‘Nothing else has the odor of it’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVBJ4A53SZBGZOLVNYXFYO2DMA"&gt;Barlow grew up in a farming family, but struck out on his own in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4SF2VUHL5ZAXTJPRG36CMGSQJU"&gt;He met his wife, Miriam, in high school. They married in 1976, when he was 21 and she was 18. A month later, they moved into the house where they still live today. The cluttered-but-cozy farmhouse sits among hundreds of acres of green fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IWNNM3KHL5HDNPRRVV6FNHF6GU"&gt;In 1998, the Barlows won “Farm Family of the Year” from the Opp Chamber of Commerce and were featured in the local paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CPUTNNVOGJDKLMRP2U5G2X6Q2I"&gt;Their daughter, Kristee, took first place in 4-H for the peanuts she grew in high school. Her dad, of course, helped her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PWDI4MGWNGDJCYFSZ67RQRHPA"&gt;Paraquat is known as a “burn down” pesticide. It can clear fields rapidly without the need to disturb the soil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B2PK6HUBZ5DSDGYDHSQFQDWI5Y"&gt;Once or twice a year, Barlow used paraquat to do just that, clear his fields and tame the weeds to prepare for the next growing season. It&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;was hard to beat the convenience, he said, as it worked without him having to move dirt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X2NSGI4KM5A4XDENHCQF2DUSHE"&gt;Sometimes, he would mix it with other pesticides to protect the peanuts from being “burned” by the paraquat, while still killing weeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W7R5BGN2MFF3BPLS6MFK425D3A"&gt;Barlow thought he knew the risks of using paraquat. He said he attended a class at the Auburn University Cooperative Extension on restricted pesticides. But he says no one told him about the possible risk of getting Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FTAQGYXDWVB63NBJMRPPJSUEZA"&gt;When he sprayed, he donned long pants, long sleeves, boots and a mask. He mixed the paraquat with water, adding it to the tank last to minimize exposure. Still, there was only so much he could do: any time he turned into the wind, the paraquat would blow right back on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="quote-container"&gt;&lt;div class="impact-quote blockquote"&gt;&lt;div class="quote-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For about 40 years off and on, I’ve been using that stuff...if I knew it was going to be that bad, I would have tried to figure out something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="source-attribution"&gt;Mac Barlow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EV7ILVEWCFGTNEQI3WH33DROTQ"&gt;He held the nozzle and sprayed paraquat from the back of a tractor all day long. One tank of the paraquat mix covered around ten acres. He would go through eight to ten tanks in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TIQTNMGXGZDQVM2VC6T4QBWUM4"&gt;“Nothing else has the odor of it,” Barlow said. “We’d just come up with rotten eggs, or just a distinct smell to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MMGOFYE5WNEABIWDOSXZTWAQCM"&gt;Each night, after he was done spraying the weed killer, Barlow said, he’d smell it in his hair and on his clothes. His wife made him undress and shower before he came inside the house. She washed his work clothes separately, with nothing else in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AYIJSKMPZBHC5NMBWFGKMIJBJU"&gt;By the time Barlow was farming 1,000 acres of peanuts, it would take him around two weeks to spray all of his fields with paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DXORRVE3CVAHBCHFNDQNPLDXR4"&gt;He started using the chemical in the 1980s and didn’t stop until around five or six years ago — not until after he learned about research that shows a link between Parkinson’s and paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="customEmbed_01"&gt;&lt;div class="article__custom-image"&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Miriam Barlow, right, adjusts her husband Mac’s collar before posing for a photo in their den on the family farm.&lt;span class="credits"&gt; Julie Bennett | preps@al.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VZEZAEGL2JBIDE2B66ORRQBKXQ"&gt;Meanwhile, Syngenta says that “despite decades of investigation and more than 1,200 epidemiological and laboratory studies of paraquat, no scientist or doctor has ever concluded in a peer-reviewed scientific analysis that paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JJ36FLVQJBHWDAOI2KBKLHKG2Q"&gt;“We have great sympathy for those suffering from the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease,” a Syngenta spokesperson said in a statement. “However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence simply does not support a causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease, and that paraquat is safe when used as directed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6XYPEQ7CXBF27HUAFMYA3SADSY"&gt;Still, Barlow said he believes all those years of spraying paraquat is what caused his Parkinson’s disease. He said he doesn’t have&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;a family history of neurological diseases that might indicate a genetic factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UOGWJ3MMUBD3XCNZ6J2C6GT4IY"&gt;After talking to his neighbor, who informed him of the possible link between paraquat and Parkinson’s, Barlow said, he started seeing advertisements to join the lawsuit against Syngenta. An attorney friend encouraged him to look into it, and Barlow sent his information off to the Beasley Allen law firm in Montgomery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LVSJTRGFORE3XG5TKO5WD4PWPA"&gt;Now he’s among thousands of people across the nation who have joined the multi-district litigation against Syngenta and Chevron, the companies that make paraquat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NRQVJOXEERGM7OEWRY5HLNL5RE"&gt;In their lawsuit, lawyers for Barlow and his wife argue that Syngenta “knew or should have known that paraquat was a highly toxic substance that can cause severe neurological injuries and impairment.” Yet, according to the suit, the company “continued to promote its product as safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5NG7TIDANHRPLFTVYUWWIPDIY"&gt;Attorney Elizabeth Walden said the lawsuits are about “standing up for people whose lives have been upended by exposure to a dangerous product.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36" data-gaid="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5OC272M3RCCNBONIJSCF5PUEY"&gt;“Behind every case file is a family facing unimaginable challenges after trusting the tools they worked with,” she told AL.com. “Barlow perfectly represents our clients as a lifelong farmer and pillar of his community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37" data-gaid="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZSXL3E3GXJFOTDO5BNCFAXITYQ"&gt;A few bellwether cases representing all of the people suing could be tried in front of a federal judge in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NCZLFAFOTFA5FCVBDGNHXTDWBU"&gt;But in April, the parties agreed to settle and wrap up all of the cases.

                &lt;p&gt;The flu season is picking up pace, new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s looking to be a doozy this winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s surveillance, seasonal flu activity has increased throughout most of the country in recent weeks. Surges of flu have already led to school closures in some areas, while at least one pediatric death has been recorded so far. This season is being driven by a novel variant of H3N2 flu, dubbed subclade K—a variant that our vaccines are ill-equipped against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An emerging, unexpected threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a flu season, multiple variants of influenza A and influenza B viruses will spread between people. Because conventional vaccines take time to produce, public health experts try to predict which flu strains will be circulating up to nine months before flu season starts in each hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This winter, however, subclade K has thrown a wrench into our plans. The variant emerged toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and it’s proven to be genetically different and fit enough to quickly supplant other strains of H3N2 and other flu viruses in general. What’s worse, the seasonal flu vaccine is poorly matched to subclade K, reducing its ability to prevent infection and illness from the strain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The emergence of subclade K already &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.49.2500894"&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; the flu season in parts of the Southern Hemisphere like Australia and New Zealand. It’s also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;jumpstarted&lt;/a&gt; the flu season weeks ahead of schedule in European countries. In the UK, subclade K is currently helping cause a spike of hospitalizations and an “&lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;unprecedented wave of super flu,&lt;/a&gt;” according to NHS officials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s latest data, covering the first week of December, shows that respiratory virus activity in the U.S. is low overall, but this peace likely won’t last long. Flu cases meriting medical care are rising in most parts of the country, with 8.1% of lab tests coming back positive for flu (two weeks earlier, it was 5%). Flu-related hospitalizations also appear to be increasing, and the first pediatric death linked to flu was reported last week. And schools in &lt;a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/mize-elementary-school-cancels-classes-friday-due-to-increase-in-flu-cases/"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-school-district-cancels-classes-tuesday-wednesday-due-to-widespread-illness-moulton-udell/69665507"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; have already had closures due to recent flu outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to do about the flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of new infections in the U.S. are being caused by H3N2, signaling that subclade K is rearing its ugly head here, too. And given what’s happening in other parts of the world, that doesn’t bode well for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, vaccination does remain an important part of staying safer this flu season. Despite the mismatch to subclade K, early UK data has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D."&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the seasonal vaccine is still effective at preventing severe illness from the flu, particularly in kids.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You should also practice good hygiene like regularly washing your hands, try to stay home if you’re sick, and potentially wear a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection (well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 being the most effective).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost. Also watch out for dehydration, which is “the biggest concern with complications from most stomach bugs,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re losing a lot of fluids with vomiting, a lot of fluids with diarrhea,” Vasagar said. Signs of dehydration include decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, confusion, and fatigue. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, whether that’s water, tea, Gatorade or soup, Gooden noted. Even if you’re throwing up, you should still drink small amounts of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to monitor for any development of severe symptoms,” Gooden said. “If your symptoms continue beyond 72 hours, usually, that’s a time that I would advise to reach out to your health care professional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have fevers, severe abdominal pain, or develop blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention, Gooden added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/norovirus-surge-signs-symptoms-care_l_69334120e4b03cea5ab4422a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7996744"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost.

    &lt;p&gt;Michael
Avelar, of McKinleyville, passed away on November 29, 2025 at the age
of 42 after living for many years with Machado Joseph’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He
was born on March 15, 1983, in Arcata to Henry and Maria Avelar. His
arrival marked the beginning of a life defined by curiosity,
creativity, and deep connection. Michael grew up surrounded by a
warm, close-knit family who often gathered with relatives and
friends—always with plenty of food, laughter, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a boy, he loved playing Magic cards,
exploring computers, and reading fantasy books late into the
night—long past when he was supposed to be asleep. In his early
teens, he enjoyed playing golf. Michael joined a model rocket club,
building rockets with friends and his close cousin, Jason Lowe, and
delighted in launching them thousands of feet into the sky. His
fascination with the cosmos led to countless nights of telescope
viewing and astrophotography. Michael always wanted to understand how
everything worked and why, a lifelong curiosity that shaped much of
who he became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At
McKinleyville High School, Michael excelled academically. He was
intellectual, scientific, and absorbed knowledge like a sponge. He
thrived on challenging projects—often working extra hours simply
because he loved learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His passion for computers led him to pursue a
career in programming. After attending Humboldt State University,
working in the photo department at Longs Drugs, and living in Arcata,
Michael moved to Seattle, Washington. There, he spent most of his
adult career as a valued computer programmer at Moodlerooms, working
alongside his close childhood friend, Mark Nielsen, before returning
to his hometown of McKinleyville in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael enjoyed camping, fishing with his dad,
mushroom hunting &amp;amp; traveling—visiting Japan and Europe with
Mark, spending a summer in the Azores with family, cruising to the
Bahamas and Alaska, and taking many road trips, including two RV
journeys across the United States &amp;amp; Canada to see national parks
and monuments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In later years, Michael turned inward toward
spirituality. He found joy in spending time with family, taking
scenic drives, and experimenting in the kitchen — making jams, cider,
preserves, and baked treats, all “in the name of science.” Michael’s love of nature remained constant throughout his life. He
also continued to enjoy his evenings playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael
was preceded in death by his mother, Maria, and his brother, Nelson.
He is survived by his father, Henry; his sister, Melissa; his aunt
Elizabeth, her husband Geoff Wright; his cousins Grace, Gavin and
Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The
family extends profound gratitude to all of Michael’s health care
providers, and especially to Jeremy, who lived with Michael as his
primary caregiver and friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
honor of Michael, donations may be made to the National Ataxia
Foundation to help find a cure and ease for others. A celebration of
his life will be held at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ataxia.org"&gt;https://www.ataxia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Michael Avelar’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;loved ones.

She had started to feel a mild anxiety about her sense of direction and purpose in life earlier that year, but within a couple months, that had spiraled into a paranoia that she could neither shake nor explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Referred by her doctor, Dupas began consulting with different psychiatrists, all of whom considered diagnosing her with generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Most wanted to put her on medication right away. But one psychiatrist first ordered bloodwork to see if something else might be going on. “I was mostly depleted of magnesium,” Dupas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most people being treated for mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression typically use a mix of just two strategies: medication (usually an SSRI) and psychotherapy. But there’s increasing interest in the connection between food and the brain, and especially how nutrition could affect psychiatric conditions. Researchers have not only found a connection between the &lt;a href="/2014/11/26/7289495/microbiome-gut-bacteria-health"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and mental health, but also connections between deficiencies in certain micronutrients, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390811003054"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7#Sec28"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;, and conditions like anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s less clear is how supplementation could alleviate certain symptoms. We don’t have robust clinical trial data showing how micronutrients affect people’s mental health, and the role of supplements in mental health is understudied, particularly because the research can be so challenging. Most supplements also don’t require approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to go to market, meaning there’s an abundance of different options, most of which have different formulas that aren’t robustly studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While researchers have long understood that nutrition is important for brain health, people don’t typically look to their diets as a way to improve their mental health, and doctors don’t always think to connect mental health with diet. The link between food and the brain “is overlooked by most people,” says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18123/uma-naidoo"&gt;Uma Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of the 2023 book&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/uma-naidoo-md/calm-your-mind-with-food/9780316502092/"&gt;Calm Your Mind With Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Future research to clarify the link between micronutrients — through either food or supplements — and mental health outcomes could help us stop underestimating that link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-diet-is-linked-to-mental-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diet is linked to mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The connection between diet and the brain seems counterintuitive, but it’s actually linked to basic biology. “The same environment where food is being digested is also the environment where neurotransmitters are produced,” Naidoo says. The gut produces most of the body’s serotonin, as well as a good portion of the neurotransmitter GABA. Drugs used to alter levels of serotonin are frequently used to treat depression and anxiety. The most common group are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the best understood links between nutrition and mental health involves how food affects the gut microbiome. Researchers have known for years now that &lt;a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13712"&gt;gut inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and changes in the gut microbiome are linked to mental conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/abstract/S0166-2236(13)00008-8?kuid=79939ea6-6dfb-43bc-b620-d9ab0df56eaf&amp;amp;kref=https%3A%2F%2Fkemperwellness.com%2Fblog%2Flets-get-real-about-anxiety-and-mental-health%2F"&gt;anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly other &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-023-05003-4"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s also a growing and ongoing interest in how specific vitamins and minerals affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“The brain and mental health are no longer just ‘above the neck’ problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Mass General&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Deficiencies in several different micronutrients, including magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/9/2232"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40263-019-00640-4"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2702216"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7#Sec28"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16930802/"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to affect mental health conditions. Researchers can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390811003054"&gt;induce anxiety in mice&lt;/a&gt;, for example, by manipulating and lowering their magnesium levels. The extent to which supplementation affects mental health in humans is less well-established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The research so far is a little sparse and mixed. A&lt;a href="https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/237565/20240430-16558-smymmw.pdf?"&gt; 2024 review&lt;/a&gt; found that “supplemental magnesium is likely useful in the treatment of mild anxiety and insomnia,” especially in people with already low magnesium. But across studies, results showing how much magnesium supplements can help people with mental health conditions like anxiety or depression are often inconsistent, likely because there are so many different forms these supplements can take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Magnesium, for example, can be taken as a supplement in the forms of magnesium citrate, magnesium malate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, and more. How well the body can make use of magnesium in these different forms, and how good these different forms are at delivering magnesium to the brain still needs to be better studied, says Alexander Rawji, a psychiatrist in Long Island, New York, and the lead author of the paper. Similar challenges exist for other micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As you may have learned in high school biology, eating varied foods rich in certain vitamins and minerals is crucial because your body cannot make its own supply and yet relies on them to perform critical functions. And research suggests that most Americans don’t get nearly enough of many micronutrients. Previous &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview#toc-micronutrient-deficiencies-and-inadequacies-"&gt;national survey data&lt;/a&gt; said that as much as 94 percent of the US population does not get adequate daily vitamin D, 52 percent don’t get enough magnesium, and 92 percent don’t get enough choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Few people would argue that diet is completely unimportant for brain health. But while a connection between nutrition and brain health is clear, the persistent gaps in scientific knowledge make it difficult to really say what role supplements should play in the treatment of mental illness. Ideally, future research would get us to a place where we better understand how micronutrients in the diet distinctly affect the workings of the brain, as well as which supplements are best absorbed by the body and brain. On top of that, we don’t even fully &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201804/we-scientists-know-so-little-about-mental-illness"&gt;understand the mechanisms that cause most mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-role-should-nutrition-play-in-mental-health-care" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role should nutrition play in mental health care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once her blood test results came back, Dupas’ psychiatrist put her on a regimen of supplements — magnesium, L-theanine, B-complex vitamins, and omega-3s — in addition to a small dose of an SSRI. But Dupas didn’t stay on the medication for long. After a couple weeks, “I felt really clear again,” she says. “I could focus again and not feel paranoid that people are coming after me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dupas could be an outlier. Research suggests the vast majority of people with a mental health condition won’t see dramatic improvement of their symptoms from supplementation alone. Nevertheless, she’s grateful that she stumbled across a doctor who actually ordered bloodwork to see if there may be any hidden culprits exacerbating symptoms and hopes more patients get similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Providers should be ordering bloodwork for patients, especially if they have multiple health conditions and medications that could be affecting their health, Rawji says. And if they have a deficiency, that’s certainly something to address. A complicating factor, however, is the fact that blood panels can’t always give you a perfect picture of what’s going on — tests to detect magnesium levels in blood serum often come back normal even if their body stores of magnesium are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Regardless, Rawji uses supplements as “part of a multipronged approach” in his treatment of patients, he says. How much the supplements will help will vary person to person, and they definitely shouldn’t replace other treatments, including medications like SSRIs or benzodiazepines. “If you expect magnesium to be a benzo for anxiety then you’re going to be very disappointed,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not all psychiatrists are trained to ask questions related to diet when assessing patients or to look for nutrition deficiencies, according to Naidoo, the doctor from Mass General. This could lead to ignoring relatively easy interventions that can make real differences. Furthermore, overemphasizing supplements comes with its own risks. If you eat a healthy, well-balanced whole foods diet, you’ll probably get more than enough of the vitamins and minerals you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s “almost always” an opportunity to use nutrition to improve mental health, since no one really has a perfect diet, says Naidoo. If you’re particularly concerned with including more of certain micronutrients into your diet, she suggests eating more green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes for magnesium. Milk, eggs, and whole grains are good sources of B vitamins; eggs, beans and cruciferous vegetables are good for choline; fatty fish and eggs are good for vitamin D; and you can get L-theanine from green tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nutrition is a huge, consequential tool for how we maintain our bodies. And we understand, now more than ever, that the importance of food for the body includes benefits for the brain. “The brain and mental health are no longer just ‘above the neck’ problems,” Naidoo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNUU9FNW10X2pncmdlazJ4b1hKVGx1WXJBMUhhUmMwRnRPWFhsS3FsLXo0aXBvQnpBaW8xMXdpcng2ZnQwc3Z1ck5mUFFua1E1R0pPbDFYbjc1R2F2cFBlUmVBU2hTUklKYTYySWtyQ0pHckh2V3BXNWxVeG5rMWNCTmJkaXNjUXBjdDRn</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎还是流感？以下是如何区分的方法- Yahoo Life UK</title><link>https://uk.style.yahoo.com/flu-covid-cold-symptoms-signs-health-winter-092559143.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As winter settles in, it’s not just the colder mornings and darker evenings making people feel a bit off – it’s the sudden surge in seasonal illnesses too.

'Heroin is ruining my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This man was my first patient when I became a psychologist 15 years ago, specialising in the field of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'll never forget him because, as he spoke to me about the power his addiction held over his life, I realised with a jolt that his story reflected my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My addiction wasn't to drugs, however. I was addicted to dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as he spoke, I realised that this man – and, after him, countless other patients who shared honest details of their powerlessness with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-617b57f0-d9a5-11f0-96fa-73a1cf6149d9"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, gambling and many other habits – reflected my own relationship with food back to me far better than any therapist or doctor ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All those patients described feeling short–changed by substance abuse, just as I felt utterly short-changed by my then-decades of dieting, which had only left me miserable, at war with my own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From my teenage years, I had tried every diet going – to no avail. At my heaviest, at 5ft 7in aged 21, I was almost 19st – both the fattest person and the most compulsive dieter around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was because, just as every high had left my patients more addicted to their vice, each of my own failed diets had only given me a stronger addiction to every aspect of the weight-loss cycle: the 'highs' for me were the sense of control that restrictive eating brought – and the release of the binge that would inevitably follow the diet's failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shahroo Izadi in her 20s – after a failed gastric–band operation and years of diets followed by heavy bingeing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I had been trained to support society's most change-resistant and highly addicted people. It was a revelation to realise my own behaviour was driven by similar emotional and biological – behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For alongside the psychological pendulum of the highs ('I'll be so happy when I lose the weight') and lows (the inevitable breaking point of a diet), the cycle of dieting and bingeing triggers a flood of chemicals in your brain that over time become entrenched – making each subsequent attempt at control more likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the diet industry actually wants you to fail – it needs you to feel broken, powerless and dependent on its solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because if you believed you could trust yourself around food, you'd stop buying diet products, joining weight–loss programmes and listening to the endless conflicting advice that keeps the industry profitable. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six years of working with NHS patients, I moved into private practice – helping people who suffered from substance misuse and running workshops for health workers on how to empower addicts to change for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But given my personal experience, one addiction fascinated me more than any other: dieting. It seemed everywhere I looked, I could see people like myself, quietly imprisoned in its cycle and who simply couldn't conceive of a life without being on a diet – despite how ineffective their eating plans proved in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I've heard tearful confessions of global leaders of industry who manage complex careers, but can't control themselves around a doughnut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reality is that smart, disciplined people can also be diet addicts, trapped in cycles of restrictive eating and wild food binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, this was my life until my late 20s. I remember first feeling dissatisfied with my shape aged ten, when other children would make fun of my size, and my family – concerned about my weight – encouraged me to eat less and avoid 'naughty' foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a teenager, I began taking appetite suppressants (bought online via pro–anorexia forums) and embraced absurdly restrictive diets: boiled eggs and cabbage soup; only celery; or just meat. I lost weight, but it was obviously unsustainable and I'd end up bingeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those binges taught me eating large quantities of fatty, sugary foods was exhilarating, euphoric – even emotionally numbing. I'd restrict for days, then see a photo and feel hopeless. That combined with hunger made me cancel plans and spend entire weekends eating to physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After every binge, though, came shame... and I would start a new diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was very similar to the trajectory of substance abuse. The more I dieted, the less effective those diets became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In turn, I started needing a higher 'dose' of my drug, if you will, just as a drug addict might – in my case, this took the form of making my diets even more restrictive to shift any weight at all, almost starving myself between binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As my diets became more intense, my binges became more extreme, too – so much so the skin on my stomach and thighs would itch (I looked up what this was, and discovered it was actually the formation of stretch marks – the skin stretching and tearing in real time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, in my second year of university, aged 21, I had gastric–band surgery paid for privately. Ashamed, I kept it secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially, I was able to eat as much as I had always done after the surgery – because the band had been installed around my upper stomach and was loose enough that I wouldn't feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once I'd recovered from the operation, I could return to get it tightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, in that pre-tightening stage, I ate almost nothing. Then, predictably, I ate everything 'one last time'. After all, I no longer needed to rely on myself to get thin – I had the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it was tightened, I lost weight quickly – so I kept asking the surgeon to tighten it as much as possible, essentially using it to starve myself. I went from a size 22/24 to a size 6 at my smallest, in about a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first time, I was very slim, around 52kg (8st 2lb). But old habits die hard. I was in and out of the clinic for 18 months, asking for extreme loosening or tightening, and playing out my restriction-rebellion pattern of crash dieting – only this time with a surgical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the band, I found ways to continue bingeing – soft, high-calorie foods I could get down, even when my stomach felt very tight. Eventually, the pain became unbearable and I was operated on again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon explained he'd had to remove the band because it had slipped from its original position (a recognised complication, which can be linked to overeating).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was 26 and had been struggling with the band for years – by then I weighed around 90kg (around 14st 2lb) again. I cried, knowing I'd hit rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I then went to therapy, a habit I would keep for the next decade. Eventually, it helped me think about my problem objectively and have compassion for myself, the way I would for anyone else. Like I would for any addict, as I now see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Izadi today... she says she is living proof that anyone can conquer addiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Encouraged by my therapist, I resolved to act as if I'd never lose weight. Before that point, I wouldn't wear make-up when overweight, do my hair or even light a candle at home – nice things were for thin people, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now I was to treat my body kindly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, I noticed I felt more deserving, and found myself losing weight and not gaining it back – simply because I wasn't eating uncontrollably. Then I had my eureka moment with my heroin-addicted patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I had already been trained in managing addictions by teaching patients simple techniques that help build their confidence to confront their addiction and break their habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I began to use these techniques myself – for example, one of the most powerful was to repeatedly say to myself as I fell into another binge: 'These hands are my hands'. It reinforced that I wasn't powerless. This technique is about preventing that experience from reinforcing the powerlessness that fuels addiction. In my case, it helped break the cycle of frantic over-consumption and restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By treating my struggle with the compassion I would give an addict struggling to stick to their programme, I lost 8st in 18 months. I had finally learned to manage my addiction to dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once I realised the overlap between my dysfunctional behaviour and other addictions I was treating as a medical professional, I began to research the exact biological and psychological mechanisms by which dieting addiction works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I've mentioned, diets create a psychological pendulum, where the 'high' of perfect restriction swings inevitably to the 'low' release of complete abandon – setting up a psychological dynamic where the eventual breakdown feels like both failure and release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the restriction phase increases stress hormones such as cortisol (because restricting food is stressful!), while simultaneously creating the psychological anticipation of future reward (joy on losing weight). It's a psychologically intoxicating, dangerous mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the inevitable breaking point of a diet triggers a flood of relief chemicals in your brain – dopamine, serotonin, endorphins – as you finally eat forbidden foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This relief is immediately followed by intense shame, creating another cortisol spike that drives the need for more relief. You return to restriction as the only way to escape the shame of failure, beginning the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The more times you cycle through diets, the deeper these psychological pathways become entrenched. Your attachment to dieting isn't logical – it's biochemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, research published in Obesity Reviews in 2015 shows just how repeated dieting only succeeds in heightening your body's response. Scientists found each cycle of weight loss and regain progressively amplifies both metabolic changes and psychological drive that lead you to overeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When I treated dieting like addiction recovery – gradually changing my habits, one step at a time, so eventually I was eating regularly, which prevented my body unleashing those biological responses which had fuelled my diet addiction, and so changed my entire mindset – the brain chemistry normalised. This took more than 18 months, and I lost 8st (I've maintained stable weight since 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But aside from this mental impact, what else makes diets doomed to fail – yet simultaneously addictive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also disrupt your body's hormone levels and other regulatory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you restrict food severely, even for short periods, your body can enter a state of perceived famine. It doesn't understand concepts like 'diet' or 'bikini body'. It simply registers a dangerous shortage of incoming energy and triggers a cascade of biological changes to protect you from potential starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because your body has a setpoint weight – a particular pre-determined weight range. Everyone's is naturally different – but the further below it you go, the more aggressively your body fights to preserve it, and the sooner your diet will fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, when you diet, your body reduces production of hormones that signal fullness – such as leptin, GLP–1 (the hormone used in weight-loss jabs such as Wegovy) and peptide YY – which in turn increases your appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Significantly, a 2011 study by the University of Melbourne tracked 50 dieters across 12 months and showed these hormonal adaptations persist long after weight loss, creating sustained biological pressure towards weight regain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In short, dieting makes you hungrier, even after you have finished dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also decrease your metabolism (the rate you burn calories) as your body slows down energy expenditure because it perceives a potential famine ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This perceived famine also affects the dieter's brain, causing an urgent 'eat now while you can' mindset as soon as food becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not gluttony or lack of discipline – rather a deep-rooted survival instinct, as your brain responds with appropriate urgency. Hence the frantic nature of binges that occur after diets: eating while standing up; barely chewing; and sometimes not even tasting the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also change how your brain responds to food, making your reward centres more sensitive to it. Research by Columbia University in 2008 used MRI scans and found that, after weight loss, brain regions associated with reward lit up more intensely when shown food images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that what would give a normal eater a mild pleasure response instead hits with the force of an overwhelming compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That first bite triggers dopamine release – a feelgood chemical in the brain involved in reward and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years of restriction-binge cycles make a dieter's brain hypersensitive to this response. That's why that first bite triggers such a powerful drive to keep eating. I've watched this in hundreds of clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps the most fascinating thing is what happens to a dieter's executive function, the part of the brain involved in rational decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets force one's executive function to be temporarily overridden by the urgent need to survive the perceived famine. Yale University research in 2011 showed food restriction reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex – home of the brain's executive function – while increasing activity in regions associated with reward-seeking. No amount of willpower can overcome this urge to eat. It's like trying to think your way out of a sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long periods of food restriction also wear down mental energy, a well-documented phenomenon known as cognitive depletion, which affects everyone under conditions of prolonged self-discipline, making impulse control much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Put simply then, diets are toxic for your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the ultimate goal of any abusive relationship is to create 'learned helplessness', a psychological state where victims stop believing escape is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like an abusive partner, diets create this state of mind through repeated experiences of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The diet industry is set up to profit from the lucrative cycle of failing, says Ms Izadi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even when you've experienced a diet's failure first-hand dozens of times, this state of learned helplessness keeps you trapped in the cycle. I've seen people for whom dieting has become so fused with their identity that they don't know who they would be without it. For these people, stopping dieting prompts a form of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So why isn't dieting commonly viewed as an addiction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I believe it remains largely undiagnosed because it falls through the cracks of existing clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are large overlaps with eating disorders, most obviously with binge-eating disorder (BED), where sufferers have recurring episodes of eating large quantities of food rapidly to the point of discomfort, accompanied by feelings of guilt or distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet addicts can be mislabelled as suffering from BED – but this is different from BED, because it has a large component of compulsive restriction to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's also obvious overlap between dieting addiction and anorexia – and also with bulimia's binge-eating episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At heart, I believe this psychological problem is caused by the modern diet industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After all, it is the diet industry – whether via meal-replacement shakes, calorie-counting plans or unbalanced protein-heavy diets such as Atkins and keto – which encourages us to attempt weight loss using quick-fix approaches that trigger biological starvation responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the vast majority of dieters regain weight. But this failure – and state of learned helplessness it inflicts – only means you'll chase another diet again, buying books, products and downloading apps, boosting the industry's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It profits from your shame of failing, in what is a perniciously lucrative cycle for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But you can conquer your addiction to its product – and rediscover your natural instincts around food. I'm living proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Why fat jabs aren't the answer...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My clinical work has shown me recovery from dieting and disordered eating requires you to develop an unshakeable self-trust around food. To know you can control yourself, on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why so many popular weight–loss tactics don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Take fat jabs – they portray food as the enemy and your powers of self-control as requiring external assistance. The same goes for fat camps, gastric bands and appetite suppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pre-prepared meals that arrive at your door are also another crutch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only route forwards is to painstakingly reform the habits that cause your overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Adapted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; How Diets Make Us Fat by Shahroo Izadi (Leap, £20). © Shahroo Izadi 2025.

    &lt;p&gt;Her message was echoed by Nick Thayer, the head of policy for the Company Chemists Association. He said there is “no national shortage of flu vaccines, but the bulk of them are administered in October and November”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that “by the time you get to December, some places are running low, and some will have none left from their original allocation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may therefore need to shop around for your flu vaccine. “Look on the websites for pharmacies, look on the NHS website, if you are eligible for a free jab or talk to your local pharmacy and ask,” Thayer advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to get the vaccine before Christmas, stick to the basics to reduce your risk of catching the flu. These include handwashing, avoiding crowded indoor gatherings, staying home when unwell, and self-isolating within families where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu jab remains a valuable layer of protection, according to Dr Clarke. It is safe and generally thought to achieve maximum protection for an individual after 10 to 14 days. Whilst there is still a chance you might get the flu after having the jab, it is likely to be milder and not last as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection from the flu vaccine goes down over the year and the types of virus it protects against are updated annually, which is why it is important to stay up to date with your inoculations, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst this year’s dominant strain is thought to be a mutated version of the influenza A virus, data shows that the flu vaccine still provides good protection against it. The UK Health Security Agency found it has been &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;70 to 75 per cent effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17, and 30 to 40 per cent effective in adults&lt;/a&gt;. This is broadly in line with effectiveness in previous flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 17 million vaccines have been delivered this autumn, which is 350,000 more compared to this time last year, although Dr Clarke wishes more of us would choose to be inoculated. The latest National Flu and Covid-19 Surveillance Report shows that only 70.9 per cent of over-65s have received their flu jab this season. Rates amongst eligible under-65s are far lower, hovering around 35 per cent. “It really would make a difference,” says Dr Clarke.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A plague that swept through Eurasia for 2,000 years – millennia before the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-dna-evidence-reveals-where-the-black-death-most-likely-originated"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of the Middle Ages – has only ever been detected in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-the-earliest-evidence-of-plague-in-a-neolithic-graveyard"&gt;human remains&lt;/a&gt;, until now. For decades, it has been unclear how the Bronze Age plague spread so widely, but now we know which animal was a likely carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of archaeologists sifted through scraps of DNA in the bones and teeth of Bronze Age cattle, goats, and sheep, as part of a large, ongoing study to track how these animals migrated, alongside humans, from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-dust-may-have-determined-the-spread-of-ancient-human-civilisations"&gt;Fertile Crescent&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle East across Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such ancient samples of animal DNA are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0569"&gt;never fully intact&lt;/a&gt;, usually quite fragmented, and very contaminated with the leftovers of organisms that inhabited the animal's body in life, and long after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/black-deaths-carnage-traced-to-a-volcanic-eruption-half-a-world-away"&gt;Black Death's Carnage Traced to a Volcanic Eruption Half a World Away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we test livestock DNA in ancient samples, we get a complex genetic soup of contamination," University of Arkansas archaeologist Taylor Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a large barrier to getting a strong signal for the animal, but it also gives us an opportunity to look for pathogens that infected herds and their handlers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pathogen Hermes and his colleagues encountered in the remains of a 4,000-year-old domesticated sheep unearthed at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkaim"&gt;Arkaim&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeological site &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkaim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in the Southern Ural Mountains of Russia, stopped them in their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one tooth was the DNA of the plague bacteria, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; an ancient strain that was unable to infect fleas, as it did later during the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/em&gt;had yet to figure out how to use fleas as a vector during the Bronze Age, archaeologists have often wondered how the plague spread so widely among humans. We know many humans died from infection, their bodies still containing genetic traces of an identical strain of plague, uncovered at sites thousands of kilometers apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of the Late Neolithic Bronze Age lineage of the bacteria found in a non-human animal, a discovery which the researchers shared &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancestor-of-black-death-has-been-discovered-in-bronze-age-sheep"&gt;in a preprint&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. The research has now been peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185507" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185507" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MapOfBronzeAgePlagueFoundInHumansAndSheep-642x268.jpg" alt="Map of Eurasia showing sites where human remains containing plague bacteria DNA have been found, and one sheep.

(Light-Maka et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to imagine how domestic sheep, roaming across the vast grasslands of the Eurasian Steppe, may have encountered a wild animal carrying the bacteria, but not made sick by it, and then spread it between herds and shepherds. However, the team notes they can't rule out human-to-sheep transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It had to be more than people moving. Our plague sheep gave us a breakthrough," Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now see it as a dynamic between people, livestock and some still unidentified 'natural reservoir' for it, which could be rodents on the grasslands of the Eurasian steppe or migratory birds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185219" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-642x639.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-185219" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-642x639.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-678x675.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-768x764.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-600x597.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185219" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Conceptual scenario of the LNBA lineage transmission concluded from sheep- and human-derived &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; genomes. (Light-Maka et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking down the DNA of ancient pathogens is tricky. People don't bury animals with the same care as they do other humans, so their remains are not usually so well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many specimens of domestic animals that archaeologists find are actually the leftovers of human meals, which means they tend to have been cooked (a sure-fire way to break down the DNA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-black-death-shaped-human-evolution-and-were-still-in-its-shadow"&gt;The Black Death Shaped Human Evolution, And We're Still in Its Shadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, people tend to avoid consuming visibly sick animals, and therefore faunal assemblages are likely biased toward healthy animals," biologist Ian Light-Maka, of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Hermes, and their colleagues write in their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when infected animals are consumed, a single animal may infect many people, and the probability of that specific animal being found and later studied may be low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only the third time that some strain of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; has ever been found in ancient animals. The first two were a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0569"&gt;medieval rat&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06676-7"&gt;Neolithic dog&lt;/a&gt;; however, those DNA samples were too fragmented to produce reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest find is particularly exciting, Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, because the site where this sheep was found, Arkaim, is a human settlement linked to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintashta_culture"&gt;Sintashta culture&lt;/a&gt;, known for creating impressive bronze weapons, riding horses, and spreading their genes into Central Asia. These people have also been found with traces of the Late Neolithic Bronze Age (LNBA) plague strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this infected sheep lived, the Sintashta were just beginning to expand their livestock herds, since their horse-riding abilities allowed them to cover greater territory quickly, potentially increasing exposure to wild species harboring the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, it is not possible with a single genome to reconstruct a complete understanding of the ecology of the LNBA lineage across the diverse set of cultures and geographies afflicted by this prehistoric plague lineage, and our results suggest its reservoir remains at large," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;conclude.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also recommended that those who are going to be around an infant, say a grandchild, niece or godchild, get a Tdap booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies get their first shot that protects against pertussis at 2 months old, but they don’t get great protection until their second or third dose, so not until they’re 6 months or 1 year old, said Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are additional steps you can take for protection, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With whooping cough being so prevalent right now, it’s important for vaccinated people to understand they can still get mild forms of the disease. If you notice a cough or any upper respiratory illness symptoms, stay home, Wellington stressed. That’s true whether you have a cold or something more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you absolutely can’t stay home, because we all have times when there’s no options, [or] if you have to go out into public when you’re sick, wear a mask,” Wellington added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any symptoms of whooping cough (or any illness), also stay away from infants. If you suspect you have whooping cough, or your child does, talk to your doctor or pediatrician immediately. Monitoring may be necessary for infants, and there are also treatments available, Wellington noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been around someone with whooping cough, you should also let your doctor know. “We also give antibiotics to somebody who’s been exposed to pertussis and doesn’t have it yet,” Wellington explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to avoid whooping cough, if possible, which is best done through vaccination, according to Newman. The more people who are vaccinated means the less spread of the bacteria, which means healthier people and safer communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMDFUYnkyc3NMRGU1eTgxVU80ZVJzeHVhdWZDM2RMWE82UGJfa1dsYVJfOE5yLV9IT2hUelZQSHBEWUxsblFidEJaRVpULWFyTHFqYWtPSDlnM2xiOV9vT2tHNVRtWUJLa2J3cUFwSmpGZVFhTWtiNFp1YXFzeUpjcFBoLVN4TG5XQzUtYUlmc2xyNktiSlFXemQ3NV9XXzZhdnfSAacBQVVfeXFMTkxSZC01WEJPOGduWDhoLWthZjk5TUVCc3RDdjQ1eGd0N2dDMkVNLTJKOTVDT3RzeXpMTTZYdjUzejhPLXZDR01nVkFPc2d6V2VuUThJYmhneDJENUV4Z0I0bnFiUkpydXV2QUVFTzUyVFV6X0k0T2V1ck1ON204ZGpaMzVObmdDcEdLZ1FFcV9MczFZMjIyLWhtZUhRSzUyd1lLMHJUVVU</guid></item><item><title>成千上万的美国农民患有帕金森氏症。他们归咎于致命的杀虫剂。- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/thousands-of-us-farmers-have-parkinsons-they-blame-a-deadly-pesticide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content impact-article  "&gt;&lt;p class="customEmbed_01"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z2M3ANX3OVHE7AJEJ2RHC4MRFM"&gt;Paul Friday remembers when his hand started flopping in the cold weather – the first sign nerve cells in his brain were dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W2ZE2LIMJFE3ZJCXFF2QQIPBB4"&gt;He was eventually diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a brain disease that gets worse over time.

One by one, more countries followed suit.

It’s been prohibited in the United Kingdom for 18 years and China banned paraquat to “safeguard people’s life, safety and health,” in 2012, &lt;a href="http://www.chinapesticide.org.cn/eng/detail/21956" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to a government announcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-95" data-gaid="inarticle-95"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M25A354WVBEUNBJSEQMHSDZRSU"&gt;Yet about two-thirds of the paraquat imported to the U.S. between 2022 and 2024 came from companies owned by the Chinese government, SinoChem and Red Sun Group, &lt;a href="https://pesticidestorymap.com/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to a joint report&lt;/a&gt; published by three advocacy organizations in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-96" data-gaid="inarticle-96"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2Q7WICJXVVGWDDGDYDYKQIJWGQ"&gt;It found most of the 40 million and 156 million pounds imported annually over the past eight years comes from Chinese manufacturing facilities, in either China or Syngenta’s big factory in northern England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-97" data-gaid="inarticle-97"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NKJXSBUUGFAQBKWV4CYXKMVPC4"&gt;Although hundreds of companies sell paraquat, Syngenta says &lt;a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/docs/the-global-market-in-paraquat.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;it accounts for a quarter of global sales.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-98" data-gaid="inarticle-98"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XPJQ5UVY55DMHOZEDA2OGQD7MU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/chemchina-sinochem-merge-agricultural-assets-syngenta-idUSKBN1Z40HA/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;According to previous media reports&lt;/a&gt;, SinoChem, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, acquired Syngenta in a 2020 merger. SinoChem posted &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/sinochem-holdings/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;$3.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. &lt;a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Financial%20Report%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Syngenta reported&lt;/a&gt; $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-99" data-gaid="inarticle-99"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HHGMRJMUP5GU3JY3G6FGHXB7DQ"&gt;While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-100" data-gaid="inarticle-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RSBBWQ5DLJDOXLNWJQ2SRW3PVE"&gt;“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-101" data-gaid="inarticle-101"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="764KX4XJJ5GRDMKSZTE6QVPBVU"&gt;Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/paraquat" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to the Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-102" data-gaid="inarticle-102"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2Q3265P3B5G75MRS6LQ7VPOELU"&gt;“EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-103" data-gaid="inarticle-103"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="43QS4VGRE5EHPODA5PWMI53J2Y"&gt;The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-104" data-gaid="inarticle-104"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HJPUMSSU5NBHPDMFC4D5BIEY5M"&gt;“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-105" data-gaid="inarticle-105"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="34QDSAGPFFGZLJAGBAEU6DG5JA"&gt;This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-106" data-gaid="inarticle-106"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VGLT7MCGHFD2ZEWWSWWRBROO6A"&gt;For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-107" data-gaid="inarticle-107"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="quote-container"&gt;&lt;div class="impact-quote pullquote"&gt;&lt;div class="quote-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="source-attribution"&gt;Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz from EarthJustice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-108" data-gaid="inarticle-108"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2JUORFJJCJGV3FHSBIL4RL2PPM"&gt;More than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years.

Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-119" data-gaid="inarticle-119"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NE5I2W6LO5BYNNLYCBLZBHK2LY"&gt;The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0855-0554" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;agency in October&lt;/a&gt; updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-120" data-gaid="inarticle-120"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5AT4THVERJGOLMIZJSEAS63CNQ"&gt;Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again. The Trump administration this year &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/climate/from-industry-to-epa-lobbyist-now-oversees-pesticide-rules.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;put four former industry lobbyists&lt;/a&gt; or executives, from the agricultural, chemical and cleaning industries, in charge of regulating pesticides at the EPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-121" data-gaid="inarticle-121"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2BCAIDNAJRDIVHNCVNYDD3ZT3E"&gt;And while it’s not clear where the agency stands on paraquat, there has been an early sign of backing away from opposition to controversial pesticides. Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pesticides/EPA-allow-new-dicamba-herbicides/103/web/2025/07" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a different, controversial weed killer&lt;/a&gt; that had previously been banned by federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-122" data-gaid="inarticle-122"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Growing pressure to ban it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-123" data-gaid="inarticle-123"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KIE4VEVGPFAYFEAXHJ7PT74PPM"&gt;But grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-124" data-gaid="inarticle-124"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YRPVDBB45FHV3JDLWBID2RHIGY"&gt;“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-125" data-gaid="inarticle-125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YZHJ4EKKUJAJ5LD6DMQD3O7FIY"&gt;Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-126" data-gaid="inarticle-126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NIAR7O7LD5AUBDL3NLGQWZCG2Y"&gt;“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said &lt;a href="https://casar.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/casar.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/casar-paraquat-epa-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;an Oct. 7, 2024&lt;/a&gt;, letter signed by U.S. representatives.

While it remains most common in South Asia and Latin America, it’s no longer just a tropical disease. Warming temperatures are pushing dengue into southern Europe and the United States. Last year, Texas saw its &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-public-health-officials-announce-first-locally-acquired-case-dengue-virus-2024"&gt;highest case count in two decades&lt;/a&gt;, including locally acquired infections, meaning the virus is now circulating here, not just arriving with travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Dengue has no treatment.

There’s nothing for after: no antivirals — nothing like Paxlovid for Covid, or Tamiflu for the flu, or artemisinin for malaria. Once you’re sick, the strategy is just supportive care and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Earlier this month, though, that changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A new antiviral pill for dengue called mosnodenvir showed promising results in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2500179"&gt;early phase 2 trials&lt;/a&gt;. In a study where volunteers were deliberately exposed to dengue, roughly half of those who received the highest dose never got sick at all. For a field that has struggled for decades to find an effective antiviral, it’s the clearest evidence yet that a drug can prevent dengue — and researchers believe the same pill could eventually treat people who are already infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, even before the results were published, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, the American pharmaceutical giant that developed mosnodenvir, had already abandoned any efforts to bring the drug to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year J&amp;amp;J announced it would wind down its dengue antiviral work, with a “strategic reprioritization” of its research toward non-communicable diseases like cancer and obesity. What this means is that one of the most promising dengue drugs ever tested is now without a pharma sponsor, waiting for someone else to carry it forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;André Siqueira, who heads the dengue program at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), said mosnodenvir is “very, very promising” and said he wants to see it pushed into further trials “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But why — if the drug shows much promise — would its maker walk away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s exit isn’t an outlier; it’s part of a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/major-pharmaceutical-companies-dropping-antibiotic-projects-superbugs-2018-7"&gt;broader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3"&gt;retreat&lt;/a&gt; from infectious disease research across the pharmaceutical industry, as companies shift toward drugs for wealthier markets: cancer, obesity, autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dengue already &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518"&gt;kills thousands every&lt;/a&gt; year, and it’s getting worse. By 2080, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/climate/dengue-mosquito-spread-map.html"&gt;climate models suggest&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 60 percent of the world’s population could be living in areas where dengue spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, in this new world, watching the first antiviral pill that works against dengue get abandoned — while the disease spreads to new continents — reveals the gap between the drugs we need and the drugs the market will deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A worker fumigates an alleyway in a densely populated neighborhood to kill mosquitoes in the capital city of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

It’s a faster way to get answers than waiting for people to get sick naturally, but it requires volunteers willing to sign up for a controlled case of dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Among people who got the highest dose of mosnodenvir, 6 out of 10 never developed an infection at all. The other four had much lower levels of virus in their blood and milder symptoms than the placebo group, where everyone got sick. At lower doses, the drug delayed infection but didn’t prevent it — a clear signal that the higher dose was doing something real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s one of the most beautiful dose-response results I’ve seen,” Anna Durbin, the Johns Hopkins researcher who led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/antiviral-drug-abandoned-pharma-shows-promise-against-dengue"&gt;told Science last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then, there’s the field data. In 2023, J&amp;amp;J launched a trial across more than 30 sites in South America and Asia to test whether the drug could protect people in the same household who are at high risk of getting bitten by the same mosquitoes. Among 265 people who received the highest dose, not a single person developed symptomatic dengue. In the placebo group, 60 percent did. (This data hasn’t been formally peer-reviewed yet, but it’s &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05201794"&gt;posted publicly&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;The Aedes genus of mosquitos carries diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Culture Club/Bridgeman via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For Neelika Malavige, a prominent dengue researcher at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Sri Lanka, the significance goes beyond the numbers. “It’s a huge scientific breakthrough just doing the study,” she said, referring to the design of the challenge trial itself, which had never been done for a dengue antiviral before. For a disease with no approved treatment, this is as close to proof of concept as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The dengue community may be closer than ever to a long-awaited treatment,” Xuping Xie of the University of Texas Medical Branch wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2515056"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="but-there-are-some-caveats" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;But, there are some caveats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The trial proved that mosnodenvir can prevent infection, a first for any dengue drug. But prevention isn’t what dengue doctors need most. What they need is a treatment, something to give patients who are already sick to keep them from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s what makes an antiviral so valuable. Prevention strategies have a ceiling; you can reduce mosquito populations, but you can’t eliminate them, and warming temperatures keep pushing them into new territory. A drug that works &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; exposure would be the first tool that doesn’t depend on stopping the mosquito first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The hope is that the same drug could do both. Mosnodenvir works by blocking the virus from replicating, and, in theory, that should help whether you take it before you’re infected or shortly after. The question is timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s where dengue gets tricky. Unlike malaria, where the parasite lingers, and you can kill it with drugs, the dengue virus moves through the body notoriously fast. By the time a patient feels sick enough to see a doctor — usually a few days into the fever — the virus is often already on its way out. The brutal symptoms that follow, the blood vessel leakage and organ damage, are driven largely by the body’s own immune response, not the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a global health reporter, this story felt grimly familiar. The things we pay attention to get solved, and so-called neglected tropical diseases have become something that just happens elsewhere. It’s the reason why tuberculosis is still the deadliest infectious disease and why it took 35 years to develop the first malaria vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This line from a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/magazine/what-the-world-needs-now-is-ddt.html"&gt;2004 article&lt;/a&gt; captures this quite well: “Probably the worst thing that ever happened to malaria in poor nations was its eradication in rich ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;I grew up in Mumbai, where dengue was a regular occurrence every monsoon season. But the disease isn’t staying there anymore. It’s spreading — into southern Europe, into the United States — and the question of who develops drugs for it is no longer someone else’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is why antivirals have been so hard to develop for dengue. The window to intervene can be narrow, and for many patients, it’s already closing by the time they show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scientists who developed mosnodenvir believe it could work as a treatment. “If you reduce the amount of replicating virus, you will also reduce the likelihood that the patient evolves towards severe disease,” said Johan Neyts, a virologist at KU Leuven whose lab co-discovered the drug. The logic is in line with how antivirals for, say Covid, work, but this hypothesis hasn’t been tested in humans. Treatment trials were planned in Singapore, but the Covid pandemic made them impossible. By the time restrictions lifted, J&amp;amp;J had already decided to exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The dream, Malavige said, is simple, “You go to the doctor, get yourself tested, the test is positive, you’re given an antiviral, and that’s the end of the story.” The question is whether patients can get there early enough — and whether mosnodenvir can work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s also the question of resistance. In the human challenge trial, genetic mutations emerged in the virus among nearly all the participants who took mosnodenvir — mutations that could, in theory, make the drug less effective over time. And some dengue strains already circulating in nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52819-z"&gt;appear to be harder to treat&lt;/a&gt; with this type of drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is a real limitation. Mosnodenvir alone probably isn’t a long-term solution, because, eventually, the virus might adapt. But that problem is a familiar one for drug makers. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-drug-resistance"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1403340"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; both evolved resistance to early drugs, and the answer was combination therapy: multiple drugs that attack the virus in different ways, making it far harder to escape all of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For that strategy to work with dengue, though, we need more drugs to combine. Mosnodenvir may not be the whole puzzle, but it could be the first piece. “If people stopped at the first sign of seeing trouble,” Malavige said, “then the world will not progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="could-mosnodenvirget-adopted" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Could Mosnodenvir…get adopted? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s exit follows a well-worn path for big pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the past two decades, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01528.x#:~:text=By%202005%2C%20the%20number%20of,on%20developing%20new%20antimicrobial%20drugs."&gt;Bristol Myers Squibb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/despite-looming-resistance-crisis-novartis-ducks-out-antibiotics-research"&gt;Novartis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://centest.acs.org/articles/93/i10/AstraZeneca-Spin-Off-Antibiotics.html"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/a&gt;, and other major drugmakers have all scaled back or abandoned infectious disease research, judging that these drugs simply couldn’t compete with cancer and obesity blockbusters. A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e9bd070-a99e-4f1f-bff9-3709007104e1"&gt;recent op-ed in the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; called it a “textbook market failure.” The public health impact is massive, but the financial returns for addressing them aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After J&amp;amp;J’s exit, ownership of mosnodenvir is being transferred back to KU Leuven, the Belgian university where the drug was first discovered before J&amp;amp;J licensed it for development. “We will do all we can to make sure that mosnodenvir is further developed in clinical trials as soon as possible,” said Patrick Chaltin, who directs the university’s drug discovery center. To do that, the university is working with the Wellcome Trust, a major global health funder, to find new partners and funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And fortunately, mosnodenvir isn’t the only dengue drug that the pharmaceutical industry is looking into. The Swiss drug maker Novartis is running a phase 2 treatment trial for a different antiviral, and the Serum Institute in India is testing a monoclonal antibody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Drug development is expensive and uncertain, and the people who need dengue treatments most are not the people who can pay the most. But these steps are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In countries where dengue has always circulated — India, Brazil, the Philippines, Sri Lanka — people have learned to live around it, says Malavige. Life bends around when the mosquitoes are biting, and then bends back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;But dengue isn’t locked in those places anymore. Warmer temperatures are carrying the mosquitoes — and the virus — somewhere new every year. And there’s no sign that this expansion is slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNR3U1OElpMzkzNm16NEktbzFJYzhfZTN0S2VBYlR6eUN0dDBNUklib3JPWXBWS2ZiRW9LTHhVY1VtVTgyemhwdWwtRG5wdWw1dnhDc2M1RGdoMWdYTkhWdmV5V3N5aVkxZVlhX1JzVVZpOGpEekloVnd0OWFyRkp5ai1vcTF1Uzhfa05lTXFZc1ExMEtiMmVkTGN6WDl2cEl1QnZoTTNpbWVyZUlBZjhYcTZIV01lM2IxZV9iVndzNkxBQQ</guid></item><item><title>研究显示， COVID-19疫苗与降低任何原因导致的死亡风险相关- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/12/15/people-vaccinated-against-covid-19-have-lower-risk-of-death-regardless-of-the-cause-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[�'EE퇏B���FԤ)���n �b��N�����}����D}x��)"��̘��%ۺ�e�%���$�F ����9W]�_�\_�_�Z�+�^a�K�����9%���5��%�ڽY�I� �=� ��h�ܕ�џ_������$�8I�sAb��F�b�\�����������np�YV5�1����p�4�8��[Rn�	B)Tl]�Dy����##i'�&amp;lt;�B�կ,�7��ɀ�u��&amp;amp;a ����{�9��z\U-mT	b��Q�5nQ:�e����Z� (�����1�٧���V�Ѱ�;c��������7���_���U�*ݟ�OD�8p�[P]�B�I�$�J�S��P��^�[�� �"�h��H���Ɵ�KB*��8s��Y�����Z��2

The latest plant-based hydration beverage on the market is being touted as “the peel good beverage” that offers “a bunch of nutrients.” And it’s drumming up attention on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boyfriend says it has aromatics of slightly overripe banana,” one Reddit user, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/leemoongrass/" target="_blank"&gt;leemoongrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Volumeeating/comments/1asn7px/my_boyfriend_just_came_home_with_this_lmao/?rdt=52704" target="_blank"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “It honestly isn’t that bad.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It smells like baby food,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQXGmLvD9x_/" target="_blank"&gt;lsp2c&lt;/a&gt; said on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with banana water for plants, a DIY fertilizer made by soaking banana peels in water to extract nutrients, such as potassium and vitamin C, for your flora. Or homemade banana drinks, such as hot water &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/270779/hot-banana-water/" target="_blank"&gt;steeped with banana peels&lt;/a&gt; and strained, or blended banana smoothies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new drink, sold in supermarkets, is being marketed as an alternative to sports drinks, a sort of coconut water 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some have taken to social media with questions: “How do you think you juice a banana?!” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tybottofficial/video/7504810072766188830" target="_blank"&gt;tybottofficial&lt;/a&gt; asked on TikTok, while unpacking a box of organic banana water from Woodstock. “I wonder if they’re just in a factory, like, you know, really milking these bananas, I guess?” (He gave the drink a 7.5 out of 10.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.woodstock-foods.com/the-goods/product.organic-banana-water-042563018771.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://banagua.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Banagua&lt;/a&gt;, leading manufacturers of banana water, make their banana water in Thailand from organic “Thai golden” and “Thai cultivated” bananas, which are shorter and stubbier-looking than the standard yellow bananas sold in most American supermarkets and which have a slight pinkish tint. The fruit gets pinker in the processing and the drink has a pinkish hue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a label ogler, the ingredient list will put you at ease. Banana water contains just one ingredient: bananas. There’s no significant water added to it. A banana is 80% water, Banagua co-founder Rob Smithson says, and the processing of the drink (an “enzymatic process”) separates the water from the pulp — the drink is slightly viscous but not pulpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodstock’s bananas are steamed and mashed with “proprietary enzymes” to release nutrients. “Think of it as liquefied bananas,” says Bruce Bruemmer,  vice president of brand management at UNFI Brands+, Woodstock’s parent company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot? Both companies say their banana water is especially healthy, brimming with electrolytes like potassium, B6 and magnesium, as well as minerals and antioxidants such as vitamin A and C. The drink has no added sugar, and zero fat, sodium and cholesterol, though a 330ml can does have about 13 grams of carbohydrates, slightly less than Naked coconut water’s 14 grams in a container of the same size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how healthy &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; banana water, what does it taste like, and is it worth the hype? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manufacturer’s claims:&lt;/b&gt; “Our banana water has 205 mg of magnesium — 50% of the daily value,” Smithson says of Banagua’s Original Banana, which went on the market in July 2025. “And it’s especially hydrating — probably 2-3 bananas per can, which you can bring anywhere and you don’t have to worry about moldy bananas. And just 50 calories — Naked’s coconut water has 60.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodstock’s 500ml can of banana water, which went on the market in March 2024, has just 80 calories. “Our Woodstock Organic Banana Water stands out for its great taste and natural hydration,” Bruemmer says, “delivering 765mg of electrolytes — similar to many sports drinks — without any artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutritionists’ take:&lt;/b&gt; “It’s probably a sequel to coconut water,” says &lt;a class="link" href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014Re56AAC/thomas-g-sherman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Thomas Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University Medical Center. “It would appeal to people who are worried about animal wellness and saturated fat in their milk drinks or who are worried about too high sugar — so this fits the bill. But I question its effectiveness — these types of beverages offer such trivial amounts of electrolytes compared to what’s already in our food. And it’s expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherman says that, in the end, it comes down to the consumer’s intentions for choosing banana water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re buying it because of the taste, and you want to support a plant-based beverage, and [because] it’s fairly low sugar, then fine,” he says. “But if you’re buying it because you’re interested in getting more potassium and magnesium and calcium with low sodium, then it’s silly because just &lt;i&gt;eat plants&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eat food&lt;/i&gt;, that’s going to supply hundreds of times more potassium and calcium and magnesium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorizing banana water as a sports drink is problematic, adds &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" target="_blank"&gt;Vanessa King&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist specializing in supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sports drinks replace electrolytes,” King says. “The problem with banana water is that while bananas are very high in potassium, the electrolyte that you predominantly lose when you exercise is sodium — and it doesn’t provide sodium. I would not choose it over a sports drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King points out that “banana juice,” as she calls it, suffers from the same concerns as other juices: “It’s more concentrated sugar without the fiber you’d get from the fruit version.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any amount of potassium, magnesium, vitamin A and C — all key nutrients in banana water — is helpful, King says. “They’re  all nutrients that are generally under-consumed by Americans. But bananas also have those nutrients!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The taste: &lt;/b&gt;We found it sweet and tropical-tasting, slightly viscous but surprisingly refreshing. However, we didn’t go bananas for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: &lt;/b&gt;Banagua’s Original Banana (330ml): $3.49; Woodstock’s Organic Banana Water (500ml): $2.99.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9JdEkxdUZseDNoN0dEcEVPNTFyV1h3bnFZRWdrUWU1bV9TejFqdWRlSE0zcXNlOThuQ05JQ3BsSDN3Y0hEdzRXZE14Y2xUV1JtRlplUTNybHRtZFRNU0NhWGdVZzJjdTRnR2xERkwyVmx4YzM0eEprMEpiTEM2dw</guid></item><item><title>列|我是一名医生。以下是我推荐的对抗炎症的11种食物。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/12/15/foods-that-fight-inflammation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G22IUVOO5VHUVJJ4PKFJ73BJ4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are anti-inflammatory diets backed by science?

Behaviors that would instantly annoy us in people, like loud chewing, often become endearing when a dog does the exact same thing. That mindset is on full display in a video where a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Barney’s crunchy eating habit becomes the highlight rather than the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s loud chewing is just perfect for dog owner in this video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pet ASMR has steadily grown in popularity online, and Barney’s video fits right into that trend. In the short clip, the Golden Retriever is seen happily munching on carrots, producing loud, rhythmic crunching sounds as he eats. His chewing is steady and enthusiastic, clearly showing how much he enjoys his snack. Rather than finding the noise distracting, his owner finds it completely endearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The text displayed on the video sums up the moment perfectly. It reads, “I would lose my mind if a human ate like this… but my dog doing it? Perfection.” The contrast struck a chord with viewers, many of whom agreed that dogs somehow get a free pass for habits that would otherwise be irritating. Barney’s focus and contentment while chewing only add to the charm, making the sound oddly calming instead of overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some viewers said watching a dog eat is one of life’s simple pleasures, while others described the sound as “soul soothing.” One commenter joked that the chewing was so satisfying it could be used as a “ringtone,” while another summed things up by saying anything their own dog does feels perfect too. Many agreed that there’s something uniquely comforting about watching pets enjoy small moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond the satisfying sounds, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-health/dog-food-dog-nutrition/84309-can-dogs-eat-carrots" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carrots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt; themselves are a healthy option for many dogs. Veterinarians often recommend them as a low-calorie snack rich in fiber and vitamins, such as beta-carotene, which supports eye health. Crunchy vegetables can also help promote dental health by reducing plaque buildup. As with any treat, moderation is key, and carrots should be cut into appropriate sizes to avoid choking. For Barney, they seem to be both a nutritious choice and a source of pure happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/199258-golden-retriever-dog-loud-chew-video-instagram" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Owner Says Golden Retriever’s Loud Chewing Is ‘Perfection’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Owner Says Golden Retriever’s Loud Chewing Is ‘Perfection’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:33:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOeG01SWljdWYzMnBkODlNUEFsNnZ4eHdPZVNfdjhkSTFaVUltUkVVdEJHbkkwQW5vVzZhdW03MUJpd192OTNqQ1JCVWw3QmlWZGlXZGltUW1OX3A3eXJ2aTMzc0pQcUlVZEpRM0RScVdfZWZ2cWlHOU5BUFVvSDI4MHhlM3lzVU44MWRKbmF0RXBzSTA</guid></item><item><title>什么是痛风，为什么痛风呈上升趋势？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/well/live/gout-pain-treatment-recovery.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNQmR0VlBsMlFVR2lSVWk5RmM2T0UwaENKTFFaTUxVTV9HNUpaUm0zVWtDRkxVME15VElCZzFiTEZLWk0weHJGZVY1UDlKaWlFREFOeWcwcXpVdGVhbERwT08wa2dZVmh3UU56UnhJZW5OOXNDc01ydWtCNFNuOHhYTi01NVM</guid></item><item><title>想在2026年拥有更健康的大脑吗？报名参加Well的5天挑战赛。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/well/mind/brain-health-challenge-sign-up.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQYjhTYUNwajg5Yk41SDlKVDhEZlpySFREamVUcXVzQlREVm1kMmI4TGJGNVY0QnJrS2I4TDNEQ1pMay1VSjQtczY4RzZ4YXlxNGlQa1NmdUlsb3htZVBXZzk2cF9ybTEtMjlva2t4THU3ajVzME8xWGtKYk1DbVFQZ1liejlsdFU</guid></item><item><title>合成染料亚甲基蓝的健康宣称背后是什么？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/15/nx-s1-5634680/methylene-blue-supplement-safety</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Wellness enthusiasts seeking to hack their way to health and longevity have a new favorite remedy — one that &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahlawuk/video/7140354795554213125?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZP-92AJZMNpvag" target="_blank"&gt;stains their tongues blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue has been around since the 1870s when it was used as a textile dye. Since then it's been prescribed as an antimalarial treatment and an antidote for cyanide poisoning. Today it's&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as treatment for methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But online influencers are promoting it for what they claim are its wellness properties. It's taking off among biohackers, who seek to optimize their health via lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pifmGCPjluM" target="_blank"&gt;Commentators speculated&lt;/a&gt; that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes methylene blue after a video of the nation's top health official circulated early this year. He can be seen using an eyedropper to mix a cobalt blue liquid into a cup of water. Kennedy never confirmed what he was taking, though the vibrant color and applicator resembles the methylene blue products that are sold by online retailers. And Kennedy's known for &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/rfk-jr-takes-his-vitamins-but-this-vitamin-industry-ceo-isnt-sure-hes-an-ally-00476806" target="_blank"&gt;taking supplements&lt;/a&gt;, and has a track record of embracing debunked or unproven scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Claim:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue improves the function of mitochondria — components of our cells which convert nutrients into energy — and that results in a host of benefits, such as slowed aging, better mood and sharper cognition. Some even claim it alleviates jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab studies and animal trials have found that methylene blue can help cells make energy more efficiently by giving mitochondria an easier way to move electrons when their normal pathways are damaged or stressed, says Lorne Hofseth, who studies dyes' effect on cancer and inflammation at the University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He also cites studies done in rodents and worms to show that methylene blue improves brain energy use, reduces inflammation, and protects against neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to research in humans, there have been several smaller trials in select populations that have shown antidepressant or cognitive benefits from pure methylene blue. But Hofseth says these findings remain preliminary — which is why he strongly discourages people from taking it as a supplement, as right now, the risks outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You're wasting your money," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean methylene blue is a total scientific dead end. Hofseth points to promising work being done in the UK on a modified form of the dye to treat Alzheimer's disease. But this methylene blue is different from the dye people are purchasing as an over the counter supplement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So why might online influencers feel convinced that methylene blue makes them feel better and think faster?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Cognition is subjective," says Nicole Brandt, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy who studies geriatric pharmacotherapy. "We have good and bad days if we sleep well, if we eat well."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to wasting money, Hofseth and Brandt both warn of adverse side effects from methylene blue. That includes serotonin toxicity, which is a serious drug reaction, which can cause elevated blood pressure, diarrhea, seizures, and even death: People who take certain antidepressants, including Zoloft and Lexapro, are especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4091817/" target="_blank"&gt;could also be dangerous for&lt;/a&gt; people who have a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/" target="_blank"&gt;genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; affecting red blood cells called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another concern is people may not know what they're getting when they buy methylene blue over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really don't have good oversight, or any oversight to nutritional supplements and what's in them," Brandt says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike drugs, supplements are not approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy before they go on the market. But they do have to follow certain rules around labeling. Manufacturers are also subject to inspection, and the FDA monitors safety concerns once products are on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, federal regulators have finite resources and are unable to catch every bad actor, says Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former principal deputy commissioner at the FDA. That's why he says it's buyer beware with methylene blue, and similar products&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The internet is a big place," he told NPR. "There are a lot of products for sale that are not safe."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also not clear whether methylene blue meets the regulatory definition of a supplement. It's listed in an FDA database as a generic drug that requires a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And most methylene blue products are not in a federal registry of dietary supplement labels, according to Jeff Ventura, vice president for communications at the Council for Responsible Nutrition. Many of the products seen online are not explicitly identified as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA did not respond to a request for comment about how it's possible for online retailers to sell methylene blue without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who still want to try methylene blue should first talk to a clinician to ensure they're not at risk for adverse side effects. And if someone's taking methylene blue for a specific health concern, like brain fog or fatigue, a primary care provider can also help address those issues, says Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you do decide to try the product, be warned: It could turn your teeth, tongue and urine bright blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A few years ago, researchers at labs and companies reported they had engineered viruses that could ferry corrective genes deep into the brain, giving potential entry to a new world of treatments for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and a slew of rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This summer, after years of careful study, the first person underwent gene therapy using one of the new viruses. The patient, a young child, died two and a half days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The death has sent concern and uncertainty rippling through labs and companies developing gene therapies for the brain, along with rare disease groups who hoped these tools could deliver long-sought cures. They worry that Capsida Biotherapeutics unearthed a broader risk for other viruses designed to travel like a messenger pigeon to our brains, one that could derail years of progress. &lt;/p&gt;

Eat gut-friendly foods &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/is-fibermaxxing-new-protein-goals-asked-nutrition-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;foods with a lot of fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber should be removed from your gut or eaten in lower amounts. "These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites.

If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the pH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="c876917b-a21c-44df-9743-beeb169eaa5b" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has its own method of action."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking them for bowel regularity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever your problem is," she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="90970c8c-7c40-4c77-9db1-2c50c03fa448" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a data-id="74795062-398a-4c91-a327-5038c8b42238" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are small ways you can get your body in the habit of moving every day or at least more frequently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too. So, if we eat when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to process the nutrients of our food properly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, including exercising or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which affect our gut health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 09:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVDg5NlJkY3RId2RsdVJDOFA2VlNVdmVadjJPalZjdVNuc3hNenNjQ0gxaUlJa0J5bkRCVkJqZ2NWUHpzTi1nR1Q0a09OZ2RPT3hITlRuMkJYaHotYXNWdHR0emlQNUh4WUdsdFRBbTIzMW1tLW5fSkZaVTVvV2FhczZmTzRmaTNnbVlHX3Vn</guid></item><item><title>凯拉什医院心脏病专家分享了心脏健康的最佳饮食红旗： “吃太多腌菜，手帕......” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kailash-hospital-cardiologist-shares-top-diet-red-flags-for-heart-health-too-much-pickle-papad-raises-blood-pressure-101765782616719.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/kailash-hospital-cardiologist-shares-top-diet-red-flags-for-heart-health-too-much-pickle-papad-raises-blood-pressure-101765782616719.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;With half of the last month of 2025 already gone and 2026 just a fortnight away, it's the perfect time to reconsider your lifestyle habits so you can modify them and begin the year with a positive note and healthy lifestyle habits.&lt;/span&gt; One of the most preliminary lifestyle changes you can make is improving your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/adding-avocado-to-diet-5-delicious-recipes-to-try-creamy-spaghetti-greek-farm-salad-crab-stuffed-avocado-and-more-101757408211556.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;What you eat has a very significant impact on your heart, and given how heart diseases are on the rise in India, it is the need of the hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/15/550x309/pickles_1765784984759_1765784984910.jpg" alt="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/15/550x309/pickles_1765784984759_1765784984910.jpg" alt="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-hospital-cardiologist-reveals-4-sleeping-habits-for-good-heart-health-no-caffeine-after-2-pm-and-more-101762690120166.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Apollo Hospital cardiologist reveals 4 sleeping habits for good heart health: No caffeine after 2 PM and more"&gt;Apollo Hospital cardiologist reveals 4 sleeping habits for good heart health: No caffeine after 2 PM and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To understand how you can take better precautions and know if your diet is a green/red flag for your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-how-a-39-year-old-man-christmas-party-indulgence-ended-with-severe-heart-failure-101765785015746.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health, HT Lifestyle spoke to Dr Sunil Kumar Mandal, consultant cardiologist at Kailash Hospital, Greater Noida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why is it imperative to pay attention to what's on your plate? As per the cardiologist, there's an alarming rise in heart diseases. “Indians are developing heart diseases nearly 10–15 years earlier than most Western populations,” Dr Mandal said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the hidden risks in the modern Indian diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat may seem harmless, and even staple in the Indian diet, but it may quietly be putting your heart at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mandal warned against excessively deep-fried food in oil. “&lt;span&gt;Excessive intake of saturated and trans fats is one particular concern. High intakes of ghee, butter, and vanaspati with frequent consumption of fried snacks such as samosas, pakoras, and puris result in high bad cholesterol levels.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates are again a part of everyday meals, from morning to night. But there's a big risk in eating them daily, as they put stress on your heart through repeated insulin spikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist elaborated, “White rice, maida-containing bread, and sweet preparations are responsible for hyperglycemic spikes, leading subsequently to insulin resistance and predisposing towards diabetes and cardiac problems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sodium and irregular patterns also contribute to many heart problems. Dr Mandal warned about favourites like pickles and papads.&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;“Eating too much pickles, papads, packaged chutneys, and processed snacks leads to high intake of sodium adds to this burden by raising blood pressure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also need to be careful about the timing of your meals, as eating erratically may increase stress on the cardiovascular system. Similarly, large portions can have the same effect, according to the cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What should you eat for healthy heart?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/21/550x309/walnut_1761018345598_1761018345838.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat a handful of nuts and seeds to improve your heart health.

(Picture credit: Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what should you instead prioritise for better heart health? The cardiologist urged focusing on a balanced diet. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mandal elaborated on the nutrients, “Your plate should be colourful and rich in fruits, vegetables, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fish, to provide nutrients, antioxidants, and fibre that will keep your heart functioning optimally.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that you need to substitute? Yes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mandal shared, “Substitute unhealthy fats with healthy fats to keep our heart healthy and regularly switch to the use of whole grains, in place of refined grain products, like whole wheat, brown rice, millet, etc&lt;/span&gt;, to keep our cholesterol down and stabilise our blood sugar level.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the cooking method, Dr Mandal strongly recommended going for steaming, baking, and roasting instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, he also reiterated the importance of portion control, noting that eating smaller portions helps keep the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

He notes, “Whoever invented the term morning sickness is a filthy liar. There's nothing mourning about it. It's more like 24/7 life sickness. The worst subscription service you never signed up for.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the surgeon adds that, somewhat ironically, morning sickness has been linked to better pregnancy outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He explains that preliminary research suggests nausea and vomiting are associated with a lower risk of pregnancy loss and improved foetal outcomes, although the evidence has limitations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Rajan explains, “This may be because morning sickness correlates with a higher level of hCG, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, as well as oestrogen and progesterone. All these hormones are associated with a well-developing placenta. And all of these hormones are associated with nausea pathways in the brain and/or gut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nausea hacks that might help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Rajan shares some strategies that helped his pregnant wife manage morning sickness, which she experienced predominantly during her first trimester. He suggests, “Bland food like toast or crackers first thing in the morning actually helps since nausea is worsened by an empty stomach. Similarly, nibbling something edible periodically and grazing with smaller, more frequent meals was more helpful than three larger meals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also highlights ginger as an effective way to manage morning sickness, along with certain anti-nausea supplements. The surgeon recommends, “Ginger in tea form, candy chews, or even raw help, because the gingerol chemicals have a GI effect.

Once considered an older person's disease, cardiovascular causes are striking younger adults who often appear healthy just moments before collapsing suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a one-year autopsy-based study from AIIMS, it was found that more than half of all sudden deaths in this age group were due to heart-related problems, the major killers being CAD along with other cardiovascular conditions. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom before death, often leaving families in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular report carries much significance, as it advocates for a better level of awareness regarding heart disease, especially in seemingly healthy persons. The early recognition of subtle and atypical warning signs can save lives. Whereas the classic symptoms of a heart attack, like sharp chest pain, are well-known to all, in many young adults, these atypical warning signs do not appear serious on the face of it. Early detection and timely intervention make all the difference — it saves lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 03:47:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“36小时脂肪燃烧”和冲刺背后的真相-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/the-truth-behind-36-hours-of-fat-burning-and-sprinting/articleshow/125968818.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity sprints can increase your metabolism and fat burn for many hours. At one glance, it seems like another one of those overstated fitness promises. However, unlike other viral videos, this one does have some valid backing from science. It is not a question of whether it is true, but of what it is conveying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No fat is melted by sprinting for a day and a half. What actually happens is much more useful as well as interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is sprinting different than regular cardio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinting is an intensive activity that tests the body to its limits. Within a few seconds, heart rate accelerates, ventilation increases, and major muscle group activation occurs. Such intensive exercises compel the body to work with energy that is metabolized quickly but inefficiently by the body, causing stress that the body tries to correct afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 morning drinks that melt belly fat and shrink the waist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While jogging or walking is a process of aerobics, sprinting is more anaerobic. Anaerobic systems produce energy quickly. This is what creates a higher energy debt that must be repaid by burning calories after the session is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the 36 hour effect&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After such strenuous physical activity, it does not return to its normal state easily. Instead, it remains engaged in efforts to restore oxygen levels, repair muscle tissues, remove metabolic wastes, as well as rebalance hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase is called Excess Post Exercise Oxygen Consumption or EPOC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies that were printed in the likes of the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12567725/#:~:text=Excess%20post%2Dexercise%20oxygen%20consumption%20(EPOC)%20is%20significantly,the%20volume%20of%20muscle%20recruitment%20%5B%207%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology and Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have found that intense exercises can increase resting energy levels for as long as 24 to 36 hours. This is dependent upon the intensity of the exercises, total efforts, fitness levels, and recovery conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this phase, metabolic rates are higher than usual even at rest. Both fat, carbohydrates, and proteins work collectively for energy release. This is where the term “fat burning for 36 hours” originates from, despite being a bit too simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science actually suggests&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research comparing sprint intervals to moderate aerobic activities demonstrates a more significant metabolic response after the exercise for sprinting. In one study in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1995688/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;European Journal of Applied Physiology,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;it was found that shorter bursts of sprinting triggered a more substantial afterburn effect than longer endurance exercises despite shorter total exercise times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A body of research also identifies enhanced insulin sensitivity with sprint training. Improved insulin regulation translates to the body becoming more adept at dealing with glucose levels, reducing the possibility of fat accumulation from excess calories. This, in turn, leads to positive body composition without necessarily engaging in weight loss or gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also the role of hormonal responses. In sprinting, there is the elevation of adrenaline levels as well as noradrenaline, which is attributed to the breakdown of fat. These hormones continue to be high even after training, contributing to the additional burning of calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this does not mean for fat loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A degree of realism is in order here. One sprint session will never produce enough fat loss for you to actually see it. This is true even with the extra calorie burn that occurs during recovery. This is important to understand about fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinting is more effective as it is incorporated into a balanced regimen that includes proper eating, weight training, and resting. If any of these factors are missing, no amount of vigorous exercise is effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should be careful when sprinting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinting is a demanding activity for the joints, tendons, and nervous system. It is not advisable for either beginners or injured persons to immediately engage in maximal-effort sprinting, as this could enhance the risk of injury. Research suggests that gradual progression is advisable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of people would potentially get the same metabolic benefits through modified intervals or intensive cycling.Sprinting can stimulate metabolism for as long as 36 hours by placing additional recovery demands on the body. This is an indirect way of fat loss that does not occur instantly. Science explains the process, not the magic. When sprinting is utilized effectively, it is a great productivity tool. When it is pitched as a fix for one event, it totally misses the point. That still requires repetition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 01:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxNVGphSFNrVGRHTzZrZU5RTHVGazNZNjVrRmV1cUVFNmJKNk9TTG1hR2hqN3JKSUEzaHlTSFZQMWxCYkJUeHM5LUFVR21Uc2VmQy1CQ2k4a0FIWThkUHVYTFdnQlFpZmU5TGtDSkIwUFZ3MllTcXAycGkxcW9hcHhpNDJvMkRCZ1RyQ01nb0hhdU5QN0VYcGdrZ2ZxS3JhbGdvOEdwaWprRE5zWDQzMXNPNWxBalVNYkZnZVVGZGhSVjdTbW9JU0xWNnhBcXdQdmM3VXBHNjdyc25CQQ</guid></item><item><title>专家解释如何为英国“超级流感”浪潮做好准备- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-explains-how-to-prepare-for-wave-of-uk-super-flu</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The NHS is facing severe pressure this winter as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="185473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; cases surge earlier than usual, with some calling it "super flu".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about this year's flu season and how to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is 'super flu'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Meghana Pandit, NHS national medical director, &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "With record demand for A&amp;amp;E and ambulances and an impending resident doctors strike, this unprecedented wave of super flu is leaving the NHS facing a worst-case scenario for this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-first-death-from-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-reported-in-us"&gt;World's First Death From H5N5 Bird Flu Strain Reported in US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this term has now been repeated frequently in the media, it was not intended as a new scientific designation. Although the flu season began early, both the spread of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="185473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; and the severity of illness remain within what experts consider normal for a flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="185473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="185473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; are constantly evolving to evade our immune system, which is why the flu vaccine must be updated regularly. Some years the virus mutates more than others, and it typically undergoes a major change every &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15218094/"&gt;four to five years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "subtype" of flu that is dominant this year, called influenza A/H3N2, has been around since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7144439/"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, and there have been over a dozen such changes in that time. By this definition, we see "super flu" every few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is the situation in the UK really as bad as some headlines suggest?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation isn't unprecedented – it falls within the range of what scientists would expect in a bad flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185494" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/person_with_flu_642.jpg" alt="person with the flu on a couch " class="wp-image-185494 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/person_with_flu_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/person_with_flu_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185494" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The winter flu season in the UK might be bad, but it's not unprecedented.

In fact, the situation is comparable to previous years after taking the early season start into account, as a &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17704679"&gt;recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which areas of the UK are worst affected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important consideration from a public health perspective is the burden on healthcare systems in different regions, which is determined by what the virus is doing and what resources are available in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data only provides general infection trends at regional levels. England's influenza season started &lt;a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-respiratory-covid-19/"&gt;earlier than in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/immunisation-and-vaccines/fluvaccine/weekly-influenza-and-acute-respiratory-infection-report/"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/services-and-teams/public-health-services/health-protection/surveillance-data/respiratory-0"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, so we might expect the situation to turn earlier in England than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2025-to-2026-season"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for England from the UK Health Security Agency, the north and the Midlands are possibly experiencing higher flu rates – but not significantly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are we seeing more flu cases in younger people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and teens are more likely to get infected due to their high contact rates in schools, where a lot of spread happens, and also because their immune systems are less experienced at dealing with flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults are less likely to become infected overall, as they typically have lower contact rates and their immune systems have &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002864"&gt;more experience with influenza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, people over 64 are more likely to have existing health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness if they do become infected, and their immune systems have started to weaken in a process called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8023351/"&gt;immunosenescence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies are also at greater risk of severe illness &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26702035/"&gt;as their immune systems are still undeveloped&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People of a similar age tend to have been infected with &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010317"&gt;similar flu viruses&lt;/a&gt;, which might explain why certain age groups are more affected by flu than others in some seasons. It might be that the virus this year happens to have found an immunity gap in children that isn't present in other age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is lower for older people, so should they still get the jab?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data shows that the flu vaccine reduces the risk of being hospitalised with flu by about &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;30 to 40%&lt;/a&gt; in older people.

Children are around 70 to 75% less likely to attend or be admitted to hospital with flu if vaccinated, and, as mentioned above, adults are around 30 to 40% less likely to attend or be admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are offered a nasal spray, whereas adults are given an injection. Studies have shown that the nasal spray vaccine works better in children and less well in adults, which is why the recommendations are different. So one reason for the difference is that we are comparing estimates from different vaccines as well as different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason is differences in existing immunity. Adults have already been exposed to many flu viruses over their lives, so the incremental gain of one extra vaccine is probably smaller – but still beneficial – than for a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should I do if I think I've caught it: call 111, stay home, or go to A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay home if you are sick, rest, and take sensible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to others. Getting influenza is very unpleasant, but everyone will get it roughly &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002864"&gt;once every five years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority of cases, people get better on their own. But you should still follow the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/"&gt;NHS guidelines&lt;/a&gt; regarding seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there test kits (lateral flow) I can buy at the pharmacy, as there were for COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, very similar tests exist for the flu, and you can buy these at pharmacies and online. Although it's interesting to know if it's influenza or some other virus that is making you sick, if you have flu symptoms, the advice is the same regardless of which virus caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it too late to get the vaccine – given that it takes two weeks for the vaccine to properly kick in?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it's not too late, and the sooner the better! Even after the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="185473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; has peaked, it will take a few months before cases reach low levels again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still a risk of infection in that time, so any extra protection from the vaccine is still helpful.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271959/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is still chipping away at one of the biggest public-health wins of the last century: the widespread use of disease-eradicating vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 5, his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/10/us-news/rfk-jr-ousts-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee/"&gt;handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; tossed the recommendation for universal hepatitis B vaccines for infants at birth, instead advising it only for babies whose mothers tested positive for the disease — and recommending that babies who don’t get the jab at birth don’t receive it earlier than two months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But . . . why?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hep B vaccine has a stellar safety record, and relying on testing is a bad plan; it’s usually done in the first trimester or during birth, but can go wrong in plenty of ways — like moms being exposed post-test, or not getting tested at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universal at-birth vaccination is a low-risk,&lt;em&gt; very &lt;/em&gt;effective strategy for preventing a disease that has a 90% chance of becoming a chronic, liver-damaging, possibly deadly illness for babies who get infected. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry: Who wants &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; kids with hep B? &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;em&gt;zero &lt;/em&gt;reason for the ACIP to change recommendations,&lt;em&gt; except&lt;/em&gt; to further RFK’s obsessive agenda to reduce the number of vaccines for tots — based&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/opinion/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-fixation-is-a-menace-to-public-health/"&gt; on his feverish belief that the jabs are dangerous.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The White House is, at the very least, giving him a long leash to carry out his anti-vax campaign. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same day as the ACIP’s hepatitis B decision, President Donald Trump signed a memo directing a review of the vaccine schedules of “peer, developed countries,” noting that places like Denmark, Germany and Japan recommend fewer early childhood vaccines than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s because Japan, Germany and Denmark are smaller countries with entirely different health-care systems and disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the way, the rate of chickenpox in Denmark — frequently praised by anti-vaxxers for its sparse vaccine schedule — is sky-high compared to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s all part and parcel of RFK Jr.’s dangerous and &lt;em&gt;plain dumb &lt;/em&gt;war on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the CDC &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-ordered-cdc-language-change-on-vaccines-autism-not-supported-by-science/"&gt;updated its vaccine safety section&lt;/a&gt; to read that: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism” — when in fact the claim that vaccines &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; cause autism &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2010/02/03/vaccine-autistic-link-kod/"&gt;has been thoroughly shredded.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;

		

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And on Dec. 10, the FDA announced that it’s “rigorously reviewing” the safety of the RSV vaccine for infants, despite a complete lack of reported safety issues — and the fact that the virus is consistently the leading cause of hospitalization for infants.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Objective, evidence-based safety checks are a good thing, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;public-health agencies under &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; secretary have been anything but objective when it comes to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Terrifying young parents by suggesting, based on debunked nonsense, that vaxxing their kids could ruin their health forever when the opposite is true isn’t just mind-bogglingly irresponsible, it’s downright &lt;em&gt;cruel.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly what the public-health bureaucracy under RFK Jr. is doing every time it casts doubt on vaccines that are &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ugly truth: The only end result will be more sick and dead kids. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the rapid advances in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the humble human brain still has the edge over computers in its ability to transfer skills and learn across tasks. A new study reveals how we likely do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Princeton University, the researchers behind the new study didn't actually run tests on humans, but instead used animals that are very close to us in terms of biology and brain function: rhesus macaques &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These monkeys were asked to identify shapes and colors on a screen, and to look in particular directions to give their answers. While this was happening, brain scans were used to check for overlapping patterns and shared areas of activity in the animals' brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/computers-made-from-human-brain-tissue-are-coming-are-we-prepared"&gt;Computers Made From Human Brain Tissue Are Coming. Are We Prepared?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those scans showed the monkey brains using different blocks of neurons – 'cognitive Legos', in the words of the researchers – across tasks. Existing blocks can be repurposed and recombined across new tasks, showing a neural flexibility that even the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-using-artificial-intelligence-ruin-your-actual-intelligence-scientists-investigated"&gt;best AI models&lt;/a&gt; can't compete with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"State-of-the-art AI models can reach human, or even super-human, performance on individual tasks," &lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/news/2025/cognitive-legos"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tim Buschman, from Princeton University. "But they struggle to learn and perform many different tasks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the brain is flexible because it can reuse components of cognition in many different tasks. By snapping together these 'cognitive Legos', the brain is able to build new tasks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the video below, the animals had to discriminate between shapes and colors in three separate but related tasks that required the animals to continually learn and apply what they knew from one task to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive Lego blocks the researchers identified were concentrated in the brain's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;. The region is linked to higher cognition – solving problems, planning, making decisions – and seems to play an important role in cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that when certain cognitive blocks weren't needed, activity in them was reduced, suggesting the brain can file away the neural Legos that it doesn't immediately need to better focus on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think about a cognitive block like a function in a computer program," &lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/news/2025/cognitive-legos"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Buschman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One set of neurons might discriminate color, and its output can be mapped onto another function that drives an action. That organization allows the brain to perform a task by sequentially performing each component of that task."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It explains how monkeys and possibly humans can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-has-a-hidden-rhythm-and-it-may-reveal-how-smart-you-are"&gt;adapt to challenges&lt;/a&gt; and tasks they haven't seen before, and use &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-critical-boom-in-technology-traced-back-more-than-half-a-million-years"&gt;existing knowledge&lt;/a&gt; to tackle them – something that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="185062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in its current form struggles with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, the researchers suggest their findings could help train AIs to be more adaptable to new tasks. Their work could also be useful in developing treatments for neurological and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-reveals"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; where people struggle to apply skills to new settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, these cognitive Legos show, on a fundamental level, how our brains are more flexible and adaptable than AI models, which exhibit so-called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611835114"&gt;catastrophic forgetting&lt;/a&gt;: a weakness that means neural networks can't learn consecutive tasks without forgetting how to perform the last one they trained on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-multitasking-gets-trickier-and-even-dangerous-as-we-age"&gt;task-switching&lt;/a&gt; isn't exactly great &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-multitasking-drains-your-energy-reserves-and-what-you-can-do-about-it"&gt;for our brains,&lt;/a&gt; applying what we know from one task to another can be a useful shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If, as suggested by our results, the brain can reuse representations and computations across tasks, then this could allow one to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, either by learning the appropriate task representation through reward feedback or by recalling it from long-term memory," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09805-2"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09805-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/24/1266983858/weather-climate-mosquito-repellent-worse#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NPR;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, the warmer, wetter weather is helping mosquitoes thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;East Middlesex Mosquito Control Project entomologist Doug Bidlack said that the warmer weather is causing a shift in mosquito populations. Other entomologists noted that higher temperatures could alter their behaviors, their habitat, and "even change how pathogens incubate and spread inside their bodies," per NPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The changing weather is linked to rising temperatures caused by planet-warming gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Locals in Massachusetts are noticing the shift in behavior. Abigail Krich-Starr, who lives in eastern Massachusetts, told NPR, "Just being in our backyard each year, in recent years, has become harder and harder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She added, "Last year … we were just getting eaten alive out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is changing mosquito behavior concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mosquitoes aren't just pesky insects that annoy you and make you itch. They also carry diseases, such as "malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/learn/mosquito-borne-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Mosquito Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Mosquito Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's no surprise NPR reported that mosquitoes are the "deadliest animal on the planet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2024, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/mosquito-season-state-change-global-warming/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; analysis showed that the average number of mosquito days — days with an average humidity of at least 42 percent combined with temperatures between 50 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit — is lengthening by multiple days, weeks, or even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Wilmington, North Carolina, mosquito days have increased by 11 days since 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, mosquitoes are breeding and creating hybrid species. According to Utah State University researchers, southern house mosquitoes have migrated north and are breeding with northern house mosquitoes.
