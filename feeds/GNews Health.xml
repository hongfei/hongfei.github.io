The retired wrestling icon reportedly died following a cardiac arrest incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many high-profile stories of cardiac arrest in recent years. In July 2023, basketball player Bronny James &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lebron-james-bronny-cardiac-arrest_n_64bfdca6e4b0dcb4caba63bb" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="suffered a cardiac arrest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64bfdca6e4b0dcb4caba63bb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;suffered a cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; during a USC practice session. Earlier that year in January, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field during an NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals with the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest is a terrifying event no person ― or family ― ever wants to experience. The recent news stories of cardiac arrests among athletes have certainly put a spotlight on this type of medical emergency and the potentially lifesaving steps bystanders can take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Retired wrestler Hulk Hogan died on July 24. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiac arrest is when your heart stops completely and is no longer pumping blood to your vital organs, like the brain, liver and kidneys,” Dr. Comilla Sasson, the vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care at the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest can stem from a known heart condition or occur suddenly and unexpectedly. The most common cause is ventricular fibrillation ― a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. It’s an electrical disturbance that prevents the heart from doing its job properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been some speculation that what happened to Damar Hamlin was something called commotio cordis,” Sasson said. “Something hits you in the chest ― blunt chest trauma ― and does it at the exact time your heart is contracting. That sets your heart into an irregular rhythm, ventricular fibrillation, so your heart can no longer pump like it should, leading to cardiac arrest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commotio cordis was first described &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="in the context of 18th-century laborers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;in the context of 18th-century laborers&lt;/a&gt;, but more recently this sort of blunt trauma event has tended to occur in sports like baseball, hockey, lacrosse and football. Although several medical experts have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pointed to commotio cordis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;pointed to commotio cordis&lt;/a&gt; as a potential explanation for Hamlin’s cardiac arrest, they’ve also emphasized that the public is not privy to the personal medical information necessary to identify a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic conditions can make your heart have an irregular heart rhythm,” Sasson said. “&lt;span&gt;Athletes can also be prone to something called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,” she added, describing it as a thickening of heart muscle that is sometimes seen among elite athletes engaged in heavy training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone admitted to the hospital following cardiac arrest will undergo testing to determine a cause and treatment protocol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Attacks vs. Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people often use the terms “cardiac arrest” and “heart attack” interchangeably, they are different medical events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart attack, in the colloquial sense, is what we would refer to as an acute myocardial infarction,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist and the director of the cardiac intensive care unit at &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mount Sinai Morningside" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Mount Sinai Morningside&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of the heart muscle is severely jeopardized or dies, typically due to an insufficiency of oxygen supply compared to demand for oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, there’s an artery blockage that prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching part of the heart, and if it’s not reopened quickly, that section can die. So in a heart attack, the heart is still pumping, but the blood supply is cut off. With a cardiac arrest, the heart is not pumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Kirk Irwin via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kirk Irwin via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during the first quarter of a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in 2023.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A heart attack or myocardial infarction can be the inciting cause for a cardiac arrest, but the two are distinct,” Tomey said. “Most heart attacks do not cause cardiac arrest. However, a sizable percent of cardiac arrests result from some type of heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a cardiac arrest happens quickly, the symptoms of a heart attack more often build slowly (though they can be immediate as well).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many patients will have a heart attack and slowly feel the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Lawrence Phillips, a cardiologist at the &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="NYU Langone Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt; medical center. “They then come to the emergency room hopefully early, where professionals diagnose a heart attack and open up the blood vessel that has the blockage using catheters and stents. There can be damage to the heart muscle, but we can decrease that risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a cardiac arrest, it’s important to immediately start providing emergency care, as every minute makes a difference for the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone has a cardiac arrest, it’s really an acute cessation of the heart’s ability to provide blood, usually from an arrhythmia, so the heart is not able to pump,” Phillips said. “It’s often very abrupt. Someone will slump over or collapse. We try to use whatever means we have to bring them back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance Of CPR For Treating Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="estimates" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that more than 356,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the U.S. each year, and about 90% result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a range of outcomes for individuals who survive cardiac arrest,” Tomey said. “The best outcome is to return to your baseline level of function physically and neurologically. Some individuals will survive but have some degree of residual neurologic impairment, and the degree can range quite widely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your best chance at improving someone’s outcome after cardiac arrest is to act fast by administering CPR. In the case of Hamlin, the NFL confirmed that he received CPR on the field, and others present reported the use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once cardiac arrest starts, blood flow stops,” said Dr. John Bozinovski, a cardiac surgeon at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “Two organs that are quite sensitive to lack of blood supply are the brain and heart, with the brain being exquisitely sensitive to injury. If blood circulation is not restored, brain injury can start within minutes and become irreversible shortly thereafter. The longer the lack the blood flow, the greater and more extensive the injury to the brain and other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPR is a way to restore blood flow, using mechanical energy to move blood to the vital organs. By doing chest compressions, you essentially act as a person’s heart while theirs isn’t working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prompt administration of CPR can double or triple likelihood of survival by getting oxygen back to the body,” Phillips noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don’t have to be formally CPR-certified to perform the lifesaving procedure. The American Heart Association recommends using “hands-only CPR” in the event of a cardiac emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conventional CPR, which is typically used by trained health care providers, utilizes chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing, whereas hands-only CPR does not use mouth-to-mouth breathing and is meant to be utilized by the public at large,” said body performance and injury expert &lt;a href="https://ramihashish.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rami Hashish" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://ramihashish.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Rami Hashish&lt;/a&gt;. “Outside of the hospital, hands-only CPR has been found to be more effective in preserving life than conventional CPR. Reasons as to why this may be included poor quality of, and time loss during, mouth-to-mouth ventilation by the nonmedically trained public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health experts who spoke to HuffPost emphasized how easy hands-only CPR is to learn and pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="short videos that demonstrate" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;short videos that demonstrate&lt;/a&gt; how to do these chest compressions. While medical professionals might be well versed in combining chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth (along with other tools at their disposal), the general public tends to feel less comfortable with traditional CPR and thus less inclined to act swiftly in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve found that with hands-only CPR, people feel much more empowered to take action and do something,” Phillips noted. “Take those moments to learn. Almost 90% of cardiac arrests occur in the home or workplace, so take a few minutes to learn this skill because the person who might need it could be your family member or co-worker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Do In The Event Of Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are experiencing a cardiac arrest, try to get to a place where you are not alone, or signal to someone you are in distress before you are incapacitated,” Bozinovski said, noting that it sometimes happens too fast for you to dial 911, so asking someone nearby is best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect someone else is experiencing cardiac arrest, take prompt action. Check for signs of consciousness, a pulse or breathing. Ask another bystander to call 911 or make the call yourself if no one else is around. Then begin hands-only CPR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands at the center of the chest and push hard and fast until help arrives,” Sasson said. “Try to push at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute ― the tune of ‘Stayin’ Alive’ or ‘Hips Don’t Lie.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important step is checking for an available AED, which can reset the heart’s natural rhythm. AEDs are typically available at workplaces, schools and sporting venues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing CPR immediately until such time that the defibrillator can be brought to the person in distress is important at limiting the time of no blood supply to the brain and other organs,” Bozinovski said. “Have a third person bring the AED and follow the instructions. These devices are made to provide guidance [on] how to place the paddles, will read the rhythm and provide shock if indicated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested watching a video or taking a course to learn more about using an AED as well. Still, Sasson emphasized that these devices are designed to be used by those without prior experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are very fearful. ‘What if i do it wrong? What if I shock someone who shouldn’t be shocked?’” she said. “But it’s built to determine if the person needs a shock. You cannot hurt somebody with an AED.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the person’s pulse will be restored and medical professionals can transfer them to the hospital, as was the case with Hamlin. Although the public will likely have to wait for more updates on the NFL player’s condition, there are steps you can take to make your family and community safer and more prepared for cardiac emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

&lt;p&gt;Diving into a public pool this summer? You might be plunging into a petri dish. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While chlorine is the go-to germ killer, it doesn’t work instantly. Some nasty germs can survive in treated water for minutes or even days, turning a refreshing swim into a risky dip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the threat is growing. Outbreaks of waterborne illnesses tied to pools and other recreational venues are on the rise — especially those caused by a resilient parasite that’s waiting to crash your summer plans with a case of watery diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses are most prevalent during the summer months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tropical studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not-so-crystal-clear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sparkling blue water isn’t always as clean as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone jumps in, they bring more than just sunscreen and swimsuits, leaving behind germs, grime and bodily fluids that can make others sick.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the average swimmer introduces:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 million microbes in a single drop of spit&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;140 billion microbes from feces&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up to two cans’ worth of sweat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A full cup of urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of those substances mix with chlorine to form chloramines, a chemical byproduct that can irritate your eyes and lungs and give off that strong “pool smell” most people wrongly associate with cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts say a strong smell of chlorine indicates a high level of urine in pool water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Angkana – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​It is a common myth that a strong chlorine smell is a good sign of a clean pool,” Lisa Cuchara, an immunologist and infectious disease specialist, wrote in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poop-pee-perspiration-chlorine-how-germy-is-swimming-pool-really/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In fact, it may actually be a red flag that means the opposite — that the water is contaminated and should perhaps be avoided,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s really lurking in the water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most pool-related illnesses happen when swimmers swallow contaminated water or come into contact with it through their skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If its levels are properly maintained, chlorine can kill many germs, like E. coli, in under a minute. Some germs, however, are far more stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take hepatitis A. It can survive in a chlorinated pool for about 16 minutes. The virus usually gets in the water through fecal contamination, like if if someone uses the bathroom and doesn’t wash their hands before hopping back in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant for swimming pools. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Evgeniya Sheydt – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once infected, the virus can inflame the liver and disrupt its ability to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s giardia, a parasite that often enters pools when people have accidents in the water or don’t rinse off properly. It can take 45 minutes or longer to kill with chlorine, and just a small sip of contaminated water can trigger diarrhea, stomach pain, gas and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Super pooper parasite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst offender is cryptosporidium, a microscopic germ with a tough outer shell that enables it survive in chlorine-treated water for up to 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like giardia, cryptosporidium commonly spreads when someone with diarrhea contaminates the water and another swimmer swallows it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2017, crypto caused nearly 450 outbreaks across 40 states and Puerto Rico, sickening more than 7,400 people, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses can leave swimmers with gut-churning symptoms, including diarrea.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks jumped 13% each year, with most traced back to people swallowing water from treated pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Swallowing just a mouthful of water with crypto in it can make otherwise healthy kids and adults sick for weeks with watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting,” Michele Hlavsa, chief of CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, said in &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2018/p0517-swimming-related-diseases.html"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bacteria, viruses and fungi, oh my! &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other troublemakers — including Shigella, norovirus and adenovirus — can also lurk in chlorinated water and wreck your gut. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria like Legionella and Pseudomonas pose additional risks. Legionella can cause a serious form of pneumonia, while Pseudomonas is known for triggering skin rashes and ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even fungi get in on the act. Pool decks, ladders, and locker rooms are breeding grounds for fungal spores. Once established, they’re hard to eliminate and often resistant to regular cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s how infections like athlete’s foot — and other skin irritations — spread so easily in damp, high-traffic areas like your local community pool. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Swimmer’s ear is a bacterial infection caused by water that stays in the outer ear canal for a long period of time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But don’t toss your trunks just yet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are simple steps you can take to reduce the spread of viruses, bacteria and other germs in swimming pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CDC recommends staying out of the water if you have diarrhea and waiting at least two weeks after symptoms clear up to take a dip. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Before you dive in, shower for at least a minute to rinse off dirt, sweat and any lingering germs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Parents should take kids on regular bathroom breaks and check diapers every hour — and never change them poolside.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While in the pool, try not to swallow water. When you’re out, dry your ears well with a towel to help prevent swimmer’s ear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And, of course, don’t pee or poop in the pool.  Sounds obvious? Not for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Last year alone, New York City’s parks department had to shut down pools 203 times to clean up after someone defecated, according to data obtained by The Gothamist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s 44 out of 52 public pools closed at least once for a “code brown.” On one day in August, 12 pools were shuttered because of poop in the water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pee’s no better. In a &lt;a href="https://www.healthypools.org/press-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;national survey&lt;/a&gt; released last month, more than half of participants admitted to urinating in the pool as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

A new study in human cells and mice has found the first experimental evidence that the compound can increase longevity and fight signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a psychedelic, psilocybin is usually investigated for its potential as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-finally-figured-out-how-magic-mushrooms-might-relieve-depression"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psilocybin-put-rat-brains-back-together-after-mild-head-trauma"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. But there hasn't been a whole lot of direct research into what effects it might have on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/older-people-who-use-psychedelics-show-fascinating-brain-functions"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, scientists at Emory University and Baylor College of Medicine in the US tested it on cultures of human cells and on live mice. Both cases showed drastic extensions of lifespan – treated cells lived more than 50 percent longer than untreated ones, while treated mice were much more likely to survive the whole period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelic-drugs-have-huge-therapeutic-potential-an-expert-explains-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Psychedelic Drugs Have Huge Therapeutic Potential.

The cells were then monitored until they reached &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;, a state where they essentially 'run out' of cell divisions and go dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At concentrations of 100 micromoles, treated lung cells took 57 percent longer to reach senescence, compared to untreated ones. Treated skin cells showed a 51 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168870" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168870" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-642x389.png" alt="First Experimental Evidence Suggests Psilocybin Extends Lifespan in Human Cells And Mice" class="wp-image-168870 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-642x389.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-685x415.png 685w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-768x465.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-600x363.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm.png 958w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168870" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Percentage of surviving mice over the 10-month study period.

And deaths from alcohol-related hepatitis, a disease resulting in severe liver inflammation, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39739407/" target="_blank"&gt;nearly tripled among women&lt;/a&gt; over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6dcc85" class="body-graf"&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154235652500610X" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, similarly points to an elevated risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol-related liver disease&lt;/a&gt; among women. The condition encompasses various types of liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption. It spans early-stage inflammation to severe scarring, known as cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-825a7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related liver disease for several reasons. For one, their bodies tend to have less water weight and a higher percentage of body fat. That combination increases the concentration of alcohol in their blood, which the liver then has to process. Compared with men, women also naturally have lower levels of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, which helps the body metabolize alcohol. That again leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22a7a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Those physiological differences, combined with the sharp increase in alcohol use and binge drinking, have made women particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7982b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Historically, there’s been differences in prevalence rates [of alcohol use] between men and women. And essentially, that gap has now closed and the ratio between men and women’s drinking is almost at 1 to 1,” said Sherry McKee, director of the Yale SCORE Program on Sex Differences in Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91615b" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes in women’s lifestyles have created increasing opportunities to consume alcohol, McKee said. Today’s young adults drink less compared with previous generations, but there are now more women in college than men — and college is generally associated with increased alcohol consumption, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72cef" class="body-graf"&gt;“You pair that with the fact that women are delaying childbirth, delaying marriage — it just gives more space for women to continue drinking in the post-college years,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2b205" class="body-graf"&gt;Women’s heavy alcohol consumption is most common in midlife, said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Some researchers attribute the trend to stress or office drinking culture, but Keyes said the main reason women are drinking more is for fun. She noted that wine and spirits are often marketed to women as luxury goods or methods of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said more awareness of the health risks of drinking could help encourage women to scale back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52632d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It isn’t the case that every single person who drinks heavily will get liver disease from it. But we do know that a proportion of those folks do — about 25 to 30%,” said Dr. Jessica Mellinger, a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health, a Michigan-based health system. The more a person drinks, she added, the greater likelihood they have of getting alcohol-related liver disease of any stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15cc54" class="body-graf"&gt;The study published Wednesday found that heavy drinkers are developing alcohol-related liver disease at more than double the rate compared with 20 years ago. The researchers suspect that’s because people vulnerable to liver disease — including women and those with obesity or diabetes — are drinking more compared with decades past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04089e" class="body-graf"&gt;“The modern American drinker looks different than it did 20 years ago,” said Dr. Brian Lee, the study’s lead author and a hepatologist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035b3b" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from a national, government-led survey to measure drinking habits and liver health in the U.S. They characterized heavy drinkers as men who consumed at least 30 grams of alcohol per day — roughly two standard drinks — and women who consumed at least 20 grams per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dfaba" class="body-graf"&gt;Among heavy drinkers, the risk of significant liver damage more than doubled over a 22-year period, from nearly 2% in 1999-2004 to more than 4% in 2013-20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382a41" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate of metabolic syndrome — conditions like obesity or high blood pressure that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke — among heavy drinkers also increased during that time, from 26% to nearly 38%. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes can cause fat to build up in the liver, thereby elevating the risk of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbdc5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It could be the situation of a perfect storm. We have an increase in alcohol consumption … alongside changing prevalence of these other [health] conditions,” Keyes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41e2d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Lee said it’s important for people to be honest with their doctors about their alcohol intake, so that doctors can decide whether to screen them for liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a11dde" class="body-graf"&gt;“Your risk of liver disease might be higher than you think,” he said. “The reality is that liver disease is silent, and most people — even with cirrhosis, which is end-stage liver disease — have no symptoms at all. I always say it’s a blessing and a curse that you need very little healthy amounts of liver to feel perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a911a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Keyes said women in particular tend to wait longer to seek medical care for heavy drinking due to social stigma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a23e77" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s really becoming this hidden epidemic where women wait too long to see someone about a really serious, alcohol-related condition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOT2ZCV3ZidlE0bWlyOGtWc2JRa3dsckp2UzhuTEFfNDNJc1NTenVFb0FucmpTX2xVNHZtS0JzUEhhZzNZR0Z1Q0FzSkFJcEFkSVZrdTZiX04za1FNM1VuNXBQanpfa2syVW5VWWoxcWRiQlRLNDJ5NDdoTHVKRndBTk9sdDd4bk5faWZXWF9OcXRDREJzX2ttVW5TMUR6Q3lSaDVxZdIBVkFVX3lxTE5CZzhwU04zVVJlX1lMSDA3bEJDMThrbVlrRUtta196QzNqZWRQRzkzazJ6eFdwb2VqMW9DcGRHOXYtMlNxd3pVQmNnNnRiYjl6OC1xMHBB</guid></item><item><title>肿胀的脚踝和血块：不健康的静脉会如何杀死你- The Telegraph | Swollen ankles and blood clots: How unhealthy veins could kill you - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPOGttTEQ1R2h1Rm9mcmN3YW52aHkwQVpJZUFFSlJHMkVpX21SMVI2YWlKbHhRMUlkTTJXd2FOTkhsbFAxZUZhcHd6LW9DZndNNDRmYmVFdGxSTjVnYlpoVUJPa2U4ZjN2WXFOUmJnVTVDLXdMRmo5Q3V3WW1vdnlpTmZFSXY1cWhnUUJWMGdsOGRVV2M0LXFFa0dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Chronic venous insufficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, CVI is a condition where the veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, “resulting in reverse flow which causes inflammation, typically around the ankles,” Whiteley explains. “The trouble is that CVI is a catch-all term which basically means that the valves aren’t working. This could be in the superficial veins near the skin surface or in the deep veins which run through your muscles.” Varicose veins may be a symptom of CVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, prolonged inactivity and family history. CVI may also occur in people who have previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT – see more on this condition below) and key symptoms include swollen, discoloured, achy, tired or tingly legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have swollen ankles and you think you could have CVI, it’s really important to get a scan because the treatments and outcomes are phenomenally different depending on whether you have CVI in the deep or superficial veins,” Whiteley explains. “It becomes a very different problem if the deep veins are involved, but fortunately – unless you’ve had DVT in the past – it’s usually superficial and can almost always be properly treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood clots form in your veins, the condition is called “thrombosis”. There are three key reasons why this happens, known as Virchow’s triad, Whiteley explains, and these are “changes in the blood, changes in the blood flow, and changes in the blood wall”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors that “change your blood” include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/30/every-cigarette-smoked-20-minutes-life-ucl-study-tobacco-uk/"&gt;smoking cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and taking the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/contraceptive-pill-myths/"&gt;contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt;, Whiteley says. The nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, whilst also damaging the inner lining of veins and causing inflammation. Meanwhile, in the pill, oestrogen is known to make blood more “sticky”, therefore increasing the risk of clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to the vessel wall can occur because of “inflammation, tumours, radiation, injury, or surgery”, whilst abnormal blood flow may occur when “you sit down or don’t move for long periods of time,” Whiteley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a blood clot forms below the knee or in a superficial vein (superficial thrombophlebitis), it’s not generally considered as dangerous and it may resolve itself, Whiteley says. However, it becomes more concerning if the clot forms in a vein behind the knee or, worse, between your knee and groin or pelvis. This is called a DVT…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Which is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein. “If a clot forms between your knee and groin, or in your pelvis, there’s a chance it travels to the heart, is pumped to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism [PE],” Whiteley explains. A PE can lead to serious complications including respiratory distress and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/dont-let-dvt-destroy-your-holiday/"&gt;Symptoms of DVT&lt;/a&gt; include throbbing pain or swelling in one leg, swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them and warm skin around the painful area. You’re more likely to get DVT if you’re over 60, have varicose veins, are overweight or have had the condition before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, DVT can also damage the deep veins. You can end up with a long-term swollen, discoloured leg, often with ulcers, which is called post-thrombotic syndrome,” Whiteley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should ask for an urgent GP appointment if you think you have DVT, or call 999 if you have symptoms such as swelling and breathlessness or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Venous leg ulcer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are open and painful sores which usually develop on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. You may develop a venous leg ulcer if you’ve previously had DVT, have varicose veins, are older, overweight or have difficulty walking and symptoms include pain, itching and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DVT can cause leg ulcers in the long term because the blood clots can damage valves in the veins, leading to inflammation which damages the skin,” Whiteley explains, whilst varicose veins also increase inflammation in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are unlikely to get better on their own and usually require specialist medical treatment to ensure they don’t become infected or lead to tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

Called the coagulation cascade, this involves up to 20 different proteins known as clotting factors, according to the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. National Library of Medicine" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. But when you don’t have one or more of these clotting factors, you have a higher chance of excess bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are the result of the lack of certain clotting factors. And some of the symptoms of these conditions may seem a bit odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia A is caused by the lack of blood clotting factor VIII, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hemophilia B" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia B&lt;/a&gt; happens when the body doesn’t make enough of coagulation factor IX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While both conditions are slightly different, the symptoms are generally the same. (However, they may vary based on how severe your condition is.) Most people with hemophilia are diagnosed at a young age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). But it’s possible to have a mild case of hemophilia A or B that goes undiagnosed until later in life, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Allyson Pishko, M.D." data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Allyson Pishko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a hematologist with the Penn Blood Disorders Center at Penn Medicine; &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="4.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia isn’t a condition that’s well-known to the general population and the exact number of people living with hemophilia isn’t known, per the CDC. What is known is the condition is much more common in genetic males than females, and that hemophilia A is three to four times as common as hemophilia B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both types can cause long-term complications like joint issues, and severe cases may be life-threatening, especially if they go untreated.

There is some variation here, though, and that can influence when someone is diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If severe, hemophilia is often diagnosed during infancy,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing. “Otherwise, it’s diagnosed later in life if a patient has excessive bleeding after injury or surgery.” Dr. Pishko also points out that someone with hemophilia may have “excessive bleeding” after their wisdom tooth is removed or they have a tonsillectomy. “Excessive bleeding is more than would be expected with a typical cut or injury, and [is] unable to be stopped using typical first aid,” Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Easy bruising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People with hemophilia may develop larger bruises after having injuries that are relatively minor, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. This is a sign of bleeding under the skin. “There are not enough clotting factors in the blood” to help slow down the bleeding that can lead to these large, noticeable bruises, Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Heavy periods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While hemophilia is much more common in men than women, females can inherit the condition, Dr. Pishko says. “This diagnosis is sometimes missed in females as they have been told that hemophilia only affects males,” she says. But Dr. Pishko says that women with hemophilia may end up dealing with heavy periods or heavy bleeding with childbirth. “It is important for females to have testing of their blood clotting levels if they have a family history of hemophilia or symptoms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Bleeding after vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s not common for anyone to experience bleeding from the injection site after getting a vaccine, but there is a slightly increased risk of bleeding after getting a shot in people who have hemophilia. People with hemophilia also have higher odds of developing a hematoma, or closed wound where blood collects, after being vaccinated, too, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="e25e45e1-8273-4e95-8a22-c262054636c9" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="15.1" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="430b2b2a-37b0-44df-9d0b-63efe3bb057f" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Joint pain and swelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia can cause bleeding in the joints, too, Dr. Pishko says. “This presents as sudden pain and swelling in the joint,” she says. “It can occur repeatedly within the same joint.” If left untreated, frequent bleeding in the joints can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="raise the risk of arthritis" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;raise the risk of arthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Lower range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because hemophilia can impact the joints, it can also limit your range of motion. This is more common in females with hemophilia compared to those who don’t have a bleeding disorder, according to the CDC.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Nosebleeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Everyone experiences nosebleeds at some point, but nosebleeds with no known cause can be a sign of hemophilia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Chronic-Nosebleeds-What-To-Do.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Chronic-Nosebleeds-What-To-Do.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Academy of Pediatrics" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP). This can happen when a blood vessel in the nose breaks and doesn’t clot easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Blood in the urine or stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Blood in the urine or stool can be a sign of internal bleeding. In the case of hemophilia, it can be spontaneous—meaning, it comes on suddenly. If you happen to notice blood in your urine or stool, it’s important to get it checked out right away, whether you suspect that you have hemophilia or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:31:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQdGkzTW1qUFR4MjdyNEE2Mm9iekh0czBmUFBPOXFKWDgtaGNQOWtORGlSWWVmRWZZSFZ0aHZxWXVPX2xRbU5mZVBHYTlXSFZyT3U3eXI0LTNTVkxDUDI0RnhzZGJHNnVfY050Q3RFbGFLTFNrNHpiVElYMlNCdERPa1J0b3FtTmMtU3RzaWtYcw</guid></item><item><title>这1种类型的癌症在所有女性中都在增加， 1组尤其面临风险- HuffPost | This 1 Type Of Cancer Is Increasing In All Women, And 1 Group Is Particularly At Risk - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMUVhVWZSRE1uYWtpV2gwSXg1TEk2N055THpjd0FDQ3RhSjQ5WDhfWlpJWW9BdWFsZVNJMkkyRTlPTjBOQnZpQ2Z1U2taLUttRHBqWXU0NTlnNHl1YkNQZUJ2OUplYmhfVzRSc2lfbFJia0Z2VlB5c0lKUW1FRVFOQXRUMmVmT0FmVk0tNy1kQlNVM3dqdENHSWtYWm02RFRJSE45NVRuV29hdEXSAbABQVVfeXFMUG5VOGt6U0NEcnFySy0zYS1QeVd2NlA1WFh4Q1ZiZWxrRGNlMmttRlpXdTN5LVh5R3I5djQ3bnRSeXFNQmVlVEZ6LVk5UjlIRWFhQ0o2S3RXV0ZiaFNLdFY5bTk3M04tWS1yUkpMbWlRYUVMTnBtSWxyRndGQlhaWndiQVQ5Y2o0WlgtTmFzMk1xT1c5eUVKZF9CbzJ3bWlWei13aFpPdUhuWG9hR19Pc18?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think of the most common gynecological cancer, you probably don’t think of uterine cancer, but this cancer type is more commonly diagnosed than other gynecological cancers such as ovarian and cervical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were nearly 70,000 cases of uterine cancer in 2024, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Cancer Institute" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer involves cancer of what many folks think of as the womb, “or the place where a pregnancy is housed and grows,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ami Vaidya" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Ami Vaidya&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecological cancer doctor at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The uterus has two components;

This makes it the most common GYN cancer in the country, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 12,000 people die of ovarian cancer each year while more than 13,000 die of endometrial cancer, said Hoskins. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t currently a screening test, but there are symptoms you should look out for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests like mammograms screen for breast cancer and pap smears screen for cervical cancer, there isn’t an equivalent for uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a test to predict early disease or pre-invasive disease,” said Hoskins. This makes it crucial to understand the warning signs of this kind of cancer and who it commonly occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s typically detected in post-menopausal women, so women after the age of menopause, after they’ve not had a cycle for greater than one year,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer is most common in this population, which tends to be women over the age of 50. In women who have gone through menopause, the sign of uterine cancer is often post-menopausal bleeding, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they suddenly start bleeding, they should call their gynecologist or their health care provider and say, ‘This is what’s going on,’ and that doctor, then, in turn, should see and examine the patient,” added Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelvic pain or discomfort is also a red flag, Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor may order testing to look at the uterus, such as an ultrasound, and will likely also do a biopsy on tissue from the uterus, said Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are the ways that, if someone’s having symptoms, that we can try to test and look for it,” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer isn’t as common in pre-menopausal women, but it can still happen, said Hoskins. Symptoms in this group include irregular heavy bleeding or bleeding between periods, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that any period irregularity or heavy bleeding is cancer, though, so, don’t panic, said Vaidya. There can be many common reasons for heavier or irregular periods such as fibroids or a polyp, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it does make sense for women to think about their body, to notice if there’s a change, and especially when we think of pre-menopausal women ... it is good, if you’re familiar with your normal [cycle] to then be able to report an abnormal [cycle],” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Black women are two times as likely to die from uterine cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain people are at higher risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few groups of people are at higher risk for developing uterine cancer, and while this includes Black women (more on that below), it also includes other folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can genetically be at higher risk of uterine cancer, too, said Hoskins. “Folks may have something called Lynch syndrome ... basically they’re born with the gene that puts them at risk,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, if you have a family history of colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, you should let your doctor know, both experts told HuffPost.

It is a weak estrogen, and fat cells don’t produce the balancing hormone progesterone at all. So for patients who are obese, who are over their ideal body weight, those patients will have estrone in their body that stimulates the lining of the uterus, and because they don’t have the balanced progesterone from those same fat cells over time, those are women that are at increased risk for developing this endometrial pre-cancer and endometrial cancers,” explained Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that obesity itself isn’t an indicator of one’s health, but there are cases, like this one, when it can impact chances of developing certain diseases. And in this case, Vaidya added that the more overweight someone is, the higher their risk is for uterine cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

If left uncorrected, poor posture can lead to wear and tear on the spine that’s harder to reverse down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tummy time can impact hip and back pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adult tummy time also helps to open up the front of the hips and activate the core and back muscles, which are key players in everyday back pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people spend far too much time sitting, whether at a desk, in a car, or on the couch. The human body was not designed for such inactivity,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a spinal and orthopedic surgeon at the Institute for Comprehensive Spine Care in New York and New Jersey. He fears if we don’t change these habits we will soon see “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an increase in musculoskeletal issues across all age groups.” These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Degenerative disc disease, where the discs between the vertebrae begin to wear down due to constant pressure and a lack of movement. “This can lead to stiffness, pain, and even nerve compression.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sciatica, occurring when the sciatic nerve is irritated or compressed, often by a herniated disc or tight muscles in the lower back. “People may experience sharp pain that radiates down the leg, along with numbness or weakness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tight hip flexors, leading to pelvic misalignment and lower back pain. “Over time, this can impact your gait and make everyday movements more difficult.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flipping onto your stomach can counteract extended sitting just as it does for infants, he said. “When you lie on your stomach, you naturally extend the spine, which helps reverse the flexed posture that sitting creates. This gentle spinal extension relieves pressure on the discs, especially in the lower back, and allows the back muscles to stretch and activate differently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, you are able to open the hip flexors, which are often tightened and shortened from sitting too much. “By relaxing into a prone position, the hips and pelvis can realign more naturally, which supports better posture when you return to standing or sitting,” Okubadejo said. So, your tummy time actually makes you better at sitting too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s what tummy time looks like for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adult tummy time position isn’t natural for most of us, so I recommend starting slow, and breaking adult tummy time into increments,” Jazini said. “Take three to five minutes at a time, a few times a day, lying on your stomach while propped on your elbows. You should feel a stretch in the front of the neck, as well as in your back and in your hips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Katie Breaker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Katie Breaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a sales director in Denver, said she’d tried various seat cushions and stretches without much improvement in back pain. Then, her physical therapist suggested tummy time — simply lying face down for 10 minutes per day. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No devices or setup. Just a flat surface, arms by the side, and a quiet room. After about a week of doing this twice a day, I added a thin towel under my chest and held it for fifteen minutes,” she said. Two weeks later, she could feel her back decompressing and had less hip tension and more flexibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I could walk longer during event setups without fatigue,” she said. So, she kept upping her time and now does two 20-minute sessions per day, especially during long workdays on a computer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

                A new study shows people in countries with different obesity rates burn about the same number of calories.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back in the 1800s, obesity was almost non-existent in the United States. Over the last century, it's become common here and in other industrialized nations, though it remains rare among people who live more traditional lifestyles, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/24/545631521/is-the-secret-to-a-healthier-microbiome-hidden-in-the-hadza-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Hadza hunter-gatherers &lt;/a&gt;of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's changed? One common explanation is that, as societies have developed, they've also become more sedentary, and people have gotten less active. The assumption is that as a result, we burn fewer calories each day, contributing to an energy imbalance that leads to weight gain over time, &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/pontzer-herman" target="_blank"&gt;says Herman Pontzer,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of evolutionary biology and global health at Duke University who studies how human metabolism has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS,&lt;/em&gt; Pontzer and an international team of collaborators found that's not the case. They compared the daily total calorie burn for people from 34 different countries and cultures around the world. The people involved ran the spectrum from hunter-gatherers and farming populations with low obesity rates, to people in more sedentary jobs in places like Europe and the U.S., where obesity is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Surprisingly, what we find is that actually, the total calories burned per day is really similar across these populations, even though the lifestyle and the activity levels are really different," says Pontzer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And that finding offers strong evidence that diet — not a lack of physical activity — is the major driver of weight gain and obesity in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This does sort of really fly in the face of what a lot of us anecdotally assumed was driving a lot of the weight gain and obesity today," says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/deirdre-kay-tobias/" target="_blank"&gt;Deirdre Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, an obesity and nutritional epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Tobias was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different activity levels, same calorie burn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers examined data for more than 4,200 adult men and women. Study participants were given a special water to drink that contained isotopes which came out in their urine. These isotopes allow scientists to determine exactly how much energy a person expends – not just in active movement but also the energy it takes to keep our hearts beating, our nervous systems functioning and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/22/1189303227/neat-fitness-non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis" target="_blank"&gt; just generally stay alive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This allows us to get a really accurate measure of how many calories people burn per day over the course of about a week," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When they adjusted for body size, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people from populations with higher obesity rates burned only slightly less total energy per day than those from populations that weighed less. These differences in energy expenditure didn't contribute much to the differences in obesity rates among populations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may seem implausible that someone who is out foraging for berries all day burns about the same amount of daily calories as, say, your typical office worker, Pontzer says it fits with what scientists have been learning about how our bodies burn calories. Pontzer's past research has suggested that our bodies tend to adjust how we expend energy to keep our total calorie burn stable within a pretty narrow range.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So if we burn more of our energy every day on physical activity, on exercise, after a while our bodies will adjust and spend less energy on the other tasks that we sort of don't notice going on in the background," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing the message on obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new findings have big implications for obesity. If differences in calorie burn can't explain why some countries have higher obesity rates than others, then it must be something else. "And that would be diet," says Tobias, who praised the design of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's 100% the diet," agrees &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/dariush-mozaffarian" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. "And I think then the question is, what is it about the diet?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian was not involved in the study, but he says it adds to other recent research that suggests food is the biggest driver in obesity. He points out there's been a major shift in our food supply in recent decades — which is now dominated by&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt; ultra-processed food.&lt;/a&gt; In a subanalysis of the data for some of the populations, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people in countries that got more of their calories from ultra-processed foods tended to have more obesity and higher body fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For decades we've been telling Americans that you're lazy, it's your fault, you're not moving enough, you're eating too much," Mozaffarian says. "And I think what this study shows is that there's really complicated biology happening and that our food is driving this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean there's no &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5323814/exercise-colon-cancer-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;reason to exercise.&lt;/a&gt; After all, it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;good for our mental &lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt; physical health &lt;/a&gt;in so many ways that have nothing to do with weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt; But it does mean we can't outrun a bad diet. Pontzer says if we want to tackle obesity, the public health message should focus on changing what's on our plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The last thing Chevese Turner needed was medication to help her lose weight. Twenty years into recovery from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/binge-eating-disorder" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;binge eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/eating-disorder-treatment" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;atypical anorexia&lt;/a&gt;, she was done trying to whittle her physique into something it didn't want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after developing diabetes a few years ago, her doctor prescribed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-weight-loss-meds-injections-compare-costs-results-side-effects" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (or GLP-1) that helps &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/what-is-diabetes" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;curb diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. A side effect of the medication? Weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, Turner, who lives outside Washington, DC, hesitated. "I don't want to start getting into this mode where I'm like, 'Yay, I'm losing weight,'" said Turner, 57, the CEO of the Body Equity Alliance, an advocacy and coaching organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of her recovery from BED included learning to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/intuitive-eating" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eat intuitively&lt;/a&gt; and letting her body tell her when it was hungry. Cautiously, she starting taking the drug. But, even at a low dose, Mounjaro eliminated her desire to eat, which caused her to drop pounds. This worried her.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    Turner said her doctor told her not to worry about losing her appetite. That worried her.

          &lt;p&gt;"I still have a therapist and I do everything I can to make sure that I keep in strong recovery," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, who had prescribed the medication, didn't understand her concerns. "She said, 'You don't have to eat lunch.' And I was like, 'No, I need to eat lunch and dinner and breakfast and snacks.' She just doesn't get eating disorders at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d" data-toc-id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic is hitting eating disorder centers hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;one in eight&lt;/a&gt; adults is currently taking a GLP-1, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, designed for diabetes, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-ozempic-wegovy-novo-nordisk-weight-loss-drugs-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-wegovy-ozempic-no-evidence-stop-taking-works-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;, marketed for weight loss.

While originally intended for people with type 2 diabetes or chronic obesity, these drugs have been co-opted by those seeking weight loss — even if it's not medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that these medications can trigger new eating disorders, worsen existing ones, and complicate recovery. Brittany Lacour,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of clinical assessment intake at Eating Recovery Centers, with programs across the country, said the number of people who have come into ERC already on a GLP-1 went from 11 in 2023 to 31 in 2024. So far there have been 14 cases in 2025, including a 14-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West, says more and more people with GLP-1 prescriptions are being admitted with eating disorders.

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"We are seeing people who are coming into treatment with a relapse or new onset, and most of them are presenting with restrictive eating patterns, like anorexia," said Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West. She is also seeing an increase in atypical anorexia, a form of anorexia nervosa where someone is significantly restricting calories but is of average or above average weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joel Jahraus, vice president of medical services at Monte Nido, a national eating disorder treatment provider, has seen a 25% to 33% increase in patients already on GLP-1 medications when they enter treatment. Most, if not all, of them have a binge-eating disorder. "A year ago there was no one presenting for an intake on a GLP-1 and then it increased to a couple a month going back 6 months," he said. These days, Monte Nido gets around three to five patients a month who are on a GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he notes, patients often hide their GLP-1 use from the person doing the intake, typically only bringing it up when they show up onsite for actual admission. Doctors attribute their reticence to shame, embarrassment, and the fear that their medications might be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of these meds can go absolutely contrary to the goals of eating disorder treatment, so it's important to figure that out," Jahraus said. "If they are low body weight and have no other indication for use such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, there is no place for the GLP-1 meds because the medication causes further weight loss. If they are normal or above normal body weight, we go through a process to gauge if they'll be successful at stopping their eating disorders, but that comes after treatment is initiated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178" data-toc-id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I feel that I need to'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, Rose, 32, who lives outside Boise, Idaho, wrestled with restrictive eating and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glennon-doyle-describes-identity-shift-from-anorexia-nervosa-diagnosis-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt;, cycling in and out of residential and non-residential treatment programs.

            &lt;/section&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So when she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago, she finally had a "legit" medical reason to ask her internist for a prescription for Ozempic. She was elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, dietician, and therapist were not. For people like Rose, with a history of restrictive eating, the inability to be in tune with their body could be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Rose managed to persuade her internist to give her a prescription. He nervously agreed, but with strict conditions: she had to eat at least 1,500 calories a day, not exercise compulsively, and not lose more than two pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as I was meeting those goals and all else was OK, I could stay on it," said Rose, who is currently on disability. (For privacy reasons, she requested anonymity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of starting the drugs, which she injected into her abdomen, she noticed a shift. She needed less insulin, and sometimes didn't any. But more importantly, she no longer spent hours ruminating on food and weight. And her hunger disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It actually freaked me out," she said. "I wasn't intentionally restricting, but I had to force myself to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daily caloric intake plummeted to about 850 calories and then 350, which she tracked with MyFitnessPal. She did an hour of cardio every day and regularly took laxatives and diuretics, all of which she hid from her team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, of course, she&lt;em&gt; liked&lt;/em&gt; the weight loss. She couldn't help herself. As she put it, "I know I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I still feel that I need to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Dr. Doreen Marshall"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Dr. Doreen Marshall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report in Annals of Internal Medicine, in 2022 and 2023 about 24,500 emergency room visits were linked to semaglutide, Ozempic's active ingredient, primarily due to severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ozempic-stomach-paralysis-woman-says-weight-loss-drug-made-life-hell-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of Ozempic and Mounjaro, for not disclosing the risk of serious gastrointestinal issues caused by the drugs. (The case is still pending.) As of May 1, there have been 1,809 lawsuits pending against the makers of GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who stops taking the medications regains about two-thirds or more of the weight they lost on it — a widely accepted statistic that can make it hard for someone with an eating disorder to quit the drugs. But there are no studies on the long-term impacts of these drugs on health.&lt;/p&gt;

"People are often surprised to learn that routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed," said Dr. Doreen Marshall, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Many general medical practitioners receive limited or no training or education on eating disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when it comes to patients in larger bodies, who might suffer from BED or atypical anorexia. Many doctors see a heavier patient and assume they simply need to lose weight, but that's not always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're prescribing for higher-weight people what we diagnose as eating disorders in thin people," said Deb Burgard, a psychologist and eating disorders specialist, and one of the founders of the Health at Every Size framework of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The breathless hype about a drug that aims to starve people is that it starves people seemingly without a protest from the starving body," Burgard added. "From our bodies' point of view, starvation is a disaster, no matter the source."&lt;/p&gt;

Her diabetes is under control, and that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she remains vigilant so she doesn't fall back into her old habits. She began setting a timer to remember when to eat, which she had done in the early stages of her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had worked so hard for a long time to become an intuitive eater and my whole self has changed because I'm in recovery and I eat intuitively," she said. "It's just a totally different relationship with food and body. So I had to start going back to the very beginning of what I did in my recovery, and that was set timers to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Rose, she has lost about 45 pounds since starting Ozempic. After her insurance stopped covering it, she began paying $1,000 a month out of pocket for a similar drug, Rybelsus, that a family member — believing she wanted it for her diabetes — helped her procure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it," she said. She has had regular appointments with her endocrinologist, but never discussed her GLP-1 use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid May, she ran out of Rybelsus and didn't refill it; it was too expensive. Around this same time she landed in the hospital with low potassium, which doctors blamed on her overuse of diuretics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she had her way, she'd go back on Ozempic to lose another 45 pounds. She's thinking about buying some online, which won't require a doctor's prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is dangerous in its own right, as unregulated or unlicensed vendors have been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-cheaper-ozempic-sold-online-contains-dangerous-ingredients-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;selling fake Ozempic online&lt;/a&gt; or in medical spas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the World Health Organization warned about falsified batches of Ozempic; the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy identified thousands of websites illegally selling fraudulent weight-loss drugs. Worldwide, 42 people were hospitalized after taking fake injections, according to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. Some people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose knows she's playing with fire. Still, she isn't ready to give up the drug. "I feel like I'm doing better than I have in a while, but the thoughts of wanting to lose weight or take Ozempic don't ever go away."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, what is interesting, says Kelly, is that: “All these disorders that we write about, the literature now is leaning towards them all having inflammation as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immune system is likely not working right in some people. And that leads to inflammatory markers and inflammation. My suggestion is that to some people, gluten is one of the culprits in this immune inflammatory reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms Kelly sees among her psychiatric patients are brain fog, anxiety or depressive symptoms. “They sometimes have headaches and migraines. Joint pain is common too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease and NCGS diagnoses are more common in individuals with ADHD symptoms than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between coeliac disease and depression is well-established. One large study of over 2,000 people with coeliac disease showed a 39 per cent lifetime prevalence of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One theory is that depression stems from the difficulty of living with a chronic illness,” says Kelly. “But there are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1894"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing a more direct physiological link between coeliac disease and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is even clearer clinical data that those with schizophrenia can be helped by following a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient of Kelly’s suffering from schizophrenia always saw her illness worsen after having gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was doing well in the community but when she had gluten she would be hospitalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When she got into the hospital they would give her gluten because they wouldn’t believe the family that that mattered. Each time the family would have to fight about it at every hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other proteins are also linked to inflammation of the brain. “Casein from milk is another protein that is highly immunogenic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of ultra-processed foods (UPFs)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the gluten realm there’s a movement towards understanding the impact of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s evidence to show that depression and anxiety and most &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-american-beige-diet-thats-making-us-all-sick/"&gt;mental health conditions are higher in people who eat high levels of UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the western diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And wheat is part of that. Wheat is now the most widely cultivated crop in the world, and it supplies 20 per cent of all food calories and protein consumed by the global population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data is showing us that there are more people sensitive to gluten than before, we think that’s due to a higher gluten content in UPFs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why gluten may now cause a more severe immune response is that there has been a six-fold increase in the gliadin content of wheat over time. This may be down to the use of high-nitrogen fertilisers and how wheat is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The antibodies show the way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman who came to Kelly suffering from anxiety and brain fog had previously been tested for gluten sensitivity by her gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was told she didn’t have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity. So I brought her in to take part in my study, and sure enough her antibody response was the biggest I’d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually found antibodies to suggest coeliac disease, which are called TTG. I gave her the paperwork and said, ‘please go back to your doctor’. When she went back, they did a biopsy and they found she had coeliac disease. It had been missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is one of almost a thousand people in the general population that Kelly has tested for gluten antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people have these antibodies, once I say, ‘You’re positive for this, it &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gluten-free-diet/"&gt;might be worth trying a gluten free diet&lt;/a&gt;’, most people report their joint pain went away, or their brain fog, or their anxiety and depression improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has published 24 peer reviewed studies around these antibodies and the relationship of gluten to neurological and psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thirty per cent of my patients with schizophrenia have antibodies to gliadin. That means their body is having an immune response to wheat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you change your diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work has changed her diet. Kelly now eats a low carb, almost gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/tried-20-fad-diets-how-lost-five-stone/"&gt;fad diet&lt;/a&gt; person,” she says. “If you’d told me I would be studying this I would have laughed. But science took me there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From looking at animal studies, the data would suggest that gluten could be bad for everyone. “We haven’t gone so far as to say that,” says Kelly, cautiously. “But when you start to dig into it, and you’ve seen what a brain looks like of an animal of gluten, it really makes me think twice about how much should be in my diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, not everybody should be on a gluten-free diet. About 10 per cent of the population have NCGS. And Kelly sees lots of people who have no immune response at all. “Their bodies handle it fine. But then there are lots of people who have the antibodies and coeliac in their families and that’s where removal could really help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s not going to be a cure all for everybody, typically Kelly sees changes in her patients in as little as three weeks. Brain imaging data has also shown how the blood flow in their brain improves on a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do recommend talking to your dietitian or doctor beforehand. That’s because many foods that contain gluten are fortified with minerals and vitamins that our body needs, but struggles to get from our diet. Things like folic acid. You need folate for your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also notes that for those who have a psychiatric disorder, such as depression or schizophrenia, eating a gluten-free diet can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you are sick, it’s easier to just continue to eat gluten because it’s cheap and you don’t have to spend time cooking. When you’re not feeling well you don’t want to spend time cooking fresh vegetables. It becomes a cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Food as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 years ago Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All this time later we are now starting to pay attention to the impact of the food we put in our body,” says Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents of one young man with a seizure disorder noticed that every time he had a big spaghetti meal his seizures were worse. “And no one thought that that was related,” says Kelly, who was consulted by a neurologist on the case. “While he didn’t test positive for coeliac disease, he did have antibodies to gliadin. And so we suggested a gluten free diet and he has been seizure free since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is challenging for people to understand that a gluten-free diet helps their brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is used to resistance to new ideas, that is the lot of the scientist. However she says: “We now have the technology. We can look at brain imaging and antibodies and show that it actually connects. We know for a fact that the brain is impacted by what we put into our gut and now we have to unravel all the mysteries there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Your Brain Off Grain: How a gluten-free diet could improve your mental and neurological health by Jessica A.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplements may seem like an easy way to support brain function, but they’re not always safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians advise against taking supplements like vitamins E and B6 when supporting brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, experts suggest adopting lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protecting and supporting your brain health is one of the smartest investments you can make for your overall well-being. Our brains are responsible for everything from memory and focus to emotional resilience and problem-solving. “Brain health means supporting the structure and function of your brain so it can perform at its best, both now and in the long run,” says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s about &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protecting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, memory, mood, focus and mental clarity. Just like we care for our heart or gut, taking care of the brain is key for daily performance and long-term health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lifestyle choices like proper nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management are vital, there’s often a temptation to reach for supplements that promise to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost brainpower&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all supplements are created equal, and some could do more harm than good. Below, we’ll explore five supplements to avoid for better brain health and provide alternative strategies to support your cognitive vitality effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin E is often touted as a brain booster due to its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;, which can protect cells from oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, expert opinions reveal that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-dose vitamin E supplements&lt;/a&gt; may cause more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High-dose vitamin E supplements are not recommended for better brain health,” explains &lt;a href="http://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “While vitamin E does have antioxidant properties, taking it in large amounts hasn’t been shown to improve memory or cognitive function in healthy individuals and may actually pose risks. Too much can interfere with blood clotting and may even increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of certain types of stroke&lt;/a&gt;,” Young adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of supplements, it’s safer to get vitamin E through food sources. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-11758822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet that includes nuts, seeds and leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; not only provides vitamin E but also ensures it’s absorbed in a way that complements your body’s natural processes without creating a risk of overdose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-high-dose-vitamin-b6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; High-Dose Vitamin B6 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B6 is crucial for brain function because it supports the production of neurotransmitters, which help regulate your mood and cognitive performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, like vitamin E, more isn’t always better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-6 fatty acids are essential fats that our bodies need, but an imbalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to inflammation, which can negatively impact brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many diets already contain more omega-6 than recommended, primarily from ultra-processed foods and vegetable oils. Taking omega-6 supplements may worsen this imbalance, especially if you aren’t balancing your intake with ample omega-3 fatty acids. This can potentially fuel brain-related inflammation. Instead, increase your intake of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts and flaxseed, which can help restore the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-when-you-wake-up-if-you-have-chronic-inflammation-8789044" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, thereby supporting brain health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond avoiding harmful supplements, there are several natural ways to boost brain health. Here are a few simple strategies:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-buy-every-week-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11749988" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulates blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt; and promotes the release of chemicals that support memory and learning. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults need seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation and emotional regulation, so don’t skimp on shut-eye. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a brain-friendly diet:&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on whole foods, including healthy fats, lean protein and plenty of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, is particularly beneficial for cognitive health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can impair memory and decision-making. Incorporate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stress-reducing practices&lt;/a&gt; like mindfulness meditation, journaling or spending time in nature into your daily routine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay socially connected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining strong relationships stimulates your brain and supports emotional well-being, whether it’s through group activities or simply spending time with loved ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

While supplements might seem like an easy way to “boost” brain function, not all of them are effective or safe. High doses of vitamins E and B6, as well as ginkgo biloba, caffeine supplements and omega-6, can be more harmful than helpful. Instead, focus on obtaining nutrients through a balanced diet and adopting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; like regular exercise, quality sleep and stress management. And if you plan to take supplements, be sure to get the green light from your health care provider first. 
&lt;/p&gt;

In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a brand of pedometer was launched called the manpo-kei, which translates as "10,000-step meter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this figure was "taken out of context" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Lancet study analysed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cardiovascular disease - down 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cancer - down 6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;dementia - down 38% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;and depression - down 22%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For most health conditions, the benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps although there were additional advantages to walking further for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person is holding a smartphone displaying a fitness tracking app while wearing white headphones and a smartwatch." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Counting daily steps has become a popular pastime with fitness trackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most exercise guidelines focus on time spent doing physical activity over step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/minimum-exercise-needed-week-according-to-new-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says. "When you move your muscles regularly, it helps improve &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/why-your-hands-and-feet-are-always-cold" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:circulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;circulation&lt;/a&gt; and prevents blood from pooling, which can ultimately help to lower your risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/departments/internal-medicine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/departments/internal-medicine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a board-certified cardiologist and chair of internal medicine at Burnett School of Medicine at TCU, adds that exercise is so important for muscles and the resulting flow helps prevent something called stasis (pooling of the blood), which is a major cause of blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/relaxing-habit-harming-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Cardiologist, and This ‘Relaxing’ Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Cardiologist, and This ‘Relaxing’ Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Causes Blood Clots?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of blood clots can vary based on the location, but for the sake of this article, we're going to focus on those in the arteries and veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a variety of reasons for clots to form in the peripheral circulation including some related to diseases that increase the tendency of blood to clot, and others because of an abnormality of the blood vessels themselves," says &lt;a href="https://limr.mainlinehealth.org/our-researchers/peter-kowey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Peter Kowey, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Peter Kowey, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist, professor of medicine and clinical pharmacology at Thomas Jefferson University and author of upcoming book &lt;em&gt;Failure to Treat&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other symptoms of blood clots, according to Dr. Belardo, include things like coughing up blood, a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-do-with-heart-palpitations-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:racing heartbeat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;racing heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, feeling lightheaded, trouble breathing, chest pain or tightness, or noticing swelling, warmth or a change in skin color, especially in your arms or legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sathyamoorthy adds that swelling on one side of the body, which comes out of nowhere (typically the lower legs—think calves) and is associated with pain/discomfort, particularly with flexion, is a sign you'll want to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get moving&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, staying active is one of the most important things you can do to prevent blood clots. This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-long-flight-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you. For example, for some people that may involve taking the stairs over the elevator or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-make-walks-more-effective" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:going on walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;going on walks&lt;/a&gt; with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Kowey, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/simple-hydration-trick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,&lt;/a&gt; is important to prevent increased blood viscosity that can increase the chances of a clot. You'll want to check with your doctor to see how much water you need to be drinking per day and make sure you're drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/i-am-cardiologist-this-is-what-i-add-to-almost-every-meal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understand your risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many health conditions, it's important to understand your risk factors.

It’s quick, easy and a great way to get a clearer picture of where you stand in terms of your overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests can be helpful, you'll want to talk to your doctor about your specific medical circumstances and history to get a better idea of how you can take the best care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;See a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, it's always best to consult with your doctor about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-does-a-blood-clot-feel-like" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and any other medical concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are simple, non-invasive tests to diagnose a deep venous or arterial clot and good medication to treat the problem safely," Dr. Kowey explains.

Nutrients such as sugar and fat trigger signals that travel from the digestive tract to nerve centers in a flash, guiding everything from cravings to satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the thought that the brain might also monitor the trillions of microbes living in the colon sounded almost science fiction – until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence shows that chemical chatter from resident bacteria can hit the nervous system in real time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drugs-targeting-gut-cells-not-brain-cells-are-better-at-treating-depression-and-anxiety/"&gt;shaping behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, such as how much we eat, within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings sketch out a neurobiotic “sixth sense” that sits alongside taste and smell, one that keeps tabs on microscopic neighbors before they cause trouble or waste precious calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-brain-monitors-the-gut"&gt;How the brain monitors the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most gut microbes cluster in the colon, where they break down leftovers and spin out vitamins that our bodies cannot make on their own. While they work, they shed fragments of protein that swirl through the intestinal stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common of these bits is flagellin, the building block of the spinning tails many bacteria use for propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/flagellin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Flagellin&lt;/a&gt; has long been known to trip immune alarms, but the speed of immune responses is measured in hours, not seconds. A faster line of communication had to exist if the brain were to react during a meal rather than after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have now traced such a line to neuropod cells – rare sensory cells embedded in the colon’s lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than one in a thousand epithelial cells qualifies as a neuropod, yet those spies plug directly into fibers of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-offers-new-hope-for-severe-depression/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;, the major information highway connecting gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-sensors-with-big-influence"&gt;Tiny sensors with big influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/publication/1450088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuropod cells&lt;/a&gt; in the small intestine are already famous for tasting nutrients. The new work shows that their cousins in the colon carry a receptor named Toll-like receptor 5 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR5&lt;/a&gt;), best known from immune cells that watch for bacterial flagellin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When flagellin docks on TLR5, the neuropod releases peptide YY (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/peptide-yy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PYY&lt;/a&gt;), a hormone that presses the brakes on appetite, and fires an electrical burst into the vagus nerve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In laboratory dishes, roughly one-quarter of isolated neuropods erupted with calcium sparks – an unmistakable sign of activation – within seconds of flagellin appearing. Block TLR5 and the flashes vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time,” said Bohórquez, a professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagellin-and-the-vagus-nerve"&gt;Flagellin and the vagus nerve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether this microscopic relay mattered in a living animal, the scientists threaded a hair-thin tube into the colons of mice and dripped in purified flagellin. Within moments, electrodes on the neck picked up a surge of activity in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-gut-brain-communication-affect-emotional-well-being/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice, which had fasted overnight, hesitated before taking their first bite and ate noticeably less during the next hour. The effect faded after about three hours – just long enough for the gut to clear its latest load of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same experiment was run on mice genetically engineered to lack TLR5 only in neuropod cells, the nerve stayed quiet and the animals &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-do-some-foods-seem-irresistible-the-answer-is-in-your-gut/"&gt;kept eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these mice gained weight even though their hormones, blood sugar, and gut inflammation stayed normal. Removing a single receptor from a tiny population of cells had quietly lifted a brake on food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dissecting-the-gut-brain-pathway"&gt;Dissecting the gut-brain pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steps in the circuit line up like dominoes: flagellin binds TLR5 on a neuropod cell, the cell releases PYY, PYY hits Y2 receptors on nearby vagus endings, and the electrical pulse races to appetite centers in the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfering at any point – blocking TLR5, preventing PYY release, or silencing Y2 receptors – cuts the signal. The speed of the response, measured in fractions of a second, sets it apart from hormonal cues such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humans-and-dogs-share-genes-linked-to-obesity/"&gt;leptin or ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;, which rise and fall over hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By responding swiftly, the gut can keep a running tally of microbial activity and adjust intake before the next mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” said Bohórquez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut. That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like obesity or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neuropods-flagellin-and-appetite"&gt;Neuropods, flagellin, and appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery slots gut bacteria alongside nutrients, stretch receptors, and hormones as direct contributors to appetite control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the neuropod pathway works locally in the colon and talks to the brain through existing nerves, it might one day be targeted without systemic side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs that mimic flagellin’s signal, or dietary tweaks that favor bacteria whose flagellins hit TLR5 hardest, could help curb overeating in a more natural-feeling way than current appetite suppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging hints suggest the circuit may also converse with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trusting-your-gut-instinct-can-make-you-happier/"&gt;emotional centers&lt;/a&gt;. The vagus nerve reaches brain regions involved in mood, and PYY has been linked to feelings of calm after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If microbial flagellin can influence those areas too, the microbiome might steer not only how much we eat but how we feel while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-we-learn-less-we-know"&gt;More we learn, less we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used flagellin from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/salmonella-typhimurium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a species better known for food poisoning than for friendly gut housekeeping. Harmless commensal bacteria sport subtly different flagellins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do those variations tweak the neuropod response, dialing appetite up or down depending on which microbes dominate? And does the brain treat all flagellins as the same “slow down” cue, or can it distinguish between benign tourists and rowdy invaders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions will require tools that can swap microbial strains on demand and sensors that report neuropod activity in real animals during normal meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tools come online, scientists expect to map a fuller picture of how bacterial voices blend with nutritional signals to fine-tune eating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, gut bacteria can tap a lightning-fast nerve circuit that tells the brain to put the fork down by flashing a protein badge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery places neuropod cells at the heart of a freshly recognized “neurobiotic sense,” one that keeps the peace between host and microbes meal after meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09301-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 01:26:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNWU5rd3RfSzRtYmxKay03enRVdXhtTGhJdzdRX0RuSGJ6WEFNWklSclJ2Zm4yeGtwam9xWkxORWxDZXRscUZFY1gydk5JU3BURlNQSmlHMkJaVHBNSkx5X2hrZmZoeGEzaXFLS0Q5aFo0bFpSTjhINWZlUWJadXlBVUJyMFRFUUZjMmNNWUZCTGpJOHV0Q3RyTktrNk9XN3pwQmxqRUQ2YV9Wc2dlZ0M3RG1aWFY3Yl9k</guid></item><item><title>牙医正在分享他们可以通过观察患者的口腔内部来告诉患者的所有信息，并且反应令人惊讶- BuzzFeed | Dentists Are Sharing All The Things They Can Tell About A Patient Just By Looking Inside Their Mouth And The Responses Are Surprising - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNSVVrMVV3Ry0tSjRkeWotWEVRTUl5RU9mMWdnYUlzQ3VzMFA0Z1d1WHV3d2p4Ui11ZE15QnVFZmxhRERpQmZzc3hkQVVFbEtqUjYtVTRTQ2JMNkdZOW0xZDRmdHdXcjZ6aGhvMUU1Z0VVbDdqZjhtSW1UaVRqOTFkNElpSFlPZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;When you go to the dentist, you’re likely focused on matters like cavities and gum health. But dental experts can detect a lot more from your exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot about someone’s overall health can be observed just by looking in their mouth,” &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk&lt;/em&gt;, told HuffPost. “In fact, over 100 systemic conditions and many medications can have oral manifestations. This means that what happens in the mouth can often be a window into broader health issues, helping to identify problems before they escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the mouth is considered the “gateway” to the body, it can also be the origin of problems in many different bodily systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth’s microbes “can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or open root canals and travel to other parts of the body, causing infections or inflammation,” Hoss noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why routine dental checkups are so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comprehensive oral examination can provide valuable insights into a person’s overall health and lifestyle habits, helping dental professionals identify potential issues and provide appropriate care and recommendations,” said cosmetic dentist &lt;a href="https://mymanhattancosmeticdentist.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael J. Wei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly can a dentist infer about you from the state of your mouth? We asked some professionals to share what they’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Floss Regularly... Or Rarely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nighttime routines like limiting alcohol and salty snacks can help support healthy blood pressure levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key habits include taking medications, practicing mindfulness, and creating a restful sleep environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small bedtime changes can boost heart health and complement diet and exercise for better blood pressure control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining healthy blood pressure is about more than keeping your doctor happy at your checkup. It is a key part of reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke and other serious health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a heart-healthy diet and exercise may come to mind, which isn’t wrong. But it’s not just about what you do by day. Your nighttime routine plays a bigger role in your heart health than you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s right! Getting ready for bed might feel like an ordinary part of your day, but did you know certain bedtime steps may be powerful medicine for better blood pressure? We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/mary-branch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Branch, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, about how to make the most of those precious pre-sleep moments to support healthy blood pressure. And trust us, it’s easier than you’d expect (no burpees required!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you hit the pillow tonight, try these five simple yet effective tips to give your blood pressure a little extra love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Limit Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, unwinding at the end of the day might include sipping on a boozy nightcap. However, if you have high blood pressure, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol &lt;/a&gt;is especially important, says Branch. “For women, it is recommended to drink no more than one drink per day, and two for men,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While alcohol may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually make it harder to manage your blood pressure over time. Even small amounts can interfere with medications or put additional strain on your heart and blood vessels. And the more you drink, the higher your blood pressure rises. The link is so strong that one study found that each additional daily drink a person had significantly increased their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? By swapping that nightcap for something like herbal tea, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067374/chamomile-tea-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sticking to water, you’re doing your body a huge favor. In addition to helping promote more stable blood pressure, you’ll give your body a hydration boost, too. Just go for caffeine-free beverage options, as caffeine may make it hard to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-remember-your-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Remember Your Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prescribed medications to treat hypertension, it is recommended that you take these medications each day,” says Branch. This includes medications you may need to take before bed. Yes, even on nights when you feel too tired to open a pill bottle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adhering to prescribed hypertension medications is crucial for effectively managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of serious health complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, as these medications work best when maintained at steady levels in your system. Skipping a dose can disrupt this balance and potentially hinder progress. Incorporating daily reminders, such as setting an alarm or using a pill organizer, can help ensure you take your medications on time. Simple steps like keeping your medications within reach, like near your bedside or in a spot you frequent, can make it easier to stay on track—even on those long days when opening a pill bottle feels like a chore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-practice-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Practice Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Branch suggests that practicing meditation and mindfulness may be a helpful bedtime habit for healthy blood pressure. “This can help bring down your stress level and your blood pressure along with it,” she says. “Furthermore, it can help you with getting a good night’s rest, which is also important for reducing blood pressure.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientific data supports these recommendations. Research highlights the link between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051058/does-stress-cause-high-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress and higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating the importance of addressing stress for overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By taking small but intentional steps toward relaxation before bed, you can set yourself up for restful sleep and a healthier tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some additional ways to manage stress before bed include practicing yoga or gentle stretching to ease muscle tension, journaling to clear your mind, and creating a calming bedtime environment by reducing noise and dimming lights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Establishing a consistent bedtime routine can further signal to your body that it’s time to wind down, creating a seamless transition to restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-avoid-high-sodium-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Avoid High-Sodium Snacks  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking can be tempting. But if you’re aiming to support healthy blood pressure, it’s crucial to steer clear of high-sodium foods before bed. Consuming salty snacks like chips, canned soups or pretzels may cause your body to retain water. This can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8700143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium &lt;/a&gt;intake in check, especially before sleep, may help stabilize your blood pressure overnight and promote better overall cardiovascular health. Opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-snacks-dietitians-love-8775716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-sodium snacks &lt;/a&gt;like fresh fruit, unsalted nuts or air-popped popcorn. They’ll satisfy your evening cravings without compromising your blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creating the right sleep environment can have a surprising impact on healthy blood pressure levels. A cool, dark, comfortable bedroom not only promotes better sleep but also may support heart health by encouraging quality sleep. Conversely, data suggests that poor sleep can lead to elevated blood pressure over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To keep your bedroom comfortable, ensure your room is dark, quiet and cool.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eliminating distractions such as bright lights or loud noises and investing in a supportive mattress and pillow may also encourage deeper, more restorative sleep. These small adjustments may help your body relax and recover from the day, contributing to better blood pressure regulation.

A Riverside man in his forties fatally overdosed on the substance in March but the cause was not officially determined until this month, the Riverside University Health System said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ruhealth.org/news/public-health-officials-confirm-first-fatal-carfentanil-overdose-riverside-county-resident#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegally manufactured fentanyl drugs  such as carfentanil entered illicit markets in the northeast U.S. as a substitute for white-powder heroin in 2013, the CDC said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7348a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Carfentanil, which is 10,000 times more potent than morphine, can be lethal at a fraction of the two milligram range for fentanyl, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every life lost from opioids is one too many,” Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Chevinsky said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of carfentanil overdoses are rare, but on the rise, the release said. U.S. deaths involving carfentanil increased from 29 in the first half of 2023 to 238 during the same period last year, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carfentanil is defined as a unique illegally manufactured fentanyl, an opioid produced without the regulations of pharmaceutical-grade fentanyl. That means it can go undetected by some fentanyl test strips, which can lead to an increase in accidental overdoses, health officials added. While overall opioid overdoses have decreased both nationally and in Riverside County, according to the release, the CDC said that the reemergence of carfentanil “may threaten this progress.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, we can continue to raise awareness about the risks associated with drug use and work as a community to support safety, reduce harm and care for one another,” Chevinsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Riverside University Health System recommended that individuals carry naloxone to treat someone overdosing on fentanyl and avoid using carfentanil even in small doses due to the unpredictability and potency of the substance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNbjMzeVZGN2w1Y1JlSmlzMTR1Q0d6bG85aWJCYWlzMkEzeHNrS0dHNWRhZi1sb0pFVEo3YVRpNFNWdG5KdHQ5Z20zQ3RnNTlwUlRKQm5oMzBXejZzeUd0MHozQ1hrLVBaSkNyN0Z6em53cDF3TjAtUDhoOUNlZ0oxcFZqRVNMN2FScU1IamJzSm1neFBLaUoyNDJHa3Vod3dxUFFlRmw3S2lZY0piaUJnWFZfMFZPVWNtNmlZcEhOQWVFanZiUS1KYVo5MWd2ZWw1Yk5qaVFhOA</guid></item><item><title>引导纳米颗粒重新连接脑细胞，提高对帕金森治疗的希望- ScienceAlert | Guided Nanoparticles Reconnect Brain Cells, Raising Hopes For Parkinson's Treatment - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNUWMwdUNXemVqYXRLY3ZoZklmTHl6bFdQQkZKbnB4YmFWdkdBZHB2bzFueTAtNVk2YXJqeDlZeWNvYU85MENYREJHRHlvQ21OZ0c3TEtyU3dkc3hnLUdiQWczRDlCQm96ZUxlQlhHYUhidFBmTERUN3AxbzhEVzRnRVFYZnRXRmdmdy0wc2RTNVlRUTQ5WUVNeVg3MUxlN1hPVlNwZjFsYU9zQk8yVnI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken connections between brain cells play a critical role in &lt;/span&gt;multiple neurodegenerative conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-"&gt;including Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have now come up with a novel way of repairing our neural wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by University of Pisa biologist Sara De Vincentiis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-mini-brains-from-stem-cells-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes"&gt;used mini-brains&lt;/a&gt; grown in a lab to test a technique they're calling "nano-pulling", using tiny magnetic particles controlled by magnetic fields to guide axons (connective nerve fibers) into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further development, the researchers believe this approach could help restore the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigrostriatal_pathway"&gt;nigrostriatal pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a vital connection in motor control that is compromised in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates the potential of nano-pulling as an emerging technique to promote directed reinnervation within the central nervous system," &lt;span&gt;the researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Parkinson's Discovery Suggests We Could Have an FDA-Approved Treatment Already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is partially the result of damage to brain cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine. Transplanting dopamine-producing tissue has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70295-8"&gt;shown some promise&lt;/a&gt; as a therapy, but these new cells struggle to hook themselves up to host brain tissue once they're in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some gentle coaxing with magnetic particles could help fix that problem, and get us another step closer to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;effective treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg" alt="Mini-brain images" class="wp-image-168128 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery-600x303.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini-brains were used to test the effects of nano-pulling. (De Vincentiis et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Sci&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nano-pulling was shown to increase axon length and get connectors moving in the right direction. It also made the cells more stable, and produced more of the axon branches and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_vesicle"&gt;synaptic vesicles&lt;/a&gt; (tiny packages of neurotransmitters) that are required to build neuron links and eventually restore the nigrostriatal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, the magnetic particles used in the experiment have been approved safe for use in medical procedures, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans. No damage was seen in the mini-brains used by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We successfully achieved guided neurite growth, resulting in increased neurite length and branching, thereby reinforcing the versatility and potential therapeutic applications of this technique," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no cure yet for Parkinson's disease, but we're getting better at understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt; and the different risk factors involved. Like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's a complex disease, and it can be difficult to distinguish between causes and the consequences of having it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work continues to find treatments that can stop Parkinson's or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-time-drug-shows-signs-of-slowing-parkinsons-disease"&gt;slow it down&lt;/a&gt;. As with this latest study, a lot of the focus is on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-may-prevent-cognitive-decline-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;protecting the brain&lt;/a&gt; from damage, and trying to get dopamine production &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nanoparticles-reverse-parkinsons-in-mice-by-healing-damaged-dopamine-cells"&gt;back up and running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent age-related neurodegenerative disease globally," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parkinson's disease prevalence has doubled over the past 25 years, with an alarming rise to 13 million patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-181474"&gt;projected by 2040&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne illness &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html"&gt;eastern equine encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; has been detected in Massachusetts for the first time this year, state health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus was detected in a mosquito sample collected on July 21 in Belchertown, the Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-eee-positive-mosquito-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said the positive test is a reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is around the time we would expect to find EEE in mosquitoes in Massachusetts, especially after an active EEE season last year with four recorded human cases,” Goldstein said. “This is only a first finding and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal infection that has no cure. The virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can trigger brain swelling, fever, and coma, and it &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2019/08/26/massachusetts-eee-death"&gt;kills approximately a third of the people who contract it&lt;/a&gt;. Survivors can face severe neurological disabilities and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/09/09/4th-human-case-of-eee-detected-in-mass/"&gt;four human cases&lt;/a&gt; of EEE in Mass last year and one person died. Four horses were also infected last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the state, no human or animal cases have been detected in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” State epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging residents to take precautions, like using insect repellent and covering up bare skin, to prevent bites. Residents can also drain standing water around their properties and install or repair screens to help reduce the risk of bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peak biting time for mosquitoes is dusk to dawn, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning in areas of high risk,” officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxORjB5WjkteWZ1NjVQTnA1ai1nVUgzVWpXNUQ5d3dXQ0k5X1FmVVNpdV9qaFdoU0lOQVU4bVZyZ05vcVFGVEFsdUFPeUd3OVJTNlI0LU9lUWhOMldidUZhYWxLaG5vaWpvc1V1aHZnS2lTVEhSYjdUekpERmZNaUZyTHE4aGlrMGtvaEEybGpKZTg2Z2pGTlJrNjBLdENzQ0NWcGJkdUExWURLS2ctQ3ZWTEdrN1c</guid></item><item><title>香蕉和苹果都没有：科学家揭示了最健康的水果，以及为什么你应该每天吃它。- evidencenetwork.ca | Neither banana nor apple: scientists reveal the healthiest fruit of all and why you should eat it every day. - evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxOY0VteTNLR2c3Wm9GVVJ5WUxUZTlkcTVoUS1odDZzMFNpQ2N3LVBxQ1NFTGN4M3JsVmExV3VYNTZJTGZYNkc1ZjctRnpONG41amE2MU12MmRhLUVWcHlnbllsdGZGU2x5TGNDbk9CVXprSGlzbUlBRmxrODNiZjdtTmdrR21oN0VhVkR4WW1CaUF1SUxOay1ZV3pvWlNFamtrZHhOTDF1ZjZuRGUxQ0VmdmcyZmRtUE5pNkRBTWkwXzdqZXB3MjhiVTlST181Qm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A small quantity of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an asset. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some people are put off by the acidic taste of lemons, there are simple ways of incorporating them into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional in the event of digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, anti-microbial and even anti-cancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/minimum-amount-exercise-prevent-cancer-100000993.html" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says.

This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-thing-never-ever-long-175000702.html" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you.

The aim has not been to create hybrid creatures but to prevent horrific disease linked to mitochondria, the microscopic power generators in the mother’s egg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mitochondrial disease is, in fact, devastating, affecting about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/mitochondrial-disease" rel&gt;1 in 7,000 live births&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

By contrast, children with mild or late-appearing symptoms can live full lives with few health setbacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid mitochondrial disease, then, the aim is to transfer the combination of mom and dad’s DNA from a fertilized egg with sick mitochondria into an egg with healthy mitochondria stripped of its own DNA.

						&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CANTON— West Nile Virus has been detected in mosquitos in the village of Canton, the St. Lawrence County Public Health Department reported Wednesday, July 23. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Public Health Department reported that routine surveillance of mosquito populations has yielded the first positive test for West Nile Virus near the Upper and Lower Lakes in the village of Canton. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Routine mosquito sampling is conducted at various locations throughout the county and tested at a state laboratory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Nile Virus is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no vaccine to prevent West Nile Virus, nor medicines to treat the disease it causes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Public Health Department issued the following guidance to avoid mosquito bites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take precautions during their peak activity hours from dusk until&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;dawn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, socks, and shoes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use mosquito repellent containing DEET, Picaridin, Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus, or IR3535. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not apply repellent directly to children; instead, apply it to your own hands and then rub it onto your child. Avoid applying to your face and wash your skin and clothing thoroughly after coming indoors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid mosquito breeding near your property, the St. Lawrence County Public Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Department advises taking the following measures: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure your roof gutters drain correctly and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;clean clogged gutters in the spring and fall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remove or turn over any items that may hold stagnant water, such as tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flowerpots, or trash containers, to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clear vegetation and waste from the edge of ponds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more information on West Nile Virus, call the St. Lawrence County Public Health Department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;at 315-386-2325 or visit the New York State Department of Health’s website &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/west_nile_virus/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or the CDC website on WNV &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The effect of the medicine goes away, and people tend to go back to where they started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Patients who had taken GLP-1s tended to lose more weight during treatment, which meant they had more weight to gain back afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It’s not that the medicine didn’t work,” Aronne said. “It’s that they lost more weight, so they had more weight to regain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Even participants who continued healthy eating and exercise habits after stopping medication experienced weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That doesn’t mean those efforts weren’t worthwhile, Aronne further explained, but rather that obesity is a chronic disease with complex biological drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You wouldn’t stop insulin and expect a person’s blood sugar to stay low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers noted several limitations, including a small number of included studies and a focus on weight and BMI without tracking other health markers like blood sugar or cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These medications may not right for everyone, and decisions about starting or stopping should be made with your doctor, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html" target="_blank"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People with certain medical conditions, including a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer, may not be good candidates, and should speak with their doctor to decide what management strategies are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Alexandra-Elise Dakaud Patterson, MD, MS, is a general surgery resident at &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.utoledo.edu/policies/utmc/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Toledo Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOSlhQSk51Q3o3Nml4T2hTSFJqRVR0cTUzVUFoXzhtT0s4MWNnZFlaNlcxYm9kX1BfbVBBdTBXeEtlY19ualRiUk5ZeWhSRUZqeVlyZy1Qb016N19jREpCSG5zMVEtQnlSMUs4VzhTOGFRZ3VCYThuOVRyZDZidjVZT01XdW80a3BJVkxsUTllRndmZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxQbmlWcUs5emRzQ3BWaFdWTm5MSWhsal8tVUtFeGdWbk9MTVJrdGdvdVc1Y3phcUU0ZjF0cXo3Z1pTb1R3YnlXbHJLZzlSYnRvWFYwYTZUQ2t6NGJ0QmdXOExRdjkwcVd5UDBNc2o5eDB0OUI0MlpORjlPY0x2ZVgyUkRHS1M5NFQ5Um0tZEtmZkdYbWwtRXg4</guid></item><item><title>几个月来，医生对女性的常见症状不屑一顾......直到他们发现她患有致命的结肠癌-每日邮报 | Doctors dismissed woman's common symptoms for months... until they discovered she had a deadly colon cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-5372d5f0-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; woman was diagnosed with deadly &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5369d540-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; after being dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rylie Toomey, 27, was in the midst of planning her wedding and training for a half marathon when she was struck with unbearable abdominal pain in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She rushed to the hospital, where doctors performed a CT scan and insisted she was just constipated before sending her home.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told her the same thing when she returned every few months for testing, until she ended up in the emergency department screaming in pain this past April. She was also suffering from a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'In my head I was like, I think I'm going to die - that's how much pain I was in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I was being stabbed, and my belly was super bloated, too. It felt like I was just going to explode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey had suffered a perforated bowel, meaning there was a hole in her intestinal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that hospital visit, another CT scan detected stage four colon cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs - and she became one of the thousands of young Americans who have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;been diagnosed with colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; despite living healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rylie Toomey, pictured here with her fiance, was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer at 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey is one of the thousands of healthy Americans under 50 to be struck by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/woman-colon-cancer-symptoms-dismissed-rcna219654"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'When you hear, "You have cancer," you're just like, that can't be right. That can't be me because leading up to this, I was so healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To hear that I had colon cancer just didn't make sense, just because you feel like colon cancer is linked to unhealthy people or people who eat unhealthy or the elderly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just was not expecting that at all.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1999 to 2018, the rate of colorectal cancer in the under-50 population rose from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses in 20- to 34-year-olds is set to increase by 90 percent between 2010 and 2030, and rates for teenagers have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14623503/common-healthy-superfood-cancer-link-surge-rates.html"&gt;diet, lack of exercise and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; have all been blamed, though these causes fail to explain why physically fit people like Toomey have increasingly been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest evidence, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;published in April&lt;/a&gt;, also suggests childhood exposure to a toxin released by E. coli bacteria could increase the risk of colorectal cancer by triggering inflammation and altering the balance of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14659567/habit-millions-daily-colon-cancer-death-rate-study.html"&gt;linked to colorectal cancer &lt;/a&gt;in a recent study, as it is thought to block tumor-suppressing cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told TODAY.com that she regularly plays lacrosse, runs and cycles and sticks to a healthy diet. She also has no family history of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey, here with her fiancé, is having treatment and has pushed her wedding back a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed like Toomey, after a bowel-related emergency often caused by the tumor growing, recent research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is now receiving chemotherapy every two weeks and regular immunotherapy infusions, with eight treatments left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment forced her to push back her wedding, which was supposed to take place last month, and schedule it for June 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It's definitely something that keeps me going right now. It's kind of hard to stay positive in situations like this, but this is something that's bringing me joy and keeping me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Friends have &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rally-for-rylie-support-rylies-fight-against-colon-cancer"&gt;set up a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is also urging other young people with symptoms to get checked out immediately and push for answers, even if doctors are dismissive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I just don't want anybody to ever go through something like this. I think this happened for a reason so I can help others.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:19:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQSkdLS1NQcjh0T2djNG16cXBEMVlPYTZhTGVSd0RlN29OQjYwRjYzQzdrYWVjazhBd1FxMFZtVUd4Z0FfeVFkcmhMcnc4M2x6dXV2dU9WVTFZa3kzSjZha05UZFRmc0hGRmExOW9JaGNNeUVjc3d3cDNjUV9CeThPaE8yYWgxTHlCTjB1S3VhZFUxZlZtMFJIZGEtZk1QN1M3NkJwaF9BTE1Ybm5oLUxzeGRCanZxQdIBuwFBVV95cUxPUnU1UWdkNWNiQXhLc1JJbEw1d1ZnT3NoeTdsSmJZaE9HaWk1TFRvZTNDODVpSlZ4emN0UUltTzdVRnhNeTdFU2poUjFwbnpfcERjWWVTVHVDcXl3NENoOFIwZXl3WHN6THRTTU5VTlgySUVrVVhkTFJmcGJhUkFTQzJsZUdDWVJKU0dDR2RLLV85TTB0MEFSQmVCeV9XOXRKdHh5WkkxUWdkUjhPbGhKZEg4dVRlT1BPUFhB</guid></item><item><title>这种实验性减肥药物在没有恶心或呕吐的情况下起作用- Gizmodo | This Experimental Weight Loss Drug Works Without the Nausea or Vomiting - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQMFJDTXFvWjVOZlZrUWFRZDhlSzlSa2U5a2JnSERhN21mU2RRSWoycWZpdXRSam1tcl9tbjQzNnhtaUpzMnVpclQ4T0dxVTNTZlVvYlBNS2pWT256WXB2U3VucDZHdjVlWVNQRVBHVjVvN05qVE82dWtmaFJiS09ZWTJqVWU3Q0s5am55NW5vWTU5UzF1b2puMHl3Q1pqQU1KT2paMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;What if you could lose weight with a drug that won’t make you lose your lunch at the same time? New research shows it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Kentucky, and other institutions say they’ve found a potentially novel way to suppress people’s appetite and treat obesity—without causing the nausea or vomiting commonly experienced with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy). In early animal experiments, the team’s experimental drug appears to be working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs&lt;/a&gt; mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which is important to regulating our insulin production and hunger. As effective as these medications are at helping people lose weight, they have their tradeoffs—most notably a high chance of gastrointestinal side effects. So there’s clearly still a need for improved obesity treatments, according to lead study author Caroline Geisler, an assistant professor at UKY’s College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geisler and her team have been exploring one particular strategy for treating obesity, involving a protein called octadecaneuropeptide, or ODN. ODN is produced by the brain’s glia, specialized cells that support neurons. But glia aren’t just the brain’s support troops, and ODN seems to be important to controlling our sense of hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Now we know that [glia] play a large role in sensing and communicating the status of the body, and we hope that by targeting a glial signaling molecule, we can engage many energy-regulating pathways in the brain and avoid the side effects of nausea and vomiting,” Geisler told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers first tested their hypothesis by delivering ODN directly to the hindbrain of rats. Once treated, the rats lost weight and improved their blood sugar control. And when they blocked ODN signaling in rats, the animals exhibited a weaker response to GLP-1 treatment (suggesting its effects are at least partly tied to ODN).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, they indirectly dosed mice, rats, and shrews with an experimental drug derived from ODN, called TDN. In mice, TDN improved blood sugar control; in rats, it caused weight loss without nausea or vomiting; and in shrews (animals commonly used to test motion sickness and vomiting), the drug triggered no puking at all. The drug also appeared to not have any noticeable effects on the animals’ heart rate, movement, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This paper shows for the first time that giving a smaller version of ODN in the periphery is still effective to improve body weight and metabolic control without side effects,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu6764"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine, are only a proof of concept for now. There remain many questions about exactly how ODN works in the brain to tamp down our appetite and control blood sugar. It’s also possible that ODN-based drugs can be further optimized for medical use, though TDN seemed to produce steady weight loss in animals for at least over a week without waning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers are hopeful this potential new drug class can match or even surpass the effectiveness of today’s GLP-1 therapies while being less of a hassle to take. And they’re now planning to develop such drugs for testing in people. “We have an optimistic timeline that we could be ready to start clinical trials within 2 years,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers are hardly the only ones working to introduce the next generation of improved obesity and diabetes treatments. But it’s likely plenty of people would sign up for a safe weight loss drug that comes without the need for a barf bag.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

This caused mice to suffer MS-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness, loss of movement and the ability to coordinate muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This mirrors the process observed in individuals with multiple sclerosis, where the myelin sheath also degrades because the immune system misfires and starts to attack the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say their findings could indicate a link between HSV-1, which is different from the HSV-2 virus that causes genital herpes, and MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deepak Shukla, a professor of molecular virology at UIC and the study’s lead, said: 'Our findings enhance our understanding of how viruses develop and offer potential avenues for mitigating viral-induced [nerve cell] damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are infected, then your immune system is constantly locked in battle with the virus. And if for any reason you become immunocompromised, the virus can escape and damage your brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have warned over a potential connection between oral herpes and multiple sclerosis (stock image, there is no suggestion that the above patient has herpes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral herpes is an extremely common condition that infects about 47 percent of adults, according to the CDC, or 124million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread via sexual contact, such as kissing and oral sex, and is incurable, normally lying dormant and triggering occasional flare-ups of sores on and around the mouth and lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cells, it is controlled by the protein optineurin, which stops an infection from spreading and protects against any potential myelin sheath damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have previously established that one of the biggest risk factors for MS is an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a virus that has infected 95 percent of adults and which is estimated to raise the risk of MS by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And other herpes viruses, like the ones that cause chickenpox, shingles, and human herpes virus 6, have also been linked to the onset and worsening of MS, which affects 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And MS is a debilitating, incurable autoimmune condition that affects the brain and spinal cord and leaves people with mobility issues, memory loss and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In earlier studies, Dr Shukla’s team found that HSV-1 triggered a strong immune response in the brains of mice, causing memory problems, poor coordination, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that the protein optineurin helps fight the virus by slowing its growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest study, researchers infected mice that could not produce the protein with the oral herpes virus in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers only tested herpes simplex virus-1, or the virus that causes oral herpes. This differs from the one that causes genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As seen in earlier cell tests, mice without optineurin had higher infection rates after four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that a protein called MLKL, or Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein, which is made by the body during cell death, boosted HSV-1 infections in the absence of optineurin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the protein facilitated the transportation of the virus into a cell's nucleus, speeding an infection, and optineurin controlled HSV-1 infection by triggering the deterioration of MLKL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Imaging studies revealed extensive clumping, or aggregation, of MLKL in the brains of optineurin-lacking mice, but not in control mice, in response to HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, these clumps appeared to trigger the death of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, or cells that create armor, or the myelin sheath, around neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the sheath, the nervous system was left vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting damage disrupts the communication between the brain and the rest of the body, leading to the various symptoms associated with MS, such as weakness in the legs, fatigue, coordination problems, cognitive changes, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Identifying this protein offers a new target for multiple sclerosis therapies. Already, Shukla’s lab has demonstrated that necrosulfonamide, which inhibits optineurin, can preserve nerve function in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies like these provide hope for the future of MS, and bring about the potential to enable earlier intervention or a possible cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making up about 25 percent of all lung cancer cases - approximately 58,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to his local hospital six weeks after he noticed painful swelling in his right middle finger and right big toe, giving them a club-like shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors, who recounted the man's case in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2501158"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that each tip of the affected digits were red, swollen and sensitive to touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ulcer - an open sore or raw area - had formed near the nail of the toe, turning it bright yellow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans showed that the hand and foot contained 'destructive lytic lesions,' areas of the bone where tissue had been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the man's case, the empty space has been 'completely replaced' by more tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a form of x-ray called a radiograph, doctors diagnosed the man with acrometastasis, a rare instance in which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14725211/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-health.html"&gt;cancer spreads to bones&lt;/a&gt; below the elbow or knee like the hands or feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the man's finger (left) and his toe (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows X-rays of the man's finger (left) and toe (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrometastases only account for about 0.1 percent of cancer cases that have spread to the bones, recent studies suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, like the man's, it's seen in patients who already have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in some instances, symptoms of acrometastasis are the first signs of undiagnosed cancers, such as those in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, genital and urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also much more common in men than women, a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8471162/"&gt;2021 review&lt;/a&gt; suggests, largely because lung cancer is more prevalent in men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, cancer that has spread to the fingers and toes reacts like gout or osteomyelitis - a bone infection - which cause inflammation, redness and swelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that acrometastases are so rare because, in most cases, cancer cells are drawn to bone marrow, which is found in the long bones of the arms, legs, ribs, backbone, breastbone and pelvis. Finger and toe bones, by contrast, contain much less marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The unnamed man suffered from an aggressive form of lung cancer, doctors said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the further a bone is from the heart, the less blood it gets. Lower blood flow makes it harder for cancer cells to reach the fingertips or toes, so acrometastases happen there far less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrometastases have a grim prognosis because they are generally found in advanced cancer cases. They have been associated with less than six months of survival time after diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are typically given medications to manage their pain rather than cure the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the man's case, doctors started with palliative radiotherapy, which focuses on pain relief from cancer that has spread to the bone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died three weeks later from refractory hypercalcemia, dangerously high calcium levels in the blood that don't respond to treatment, a common  complication in cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;New research has linked exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and Type 2 diabetes -- a finding that could have implications for military personnel and families who work around or live on installations contaminated by the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small study of patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City found that individuals with higher levels of PFAS in their bloodstreams were more at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. According to the research, published Monday in the eBioMedicine journal, increases in a range of PFAS exposure was associated with a 31% increased risk of developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-688220682d5b5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-688220682d5b7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often referred to as "forever chemicals" because they do not break down naturally in the environment, the man-made substances are used in commercial products such as non-stick cookware, food packaging, cosmetics and stain repellents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Next: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/07/22/army-eyeing-replacement-m240b-machine-gun.html"&gt;Army Eyeing Replacement for M240B Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also have widespread industrial use in lubricants; coatings; electronics; textiles, including flame retardant materials; firefighting foam; and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-688220682d75d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-688220682d75f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces"&gt;armed forces&lt;/a&gt; have used aqueous film forming foam to fight fires for decades and, while the services have been phasing it out as directed by Congress, it remains in use on oceangoing vessels, where the risk of fire poses a significant threat to personnel and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of installations also have been contaminated with the chemicals after years of long-term use in training and operations. A Defense Department review of 723 installations and former military sites &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/12/27/inside-pentagons-painfully-slow-effort-clean-decades-of-pfas-contamination.html"&gt;found that 581 required some degree of remediation and cleanup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body does not use insulin, which is made by the pancreas, correctly and sugar accumulates in the blood. Over time, if not treated, it can cause organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small study involved 180 patients at Mount Sinai who were recently diagnosed with diabetes and compared them to 180 similar individuals without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that the association could result from irregularities in amino acid biosynthesis and drug metabolism, disrupting the body's ability to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Vishal Midya, an assistant professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the study is one of the first to explore how the chemicals may disrupt the body's metabolism in ways that increase diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We divided persons in four different groups [based on the level of PFAS measured in their blood. The results showed that] if exposure goes from one group to another, with the group four being maximum [exposure], the risk of Type 2 diabetes increases by 30%," Midya said during an interview with Military.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research did not prove that PFAS contamination was the cause of the condition but did show the two have an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been some literature, particularly animal studies, showing that PFAS actually can cause Type 2 diabetes in animal models, but we had never seen anything like that in a usual, normal population," Midya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients reviewed in the study were not in jobs normally associated with high PFAS exposure. They were regular New Yorkers who likely were exposed through their drinking water or food packaging, Midya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, they all had some level of PFAS in their bloodstreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It surprised me, the fact that we found PFAS in all the people," Midya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to PFAS has been linked to health issues such as decreased response to vaccines, kidney cancer and low birth weight, but the research proving a direct link has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study released in 2023 showed a direct connection between perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, or PFOS, a type of PFAS chemical, and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pioneering-study-links-testicular-cancer-among-military-personnel-to-forever-chemicals/"&gt;testicular cancer in military firefighters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first to really measure PFAS levels in a U.S. military population and examine the chemicals' ties to cancer, according to the study co-author Mark Purdue, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little can be done to reduce the levels of PFAS in one's bloodstream, as they accumulate over time and are not processed by body systems. An Australian study published in 2022 found that firefighters with high levels of PFAS were able to &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-exposure-military-firefighters-unknowns/"&gt;reduce their numbers by 10% by donating blood every 12 weeks, or by 30%&lt;/a&gt; if they donated plasma every six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that blood tests for PFAS levels are not standard, the best one can do to reduce the likelihood of developing a PFAS-linked illness is to reduce one's exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means being mindful about drinking water, choosing any option that has been filtered to reduce PFAS chemicals, reducing the use of non-stick cookware, using PFAS-free cleaning products, and checking labels on personal care products and cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are ways we can reduce exposure, but we really can't make it zero," Midya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The services have been switching over to fluorine-free firefighting foam on installations, but the Defense Department announced in May that it would need an extension to Oct. 1, 2026, to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the DoD, it has six products available that meet military specifications for firefighting but must adapt more than 1,000 facilities and 6,000 pieces of mobile firefighting equipment to accommodate the new foams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the diabetes research said a larger study would be helpful in supporting the findings of their research but added that the information can be useful to understand the impact of PFAS on public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Findings can help us design more effective interventions for the early prevention of Type 2 diabetes in the future, taking into account individuals' exposures to environmental chemicals, along with other well-known genetic, clinical and lifestyle factors implicated in diabetes development," Dr. Damaskini Valvi, associate professor of public health and environmental medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/07/16/defense-department-expected-request-2-year-extension-firefighting-foam-containing-forever-chemicals.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pentagon Likely to Continue Using PFAS-Based Firefighting Foam for 2 More Years, Watchdog Says&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Specialized cells called neuropods in the colon detect a bacterial protein, flagellin, and signal the brain via the vagus nerve to suppress eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice lacking the receptor for this signal kept eating and gained weight, highlighting the pathway’s role in appetite control. This breakthrough suggests our gut microbes can directly influence behavior and opens avenues to study diet, obesity, and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neuropods sense gut microbes and signal the brain to regulate appetite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bacterial protein flagellin triggers this real-time gut-to-brain communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disruption of the pathway alters eating behavior and weight gain in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Duke University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a breakthrough that reimagines the way the gut and brain communicate, researchers have uncovered what they call a “neurobiotic sense,” a newly identified system that lets the brain respond in real time to signals from microbes living in our gut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, led by Duke University School of Medicine neuroscientists Diego Bohórquez, PhD, and M. Maya Kaelberer, PhD, and published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, centers on neuropods, tiny sensor cells lining the colon’s epithelium. These cells detect a common microbial protein and send rapid messages to the brain that help curb appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is just the beginning. The team believes this neurobiotic sense may be a broader platform for understanding how gut detects microbes, influencing everything from eating habits to mood — and even how the brain might shape the microbiome in return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time,” said Bohórquez, a professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University School of Medicine and senior author of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key player is flagellin, an ancient protein found in bacterial flagella, a tail-like structure that bacteria use to swim. When we eat, some gut bacteria release flagellin. Neuropods detect it, with help from a receptor called TLR5, and fire off a message through the vagus nerve – a major communication line of communication between the gut and the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, supported by the National Institutes of Health, proposed a bold idea: that bacterial flagellin in the colon could trigger neuropods to send an appetite-suppressing signal to the brain — a direct microbial influence on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested this by fasting mice overnight, then giving them a small dose of flagellin directly to the colon. Those mice ate less.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers tried the same experiment in mice missing the TLR5 receptor, nothing changed. The mice kept eating and gained weight, a clue that the pathway helps regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that flagellin sends a “we’ve had enough” signal through TLR5, allowing the gut to tell the brain it’s time to stop eating. Without that receptor, the message doesn’t get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was guided by lead study authors Winston Liu, MD, PhD, Emily Alway, both graduate students of the Medical Scientist Training Program, and postdoctoral fellow Naama Reicher, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments reveal that disrupting the pathway altered eating habits in mice pointed to a deeper link between gut microbes and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” said Bohórquez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut. That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like obesity or psychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#096f6d62496d7c626c276c6d7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fedor Kossakovski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="tps://duke.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Fedor Kossakovski – Duke University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A gut sense for a microbial pattern regulates feeding&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego Bohórquez et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A gut sense for a microbial pattern regulates feeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To coexist with its resident microorganisms, the host must have a sense to adjust its behaviour in response to them. In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:16:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE10NU1ScHVwLU5Ydk5pS0h0SEo2UHI3eWgxY3piSzVvZXZLX2dmSlNobzBJTy1JbjNFRnhfWjVNbENSS1hSUVFkV1FPZkRjdFFLbllWZTFPbGMwZjFuUmZrYzJlWVJnZ3JrZnYtSFhYeTZqOC1x</guid></item><item><title>护士通过减肥手术、饮食、举重减掉270磅- TODAY.com | Nurse Loses 270 Pounds With Bariatric Surgery, Diet, Lifting - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPejA0by1VcWR3aThPMkZqcnFiWWUwank1VVhRZUYyNVVLR0F3R2JMajlvcVdveTdyRWVRM1lVaFlxekJYUGxiRjYwOUlHenJya0pzb3M4VE04V2xEQWlrMENzZHZzdFpILXREYWhvOEJJLUtiY3FnQmNtVGptaHNBT2x6c1pPcVVTRDk4UFUzbzRWWHRzYnNpa255Y0VOMkUzNXpqRVFIdkRlZ9IBVEFVX3lxTE0xdkNLTDRFdy1jWkwwbFoxRzgwSFpkYUM4VzJVbW9La2JhVXhhVFpBekRBMEFXN2xMS1hjaDA5NXJpNEZFTGt5ZmtKUUZvY1lERzdxZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85e230" class="body-graf"&gt;When his doctor prescribed the first blood pressure medication, Kevin Goode knew his weight probably contributed to it.

The doctor advised Goode that he needed to lose weight before he qualified for surgery. He immediately headed to the gym and sat on a bench to lift some dumbbells. Soon, he started eating a moderate-fat, low-carbohydrate and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-foods-rcna130229" target="_blank"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2aedd3" class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) wanted me to lose 20 pounds because that would show that I was dedicated enough for surgery,” Goode explains. “I ended up losing 80 pounds.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94bf89" class="body-graf"&gt;In December 2023, he underwent surgery.

One of the trainers in the gym approached Goode and suggested he consider participating in a bodybuilding competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c02f4d" class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like ‘Have you ever thought about doing a show?’ and I was like, ‘No, I just love it here and I come for the health aspect,’” Goode recalls. “That’s when I looked into the transformation competition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dca970" class="body-graf"&gt;A transformation competition generally focuses on people who have lost weight. Goode will compete in October in Chicago. As part of his preparation, he has focused more on lifting and less on cardiovascular exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c2f8e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Instead of doing 45 minutes of strength training and 30 of cardio, it’s more like an hour strength training and maybe 15 minutes cardio,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d4c9d" class="body-graf"&gt;This caused him to gain some weight, and he’s now at 210 pounds, but it’s “more muscle.” His diet has changed, too, and he focuses on counting macronutrients. He still eats a lot of protein, but with lower-fat foods and now incorporates complex carbohydrates into his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad7ca6" class="body-graf"&gt;Losing fat while gaining muscle has changed his outlook on calories and how important they are for energy, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2fd10b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1759"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg" alt="Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Goode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-768d16" class="body-graf"&gt;Since losing weight and transforming his body with lifting, Goode feels he’s become “more emotionally intelligent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b147" class="body-graf"&gt;“I share a lot more about myself,” he says. “I’m 20 times more confident than I have ever been in my life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9397c2" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead, Goode shares what worked for him when it came to transforming his body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-122586" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Nutrition Is Going To Be Your Biggest Thing’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b4ee1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating fewer calories than he burned, what’s known as a calorie deficit, helped Goode shed the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7e8d6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Nutrition is going to be your biggest thing,” he says. “The biggest advice as far as actually losing weight is just (being in) a calorie deficit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-90506a" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Fall in Love with the Small Wins’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13713b" class="body-graf"&gt;Focusing too much on the scale can feel overwhelming.

But of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the 70 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the United States over the past 18 months, only a single death occurred, leaving experts &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/02/bird-flu-h5n1-mild-cases-mystery/"&gt;puzzled at how to explain the phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study published Wednesday adds weight to an argument that the immunity people have developed to the virus that caused the most recent flu pandemic, an H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009, has induced some cross-protection that may be making it harder for H5N1 to infect people, and mitigating the severity of the ensuing disease when such infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw4856" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, reports on a number of studies done in ferrets, the closest animal model for what happens when humans are infected with influenza. It showed that while H5N1 is lethal to ferrets with no immunity to influenza, animals that have previously been infected with influenza A — either H3N2 or H1N1 — appear to have some protection when they are later exposed to the bird flu virus. The protection is particularly strong with H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seema Lakdawala, one of the authors of the study, said the findings provide hope that, should H5N1 — long considered a major pandemic threat — acquire the ability to spread easily to and among humans, the resulting pandemic might not be as disastrous as people have feared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, most people will not die when they come into contact with the virus because they have some prior H1 immunity from infection or an H3N2 immunity from infection,” Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology and co-director of Emory University’s Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens, told STAT in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Traditionally influenza research in ferrets has been done in naive animals — those that have never been exposed to flu viruses. But increasingly scientists are using animals that have experienced previous flu infections, because they more closely resemble what might happen with humans during infection. People experience numerous exposures to flu viruses — or flu vaccines — over the course of a lifetime, building up an array of immune defenses to the ubiquitous viruses. But flu viruses evolve constantly, acquiring the ability to evade human immunity in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this study, which was done primarily by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University, blood from ferrets that had recovered from infection with one type of flu virus — H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B — was studied to see if the animals had developed antibodies that would react to and potentially protect against H5N1 viruses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, animals were sequentially infected with various combinations of two of the three types of viruses, to see if some combinations developed more robust immunity to H5N1 than others. Influenza B viruses appeared to offer no protection, but ferrets infected with the two influenza A viruses fared better against H5N1, which is also a flu A virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the surface proteins of H1N1, the neuraminidase or N in its name, bears some similarities to the neuraminidase carried by H5N1 viruses, leading some experts to theorize that it might offer some cross-protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/1/23-0756_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A study published last year&lt;/a&gt; by scientists in Hong Kong explored the idea, looking for antibodies that recognized H5N1 in the blood of people who had been infected with the H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009. Most of the samples tested had high levels of cross-reacting antibodies. By comparison, fewer than half of blood samples stored from before the 2009 pandemic had low levels of antibodies that responded to H5N1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of that paper, said the new research and other recent studies support the idea that previous infection with H1N1 induces some protection against H5N1. But this study cannot determine what the mechanism for that protection is, he noted. More research on this is needed, Peiris said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Troy Sutton, one of the senior authors of the new paper, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say to you ‘This is the protein. This is the magic one,’” Sutton, a virologist and associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State, said in an interview. “When you get infected with a flu virus, there are multiple immune mechanisms involved in clearing that virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While all of the experts who spoke with STAT about the paper described the research in glowing terms, not everyone is convinced human immunity to the seasonal flu virus H1N1 explains the relative lack of severe disease in the H5N1 infections in the U.S. over the past year and a half, as the virus has moved through dairy cattle and poultry operations in multiple parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a leading influenza scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is among those who are skeptical, pointing to H5N1 infections in Cambodia, which has reported &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON575#:~:text=Between%201%20January%20and%201,influenza%20A(H5N1)%20virus." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;27 cases since 2023&lt;/a&gt;, 12 of which have been fatal. The version of the virus circulating in that country is different from the one that has been infecting cows and poultry in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawaoka believes a number of other factors may explain differences in the severity of cases, including differences in the viruses, the way dairy workers and poultry cullers are being infected — often, it seems, with virus entering their eyes — or the ages and underlying health of the people who are being infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, a flu expert who heads the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/global-impact/influenza-research-response/world-health-organization-collaborating-center-influenza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collaborating center on influenza in animals&lt;/a&gt; at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, shares Kawaoka’s views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to downplay the study because it’s an important study. But it’s just explaining a part of the puzzle. It’s absolutely not explaining everything we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that seasonal influenza viruses transmit just fine in the human population where there is a lot of preexisting immunity. So preexisting immunity in its own right is not enough to prevent an influenza virus from transmitting through the population.” &lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/div&gt;
						
					&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;Still, Webby acknowledged that some protection from H1N1 may be helping to keep H5N1 from making more inroads into humans. “It may be critical at this early stage where there’s a very high barrier that the virus has to overcome to infect humans. And having this preexisting immunity just makes it that little bit higher than it would be in its absence,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study as well as experts who were not involved with the work all agreed that regardless of whether immunity to H1N1 is helping to protect people from H5N1, it would be unwise to assume the threat from the bird flu virus has been vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Sutton and Peiris noted that the last two flu pandemics — the 1968 H3N2 pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic — emerged at a time when most humans had some immunity to either part of the pandemic virus or to a related virus. Prior to 1968, H2N2 viruses circulated. And prior to 2009, different H1N1 viruses circulated for 80 of the previous 91 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pandemics — the 2009 pandemic and the 1968 pandemic — both those pandemics occurred in the context of widespread preexisting immunity,” Sutton noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lakdawala also pointed out that while ferrets can answer some questions about influenza, they cannot fully replicate what would happen if a new flu virus entered a population of humans, infecting the old and the young, people battling cancer, or chronic illnesses like diabetes or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Sutton noted that flu viruses are always changing, which could mean something seen now, with contemporary versions of the virus, might only be true now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this work to me says, yes, preexisting immunity seems to be a factor in protecting against infection and disease, the virus with a few changes could potentially get around that,” he said. “These viruses have very clearly shown an ability to expand their host range.

Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor (if possible), followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The disease &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/john-mccain-brain-cancer-journey-glioblastoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is considered a highly invasive tumor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;is considered a highly invasive tumor&lt;/a&gt; in the central nervous system because its cells reproduce extremely quickly. Those who are diagnosed with the malignant tumor have a median survival rate of about 14 to 14.5 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his diagnosis, Trotman was referred by a friend to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at University College London Hospitals (UCLH). There, Dr. Paul Mulholland, a consultant medical oncologist, recruited Trotman to be the first patient in his clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved him receiving the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab to treat his glioblastoma before undergoing any standard treatment. Afterward, Trotman began radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” Mulholland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Ben and Emily Trotman&lt;/p&gt; Ben and Emily Trotman on their wedding day in 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months after being the sole participant in the clinical trial, Trotman, now 43, is tumor-free, and his scans have come back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumour that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland explained. “We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumour at bay, and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulholland added that his goal is to find a cure for the “devastating disease” that is glioblastoma, and he’s hoping to move forward with additional patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trotman is now married to wife Emily, and the couple welcomed daughter Mabel in April. The couple told the hospital that the clinical trial gave Trotman his life back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” Emily said. “We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. Had we not met Dr. Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We obviously don’t know what the future holds, but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,” Trotman added. “We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new father said he’s hoping that his brain cancer journey will give others hope and inspire more patients to participate in the next clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/p&gt; Dr. Paul Mulholland and Dame Siobhain McDonagh&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/people/id6740392789" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The PEOPLE App&lt;/a&gt; is now available in the Apple App Store!

I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret’s Trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullholland recalled meeting Margaret. “When I met Margaret, she said to me, ‘What can I do to support you to cure this disease?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am incredibly grateful to her and to Siobhain, whose campaigning and fundraising in her sister’s memory has led to this new clinical trial opening for patients with this most aggressive form of brain cancer that has such a poor prognosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-s-deadly-brain-tumor-vanishes-after-taking-breakthrough-drug-11776891" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5MWWp3UXNxazkwU2dXQmlialVmSWNueVNBcUgzZHFXZmZNdEFVQWJFQ2VvR1dtb3BCeHg1TGVMSm93Ymp5ZGgxdVExcmtUTURqTGdGb001cHV1OHphdVkxYTZKZEdLNS1TREsyQ3RoODh0Sk5qOVBBVmJQOFY</guid></item><item><title>医院表示，儿童在感染脑吞噬变形虫后死亡- WSB-TV | Child dies after contracting brain-eating amoeba, hospital says - WSB-TV</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSB-TV</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:56:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
