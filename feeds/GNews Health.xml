&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Researchers at Kyushu University have developed a revolutionary organic molecule that acts as a “switch” for both OLEDs and medical imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 The molecule, named CzTRZCN, combines &lt;strong&gt;thermally activated delayed fluorescence&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;two-photon absorption&lt;/strong&gt; to enhance efficiency in displays and imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🖥️ CzTRZCN achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% in OLED applications, highlighting its potential for brighter and more energy-efficient screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 The molecule’s metal-free, low-toxicity nature makes it highly &lt;strong&gt;biocompatible&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for safer and sharper &lt;strong&gt;medical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers at Kyushu University have unveiled an innovative organic molecule capable of transforming both OLED displays and medical imaging technologies. This dual-function molecule acts as a “switch,” shifting its structure to emit light for displays and absorb light for deep-tissue imaging. This discovery could revolutionize consumer electronics and biomedical diagnostics, merging two previously separate technological worlds. With the potential to power brighter screens and enable safer medical imaging, this advancement represents a significant leap forward in material science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revolutionizing OLED and Medical Imaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OLED displays, celebrated for their vibrant colors and energy efficiency, utilize materials that emit light through a process called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). TADF improves efficiency by converting triplet-state energy, which is typically wasted, into light-emitting singlet states. This process enhances display brightness and reduces energy consumption. In contrast, deep-tissue medical imaging demands materials that absorb low-energy, near-infrared light to minimize cellular damage and improve imaging precision. Two-photon absorption (2PA) enables this by allowing a molecule to absorb two lower-energy photons simultaneously, focusing on tissue at the laser’s focal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining TADF and 2PA in a single molecule has been a longstanding challenge due to their conflicting structural requirements. TADF benefits from twisted molecular structures with separated electron orbitals, while 2PA requires planar structures with overlapping orbitals. This makes dual-function molecules exceedingly rare. The Kyushu University team has tackled this challenge by creating a molecule, CzTRZCN, that combines an electron-rich carbazole unit with an electron-deficient triazine core. Cyano groups further adjust the orbital arrangement, allowing the molecule to act as a “switch” between its roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vcV2TWPZMT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/microsofts-1-billion-quantum-leap-theyre-playing-god-in-denmark-igniting-fears-of-tech-tyranny-and-global-power-struggles/"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 Billion Quantum Leap: “They’re Playing God” in Denmark, Igniting Fears of Tech Tyranny and Global Power Struggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakthrough in Dual-Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative molecule, CzTRZCN, demonstrates its dual functionality through theoretical calculations and practical experiments. In OLED applications, it achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% for triazine-based TADF materials. Its high 2PA cross-section and brightness make it an excellent candidate for medical imaging. The non-metallic, low-toxicity nature of CzTRZCN enhances its biocompatibility, making it suitable for use in medical probes and imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This metal-free, low-toxicity molecule is ideal for medical probes,” said lead researcher Youhei Chitose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/virginia-techs-600k-robot-can-now-make-pizza-as-engineers-say-this-could-finally-give-millions-with-disabilities-their-independence-back/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team emphasizes the potential impact of time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, which could greatly benefit from this material’s capabilities. By successfully integrating strong TADF and high 2PA, the molecule promises to bridge the gap between photoelectronics and bioimaging, offering new possibilities for combined consumer electronics and healthcare applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Future Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study from Kyushu University outlines a strategy for designing molecules with distinct orbital arrangements for light absorption and emission. This approach could inspire the creation of multifunctional materials, extending beyond current medical and display uses. The research team aims to expand the molecule’s design to cover a broader range of emission wavelengths and is seeking collaborations with biomedical and device engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 A new wearable patch offers real-time blood pressure monitoring, revolutionizing how &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt; is managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 The device uses &lt;strong&gt;liquid metal&lt;/strong&gt; sensors and laser sintering to achieve precise measurements and high durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏃‍♂️ Suitable for patients and athletes, the patch provides continuous tracking, outperforming traditional &lt;strong&gt;cuff-based&lt;/strong&gt; monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📡 Researchers are integrating &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; and wireless technology to enhance accessibility and functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development in the field of medical technology, researchers have unveiled an innovative wearable patch designed to monitor blood pressure in real time. This device, a skin-mounted electronic patch, promises to revolutionize how hypertension is tracked and managed in daily life. As high blood pressure continues to affect more than 1.3 billion people globally, with only a small fraction effectively managing the condition, this new technology could be a game changer. The device’s ability to provide continuous monitoring and deliver hospital-grade accuracy could transform healthcare practices and enhance patient outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How the Patch Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new patch, similar in appearance to a bandage, offers a fresh approach to measuring blood pressure. Unlike traditional cuff-based monitors that are bulky and require inflation, this patch records the slight delay between the heart’s electrical signals and the mechanical pulse as blood flows through the arteries. The delay shortens when blood pressure rises and lengthens when it falls, providing an accurate measure of blood pressure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture these subtle movements on the skin, the patch utilizes a highly sensitive, flexible sensor made from liquid metal. This material remains fluid at room temperature, conducts electricity effectively, and possesses elasticity akin to human skin. Despite the challenges posed by its high surface tension, researchers successfully employed laser sintering to shape the liquid metal into precise circuits necessary for the patch’s function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cNaBYepRWA"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/this-is-the-coffee-maker-pc-you-wont-believe-exists-doug-macdowells-coffeematic-pc-uses-hot-brew-to-cool-its-cpu-in-stunning-tech-mashup/"&gt;“This Is The Coffee Maker PC You Won’t Believe Exists” Doug MacDowell’s Coffeematic PC Uses Hot Brew To Cool Its CPU In Stunning Tech Mashup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unmatched Durability and Precision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features of this patch is its durability. It can stretch up to seven times its original length and withstand over 10,000 cycles of stretching without performance degradation. In rigorous tests, the patch demonstrated superior accuracy in tracking rapid blood pressure changes, especially during and after exercise, outperforming conventional cuffs. This level of precision challenges the notion that blood pressure should only be measured during clinical visits and opens up new possibilities for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch holds promise not only for general use but also for specific applications such as intensive care monitoring and workplace safety. It provides a convenient solution for patients with hypertension, allowing them to track their condition easily throughout the day. Additionally, athletes and fitness enthusiasts may find value in monitoring how their blood pressure responds to various training routines.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.prevention.va.gov/Healthy_Living/Limit_Alcohol.asp" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says that if you want to stay within &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-year-unhealthy-moderate-drinking-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;healthy limits&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn't exceed more than seven drinks a week (one a day) if you're a woman and 14 (two a day) if you're a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a caveat, though: you should avoid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/123-drinking-rule-how-much-alcohol-too-much" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, defined as four or more drinks per occasion for women and people over 65, and five drinks for men. Yaranov said some of the "sickest hearts" he's seen in younger patients in those who drink too much at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patients "don't necessarily drink daily, but they go hard on the weekends," he said. Some might even stay sober throughout the week, working out every day and eating a balanced diet. But "this one day of heavy alcohol use, it's not going to go unnoticed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/how-does-alcohol-affect-the-heart" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; can cause a host of heart problems, from abnormal heart rhythms and heightened blood pressure to a greater risk of developing heart disease. The most common alcohol-related issue Yaranov sees is dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the heart's lower chambers become enlarged and weakened, unable to pump blood properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it's better to have a mid-week glass of wine than pound back shots on a Saturday night, Yaranov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1390c3be-a65e-4822-afc1-ebb30a4d03b8" data-toc-id="1390c3be-a65e-4822-afc1-ebb30a4d03b8"&gt;In some cases, smoking weed&lt;/h2&gt;

It's also difficult for researchers to isolate cannabis from other substance use, such as alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Yaranov said he sees lots of younger patients with heart issues who otherwise have no risk factors except for heavy marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With cannabis use as a daily habit, I think it's important for us to have this conversation now," he said. "A lot of times, this comes from this idea that it's harmless because it's an herb. I don't think that's the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8be9722b-ee79-44c2-8bb3-04d90008e6da" data-toc-id="8be9722b-ee79-44c2-8bb3-04d90008e6da"&gt;Pushing your workouts to the extreme&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Yaranov said that endurance athletes can experience "athlete's heart," a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-over-exercise-does-body-brain-health-2018-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;remodeling of their heart&lt;/a&gt;, with some heart muscles thickening to adapt to high-intensity training. While athlete's heart isn't itself dangerous, it can mask or mimic more serious heart conditions, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sports-stars-who-cardiac-arrest-on-field-like-damar-hamlin-2023-1#marc-vivien-fo-died-during-a-2003-semifinal-match-from-an-undiagnosed-heart-condition-the-first-of-several-high-profile-soccer-deaths-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic condition that causes thickened heart walls and can lead to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/cardiac-arrest-vs-heart-attack" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this is very rare — you're more at risk of athlete's heart if you're a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-anti-covid-vaccine-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;highly skilled athlete&lt;/a&gt; than if you just went too hard at the gym a few times. The bigger heart issues might stem more from the rise-and-grind lifestyle of working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person frequently foregoes sleep to squeeze in those 5 a.m. workouts, they're increasing inflammation in their body, which is directly tied to cardiovascular risk. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sleep-in-longer-healthier-life-according-to-science-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; can also elevate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/health-effects-of-stress-2017-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to excess cortisol production, blood pressure elevation, and greater visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaranov said that healthy stress and sleep levels are harder to quantitatively measure than, say, your cholesterol. People also vary in what &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sleep-doctor-chronotypes-daily-routine-2019-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sleep schedules&lt;/a&gt; work for them or in how they &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/landed-6-figure-government-job-after-military-stress-management-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;channel stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it hurts you, but we don't know how much stress is enough to hurt you," he said.

Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to retract a large Danish study that found that aluminum ingredients in vaccines do not increase health risks for children, the journal's editor told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy has long promoted doubts about vaccines' safety and efficacy, and as health secretary has upended the federal government's process for recommending immunization. A recent media report said he has been considering whether to initiate a review of shots that contain aluminum, which he says are linked to autoimmune diseases and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study, which was funded by the Danish government and published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed nationwide registry data for more than 1.2 million children over more than two decades. It did not find evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines had caused an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The work is by far the best available evidence on the question of the safety of aluminum in vaccines, said Adam Finn, a childhood vaccination expert in the UK and pediatrician at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's solid, (a) massive dataset and high-quality data," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy described the research as "a deceitful propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry," and said the scientists who authored it had "meticulously designed it not to find harm" in a detailed Aug. 1 opinion piece on TrialSite News, an independent website focused on clinical research. He called on the journal to "immediately retract" the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I see no reason for retraction," Dr. Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy's piece, which was not submitted to the Annals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies - especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before," Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. "I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy had a number of critiques, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions - including those with the highest levels of exposure - and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact he said, its design was based on a study led by Matthew Daley, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There was no control group because in Denmark, only 2% of children are unvaccinated, which is too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data is available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data is not released under Danish law, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children's Health Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, "they do not invalidate what they found, and there's no evidence of scientific misconduct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An HHS spokesman said the department had "no further comment than what the secretary said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman in New York and Jennifer Rigby in London; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Caroline Humer and Mark Porter)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 10:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPQjZfWGt6X2Fvcm83VDA0VHRhckRWOGZDVW85c2hSc3p0MlNaMTFoZWF2RVpnWUFGZ2Q1cExCc2lpMnppQ1NvY1RjUHowTHZEZ04tR0RDbVJhTmRhcWtRZ004NEVjNGdRYlZ0T2lfSzdfS3VmeHNEem1XMVNRQ2g1b3hiajB5OXktY1NZ</guid></item><item><title>在对布洛芬的可怕反应使她处于昏迷状态后，妈妈的脸“脱落” - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQcXdZZUhyWDFaM1RFdEE0enU3OVlQaENHS0h3NFoybWlJRjZvM1h3elMwQ1lSWXlhTnZiWURmUjdhSlNTWDVYd21jdWsyWkRKbEVFZUd1MlRRWVk1WjRyTlo2RmpDV3dtNldxc3BoSk0yMnFUUVpmMWhJMElJMEJiNVhuUjg5UEQ5V2dxVUFKMnNwaUpzU1hzenU2eXdHQmx3RVFWTS10S09QRUF6VEl5LWJZYW8tREk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This article contains graphic images which some readers may find distressing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A woman suffered a nightmarish response to pain medication after giving birth to her third child five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Having come through &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/parenting"&gt;an emergency C-section&lt;/a&gt;, Aleshia Rogers was three weeks into an ibuprofen-fuelled recovery when her face began to swell and a rash appeared all over her chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The Nebraskan mum was informed by &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;doctors&lt;/a&gt; that it was either a case of scarlet fever or pink eye and was told to continue taking the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;painkiller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Just hours later though, Aleshia's facial skin was ravaged by blisters, leaving her unrecognisable to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Aleshia Rogers was left unrecognisable to her loved ones (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Immediately rushing back to A&amp;amp;E, the child and education technician was then diagnosed with a rare condition known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) before being transferred to an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;SJS is reaction where the immune system sparks widespread inflammation in response to a medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The 27-year-old had to be put into a medically-induced coma to fight off sepsis and multi-organ failure, while the medics gave her a five-to-10 percent chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Her loved ones were put through three weeks of agonising uncertainty before Aleshia finally awoke from her coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Her face slowly 'burnt away' after an adverse ibuprofen reaction (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We believe it was all triggered by taking ibuprofen.

A major analysis of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40699583/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;CARDIA &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;participants found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — things like brisk walking, cycling or swimming — often starts a steady decline about 12 years before a cardiovascular diagnosis, with the pace accelerating in the final two years. Experts including Dr. Sudhir Kumar (Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad) warn that this gradual loss of stamina is frequently misread as normal ageing; spotting it early creates a large window for prevention, screening and targeted lifestyle or medical interventions that can avert major cardiac events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical activity often starts falling 12 years before heart disease: Study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper titled “Trajectories of Physical Activity Before and After Cardiovascular Disease Events in CARDIA Participants” analysed physical activity data collected across decades from participants first enrolled in 1985–86. Researchers used repeated activity assessments (multiple timepoints through midlife) to model long-term trajectories and compare people who later developed cardiovascular disease (CVD) with those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key quantitative findings: MVPA began to decline, on average, roughly 12 years before a first CVD event; declines steeped in the two years immediately before diagnosis; and low activity levels tended to persist after the event, widening the gap versus peers who remained CVD-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used CARDIA’s longitudinal design to reveal this long preclinical window rather than a single cross-sectional snapshot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARDIA tracked moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — activities that raise heart rate and breathing noticeably (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, sports). In practice, MVPA estimates came from validated activity questionnaires administered repeatedly; these give a life-course view rather than a one-off reading. Because changes emerged gradually over a decade, the timing matters: a single clinic visit that notes “low activity today” can miss whether someone is on a downward trajectory. Longitudinal decline, especially an accelerating fall in MVPA is the important signal researchers flagged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes that raise &lt;keyword id="117152" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-disease-risk" source="Orion"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sustained drop in MVPA is not just a lifestyle statistic; it maps to several physiologic changes that raise cardiovascular risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac deconditioning: Less habitual activity reduces cardiac stroke volume and aerobic capacity, so daily exertion becomes harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endothelial and vascular changes: Lack of movement promotes poorer endothelial function and favours atherogenic plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic effects: Inactivity increases the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance and adverse lipid changes — all major drivers of atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and autonomic imbalance: Sedentary behaviour links to low-grade inflammation and less favourable autonomic (heart rate variability) profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these pathways mean a progressive drop in MVPA both reflects and contributes to the biological processes that eventually cause heart attacks or strokes. For public guidance, major health bodies emphasise staying active because of these mechanistic links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MVPA declines over time reflect race and gender inequalities in &lt;keyword id="612120" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-health" source="Orion"&gt;heart health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARDIA authors also examined demographic patterns. While MVPA tended to decline across all groups with age, the trajectory and baseline levels differed by sex and race. Notably, the study found that Black women recorded consistently lower activity levels across adulthood, and certain groups showed more continuous declines — patterns that can concentrate cardiovascular risk in already disadvantaged populations. These findings imply prevention must be tailored: population-level recommendations are necessary but insufficient without culturally and structurally appropriate supports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think longitudinally, not just cross-sectionally. A single “low activity” datapoint is less informative than a trend; clinicians should ask about changes in routine and stamina over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use risk tools alongside functional history. Tools such as the ASCVD Risk Estimator help assess 10-year risk, but trend information about MVPA can flag patients who might benefit from earlier screening or intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Act early. Declining MVPA constitutes a window for action — lifestyle counselling, targeted exercise support, and if indicated, medical risk-factor treatment (BP, lipids, glycemia). The earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of preventing an event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to evaluate a patient’s steady decline in stamina&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient reports a steady, unexplained fall in activity or stamina, reasonable initial steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic cardiovascular screening: blood pressure, BMI/waist measure, lipid panel, fasting glucose/HbA1c. Calculate ASCVD or other validated risk scores (for patients in the appropriate age range) to guide intensity of preventive therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional assessment: a simple timed walk or effort-tolerance discussion can be very revealing; refer for formal stress testing only if clinical suspicion of ischemia is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider social drivers: ask about work, caregiving, safety, access to safe walking spaces and time pressures — these often explain activity declines and must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From prevention to recovery: Practical guidelines for safe and sustainable cardiovascular fitness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health and cardiology bodies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) as a baseline goal for adults; more gives additional benefit. Practical tips to meet and sustain MVPA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break activity into short, consistent bouts (eg. , 30 minutes, 5 days/week).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose enjoyable activities (walking, cycling, swimming, dance) to improve adherence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build movement into routines (active commuting, stairs, standing breaks at work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set trajectory goals rather than single-day targets (track weekly MVPA minutes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address barriers (childcare, unsafe neighbourhoods, pain) with tailored solutions or supervised programs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone does have a cardiovascular event, the evidence strongly supports early referral to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR combines monitored exercise, risk-factor management, nutrition and psychosocial support; it reduces mortality and improves functional recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical guidance: begin activity gently (short walks) in hospital recovery, progress under supervision to 30+ minutes of aerobic activity several times weekly, and incorporate supervised outpatient CR when available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to track activity trends (tools that help detect a worrying decline)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearables and phone apps: track MVPA minutes and weekly totals. Look for a sustained downward slope over months/years, not day-to-day noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple logs: a weekly activity diary or 6-minute walk distance recorded every few months provides a low-tech trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical prompts: clinicians should routinely ask, “Compared with two years ago, do you find doing your usual activities harder?” A “yes” can prompt further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/boost-liver-function-with-this-gut-friendly-no-bake-date-bar-supporting-overall-wellness-gastroenterologist-shares-easy-homemade-recipe/articleshow/123230892.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Boost liver function with this gut-friendly no-bake date bar supporting overall wellness; gastroenterologist shares easy homemade recipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AJBVV95cUxQb0ZvX3kwVjFVQ0d0V2RCaFVocWZ6SFFXRTJuUHRSazdPRlYwUVN4a1AxeE9hZkkwTEItaVFOWEQ2ZzF0LXRJd2NCN3ZaZWRXS2RMai1QSy1rRG9aZzF5YnB5RVNwT3IzM3hObnVQTVZmQ25kTzBiT24zTHE1TUYzVFF4bTh2TjBldjd5c2NnZUxubVRiMzQ4dEk0ZWdMeWsxWkxkdHNWR1VDWXYyMm1vSzBUVDlJZTV0RlB6WTFnT0ZuQUNfV3ZPZ2xhaUUwUHpYRDN6Smc2U0pXUWs0UTFmaVRoWFpTRjlwNjg3QnhsR0Nvb0V4RldLSzBZbDZmOXV1T2s4d3ZzbmRkRU9ERXRYRy01TkRwaGQ0ZExJYXZnQnVsR3F4YVNHM3dkWnF2dGJkbEJGSlRtaUowaGo0a0czeFZCLWRmTUVlQVVPeXl4cV8</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，炸薯条可能比你想象的更大健康风险-食品和葡萄酒</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOMnZtYlZkelJscFM4Ym43SEJHNjItWURWOS1yTjR2d0w2OVFRSndWZEQ0Q3FJblpSVlJkT3NKUEMzSGtpWE9zSDhHb0JucTROOHhhWS1UbHFzampaUEdYaFhGOXpVcDJYZWlsWk82YTV2Z29MQ2ZzQ2piamVxbFNtRFVXYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that eating french fries three times a week or more is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other preparations of potato did not yield the same degree of risk, indicating that it's the cooking method that's the primary culprit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutritional guidelines and a dietitian emphasize that potatoes can still provide valuable nutrition, including fiber, potassium, and vitamin C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you love them baked, mashed, roasted, grilled, or stuffed, potatoes are popular all across America — and the world. But if you love your spuds in fry form, you might want to pause before firing up the deep fryer or placing that next fast-food fry order, because researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health just uncovered some potential health implications from this popular dish. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new study, published this week in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj-2024-082121" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;The British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that eating french fries three times a week was associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to eating them less than once a week. This is a valuable insight considering that about 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/statistics/about-diabetes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Harvard team analyzed data from four decades of 205,107 adults in the United States who didn’t have diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer when the study began. The takeaway? The risk for developing type 2 diabetes wasn’t the potato’s fault on its own. Instead, it came down to how this humble ingredient was prepared, with deep-fried potatoes yielding the worst results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes are considered a vegetable and can be included in a healthy eating plan, according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) 2020–2025 &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Potatoes are a staple in many cultural diets across the globe and can absolutely be considered a ‘healthy’ addition to the diet,” says registered dietitian and certified personal trainer &lt;a href="http://www.shawsimpleswaps.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, MS, RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, an author and nutrition communications strategist. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes are naturally fat-free and sodium-free, in addition to containing fiber, protein, and other key vitamins and minerals. For reference, one medium &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/i/usda/potatoes-boiled-cooked-in-skin-flesh-without-salt-1-potato-2-0.5-dia-sphere/513fceb575b8dbbc21001671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;cooked potato&lt;/a&gt; with the skin on contains 118 calories, 0.1 grams of fat, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of dietary fiber, and 2.5 grams of protein. It also provides 515 milligrams of potassium and is a source of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/potatoes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-the-way-you-cook-potatoes-really-change-how-they-affect-your-body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can the way you cook potatoes really change how they affect your body? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to researchers, yes. This study found no significant diabetes risk associated with potato preparations such as baked, boiled, and mashed tubers or even potato chips. The only culprit? French fries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; French fries are typically deep-fried in oil, heavily salted, and in some cases made with added flours, sugars, or preservatives. Take &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/small-french-fries.html#accordion-c921f9207b-item-283bee7dbd" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;McDonald’s&lt;/a&gt; famous fries, for example. In addition to potatoes and vegetable oil, they include beef flavoring, dextrose (a simple sugar), sodium acid pyrophosphate (an additive), and salt. One large order packs in 480 calories, 23 grams of fat, and 400 milligrams of sodium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-the-most-nutritious-way-to-cook-a-potato"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is the most nutritious way to cook a potato? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To start, keeping the skin on potatoes for serving is an excellent choice because this is where you’ll find the most fiber. “Increasing dietary fiber has been linked to improved health outcomes, including better blood sugar control, weight management, and more,” explains Shaw.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She adds that the cooking method matters too, saying, “It’s best to consider the cooking method if they’re a daily part of your diet, opting for boiled, baked, air-fried, or roasted over deep-fried options.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what should a fry lover do? Shaw recommends making homemade fries and cooking them in an air fryer. “Slicing them into steak-size fries with a spritz of olive oil and salt yields that same restaurant-quality texture and taste without the fat and calories of a traditional french fry,” she notes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/mashed-potatoes-recipes-6406547" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mashed potato&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/baked-potato-7559551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt; fans can also make a few smart swaps if desired. Instead of opting for a pat of butter or using full-fat sour cream and cheese, try mixing in Greek yogurt or light sour cream for that same creamy taste with less saturated fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-is-too-much-potato"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How much is too much potato? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A medium potato, or about 5 ounces, is the standard serving size… Think about the size of a small fist,” advises Shaw. How often you enjoy potatoes will depend on your individual nutritional needs and health goals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Personally, I recommend variety in my clients' diets, encouraging them to alternate between russets, sweet, and red potatoes to get their potato fix in while providing their body with a variety of nutrients,” she suggests. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy potatoes daily, that’s okay too. “It really depends on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you’re enjoying them (like baked over fried) and alongside what other nutrient-dense foods.” Shaw recommends pairing potatoes with healthy fats and protein to help support balanced blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What it boils down to is that there’s no need to shun potatoes from your kitchen. Just pay attention to preparation methods, limiting deep-fried french fries and opting for air-fried, boiled, baked, roasted, or mashed potatoes when possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms include loud snoring and making gasping or choking noises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thirty people living with the disorder and aged between 19 and 65 were involved in the trial, led by researchers at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About half of the group were taught how to use the shell, while the others carried out deep breathing exercises. Both groups were encouraged to practise their techniques for at least 15 minutes, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Six months later, the trial found that those who had practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the day. They also had higher blood oxygen levels during the night, and four to five fewer OSA episodes an hour on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication,” said Dr Krishna K Sharma, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common form of treatment for sleep apnoea is a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machine, which involves patients wearing a mask that blows pressurised air into the nose and throat while asleep. Previous research has also found that playing a woodwind instrument could help with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the machines are effective, they can be uncomfortable, leading the researchers to suggest that shankh blowing could be a promising alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A larger trial involving several hospitals is being planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The findings of this trial are encouraging, but the small scale of the trial means it’s too soon to say for certain that conch blowing can help people manage their obstructive sleep apnoea,” said Dr Erika Kennington, the head of research and innovation at Asthma + Lung UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s also not clear from this research why blowing through a conch shell regularly might improve someone’s symptoms. It would be good to see the conch blowing approach tested on a larger scale and compared with other proven strategies, such as limiting alcohol, staying active and maintaining good bedtime habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“OSA is a long-term condition, but with the right treatments and lifestyle changes, people can make a real difference to their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZER1T0txSEJvZXV2cWU3TWJ1SDdOMVNXMlNsTXN3TUlRalVaUy05SkJUYmxNS0VhZWJOMzFUQkM4YkJjWkVzR0RINUgwZkhqNnpqS2tJZXByWUEzQ1M1aDFGd0xYUjRMZ2RXVmhaY2xFMnpGMmhsUEtLQjhFUTg2Q3NzS19ncGVTUmNxOExHbnYxajBucXRVZFpvWGlqWHJ0MXZxLXBKOTJxTjU5anhUWHVhaw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，心脏病可以在胆固醇或血压升高警报之前十年开始：如何识别-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwJBVV95cUxNYlh4MUlaNWlrMThoaTRvd0hZWEIyQjJ1allkTGlVekJVR2cwbU9JbVFucHdwWFNiMTlPV0FIeXJVLW15QWtod1hVaGIyclVfOXFHbjRNSUJmWlRRQ25aYVpaODdDWWxOYjA4WUhoamRXaWJWQVkwMDlQOVJSbjFNWU4zRDBUUW9ZcHFzMUppWDUtTTRoZERoZEpxTDNrYmVfTVBZS1BDdlQ1U01mNXVOT3FWWXlNelNMNW5VMlExNk5DYU9MNVlkeUp0ZDVuc293enVwNG5CUENuUU4tMkx1OGxOMEpIRXBnc2F4bHdZclY5cDJwZHIzb2hIOUxTT2hCMU0wVHNtS2RXRUV6emFrQVVBQzhYV25XZXAyMzduMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're cruising through your 20s and 30s, enjoying life, maybe hitting the gym or walking the dog. Then, without a dramatic event, your energy starts to dip. You move less, sleep more, skip workouts more often—not because you’re lazy, but because life gets busy, health shifts, or routines change. This downward trend isn’t just a sign of ageing—it might be an early whisper from your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836452" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;in JAMA Cardiology has surfaced this subtle red flag: people who later developed heart-related conditions, like heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure, actually showed a dip in their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) around 12 years before their diagnosis. That’s more than a decade of downshifting before things got serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what they found: across more than 3,000 adults tracked from their mid-20s into late middle-age, physical activity naturally tapered off over time. That’s kinda expected but those who eventually ended up with cardiovascular disease (CVD) experienced a sharper, earlier drop in activity, especially about two years before the actual diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause on that: this decline started way before any red flags in your cholesterol or blood pressure, before you knew something was off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like the heart sending a whisper, not a shout. And that gives us a huge window to act, to course-correct—and maybe even stop things from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to the story. The study also unpacked how this trend varies across different groups. That’s a big red flag pointing at inequities in opportunity, support, access, things like safe places to exercise, affordable options, flexible schedules—all the real-world stuff that shouldn’t be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease is still the big boss of health problems in the US, and not in a good way&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart diseases are the leading cause of death for both men and women, claiming about 1 in 5 lives each year. Millions of Americans are walking around with risk factors, some they know about, some they don’t. High blood pressure? That’s more than 120 million adults. High cholesterol? Over 90 million. And then there’s diabetes, obesity, smoking, stress, and sitting way too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s sneaky is how common it all is. You can be in your 40s, feeling “fine,” and still have silent plaque building in your arteries. Lifestyle plays a massive role, processed food, too much salt and sugar, and not enough daily movement are basically an open invitation to heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? Most of these risks can be lowered. Eat better, move more, keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in check, and quit smoking if you do. The heart might be complicated, but it also responds fast to healthier choices. In other words, you’ve got more control over your heart health than you might think—so start taking care of it now, not when the first scare hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the takeaway? Let’s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Physical activity as a canary in the coal mine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your movement starts tapering, especially consistently and long term, it might not be just busy life. It could be an early signal of strain on your cardiovascular system. And studying that decline gives us a huge head start to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep moving, always&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for a crisis. Starting good movement habits early isn't just about losing weight or staying fit, it’s about keeping your heart talking to you softly, not screaming when it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tailored support matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that not everyone has the same chances to stay active means we need targeted help, especially for those groups hit hardest: think community-friendly parks, local affordable classes, supportive healthcare advice that’s tailored, not generic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recovery isn’t optional&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once someone is diagnosed, getting back to movement, even slowly, is critical. Post-heart-event life doesn’t mean sitting on the couch indefinitely. Unfortunately, the study found most people stayed below recommended activity levels even after a diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of this like screening, not just with blood tests, but with lifestyle checks. If doctors, communities, and people start paying attention to when your activity starts to drop, that could become a real, actionable early warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the heart has a way of speaking quietly before it shouts. That gradual slowdown in your daily energy or activity? It might be worth listening to. Let’s keep our bodies moving, not just for now, but for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwJBVV95cUxNYlh4MUlaNWlrMThoaTRvd0hZWEIyQjJ1allkTGlVekJVR2cwbU9JbVFucHdwWFNiMTlPV0FIeXJVLW15QWtod1hVaGIyclVfOXFHbjRNSUJmWlRRQ25aYVpaODdDWWxOYjA4WUhoamRXaWJWQVkwMDlQOVJSbjFNWU4zRDBUUW9ZcHFzMUppWDUtTTRoZERoZEpxTDNrYmVfTVBZS1BDdlQ1U01mNXVOT3FWWXlNelNMNW5VMlExNk5DYU9MNVlkeUp0ZDVuc293enVwNG5CUENuUU4tMkx1OGxOMEpIRXBnc2F4bHdZclY5cDJwZHIzb2hIOUxTT2hCMU0wVHNtS2RXRUV6emFrQVVBQzhYV25XZXAyMzduMA</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：男性和女性症状和风险因素的差异-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPbXVSa05PTENwaGxEOU9UUTd1YmFROWEtcGVlbU1NS0tHSXBxWl9BUjNFc21vTWRKTkFjeDVWeWRwX1RVNHhtLWQyTnZnYjJiZ18ta2NmUER5S054YUhQenMxYzBNelctb2VfZHdUdzBtQzNHMjg2UzBBX3hBeUROaWVrYXF2S0FYQUNhWFBWVy1WaEhaXzRsa0VSaXVsSGJWeG9tVVNabGY5VTNicFo3ZEN0dnhqc3ZJa3NBdWFZN1NMQVJsZzhUZm9ZSDVxMldaOV9iV3lCTmpYTGVXaVo3c1VTenh0bG92S1Z0bVY0SGo4cy02RTNQMy1n0gH_AUFVX3lxTFB5RjlsRHRXR2JqQmFiYjVEcVdJRk9rUHFPUGpmZ2tadkt2TE9leUlSR2NBbjEyemlFN0pWV0QwTWE0UXE5dUQzVHVNZmxyRzUwTlVFdnNVaEVTM2lFLTFYTnRjT2FyaE1UajZ5Q2VpOW04UmM1dFprQWpJU0haNGhhdnA3YkxwRDZqQ2RMQ19DOWdwQkxPTklLRzhWVk9RZ19YN18yR0lqU0hZSXplM3RxMFlYM0M2MVVROGhodTIyQjNFejc3aWxJZmZFdWJxc1l1MXc3bmlVVDVIRVZfU0RqcFNrWVBUSUJ2bkl1ZzkyOEQtLWtZb0FxbUZHWlQ3MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is one of the most common types of cancer in both men and women around the world. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults. In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although colon cancer affects both men and women, it’s not the same for everyone. While symptoms like changes in bowel habits or blood in the stool are shared, the risk factors, tumor location, and outcomes can differ by sex. Men face higher rates overall and higher death rates, while women more often develop cancer in parts of the colon that are harder to spot early. Hormones like estrogen, body weight, lifestyle habits, and genetic differences all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is colon cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, when it includes the rectum, develops in the cells lining the large intestine. It usually begins as benign polyps, which can turn cancerous over time.

Estrogen supports beneficial gut bacteria, while testosterone may promote harmful ones. These interactions may contribute to sex-specific differences in cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle risk factors: The markers that matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors affect men and women differently.

Screening recommendations have shifted: organizations now advise starting regular checks at age 45 instead of 50, leading to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/early-diagnosis-surge-for-CRC" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 62% increase in screening among 45-49 year-olds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; from 2019 to 2023. Poor diets, obesity, alcohol, and low calcium were key risk factors in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, younger women under 50 face &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;an 82% higher incidence rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared to men in the same age group. Late diagnoses are common in this group due to assumptions that young people are low-risk. Reports also link the rise among younger populations to obesity, Western diets, sedentary habits, alcohol, and fatty liver, but men appear more affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening and prevention: One size doesn’t fit all&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early screening and why it helps: Detecting colon cancer early saves lives. In the United States of America, guidelines have been updated; recommendations now start at age 45 instead of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering women's tendency toward right-sided tumors and later onset and men's stronger lifestyle risk factors, experts suggest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12094-024-03801-0" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;tailoring screening and prevention by sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While colon cancer shows similar symptoms in men and women, differences in incidence, tumor location, biology, lifestyle influences, and outcomes reveal a complex picture. Men generally face higher risk and death rates, while women, especially older ones, often develop more aggressive right-sided tumors that are harder to catch early. Hormonal factors, gut microbiome interactions, and lifestyle habits shape these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fight colon cancer most effectively, we need both shared and sex-aware approaches like encouraging healthy diets, regular exercise, limiting alcohol and smoking, and promoting early screening starting in mid-forties.

			&lt;p&gt;Humans may be &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy"&gt;living longer on average&lt;/a&gt; these days, but, even so, only a fraction of us will live to see our 100th birthday. Yet the reasons why only a select few will become centenarians still remains a mystery to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest work published by myself and my colleagues has just uncovered one factor that may be key to the long lives that centenarians experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research team has found that people that live to 100 seem to possess the superhuman ability to avoid disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;Want to Live Past 100? Experts Recommend These Four Habits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians are of such great interest to scientists because they may hold the key to understanding how we can live longer – and live longer in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some questions researchers have long pondered is whether one of the keys to a centenarian's resilience mainly lies in their ability to postpone major diseases, or whether they're simply better at surviving them. Or, could it be that they avoid certain diseases altogether?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the answer to these questions would bring us at least one step closer to figuring out what specific factors contribute to longevity. So my colleagues and I set out to see if we could find the answers. In two recent studies, we analysed and compared long and shorter-lived people born in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the two studies showed that centenarians not only suffer from fewer diseases overall throughout their lives, they also develop them more slowly. They're also less likely to experience deadly conditions, such as major cardiovascular disease, compared to their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01330-w"&gt;The first study&lt;/a&gt; included 170,787 people born in Stockholm County, Sweden between 1912 and 1922. Using historical health data, residents were followed for 40 years – either from age 60 until their death, or up to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculated each participant's risks of stroke, heart attack, hip fracture and various cancers, and compared those who survived to the age of 100 with their shorter-lived counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that centenarians not only had lower rates of disease in late-midlife, but they continued to have lower rates of disease throughout their life overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the age of 85, only 4% of those who lived to be centenarians had experienced a stroke. In comparison, around 10% of those who almost became centenarians – living to ages 90–99 – had experienced a stroke by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, despite living longer, their lifetime risk for most diseases never reached those of their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 100, 12.5% of centenarians had experienced a heart attack, compared to just over 24% among people who lived between the ages of 80 and 89. This suggests that centenarians delay – and in many cases even avoid – major age-related diseases, rather than simply surviving them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study is that it only focused on analysing more serious diagnoses of major diseases. But what if the real key to longevity isn't that centenarians avoid disease entirely – rather, it's that they're able to avoid developing serious diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, we conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00328-1/fulltext"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; that included 40 different medical conditions. These conditions ranged from mild to severe – such as hypertension, heart failure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at 274,108 participants who were born between 1920 and 1922 and who lived in Sweden. We followed participants for around 30 years – either from the age of 70 until their death or until they turned 100. A total of 4,330 people became centenarians – just 1.5% of the participants we looked at for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg" alt="doctor listening to man's heart" class="wp-image-170828 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Centenarians were less likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;Gabriella Csapo/corelens/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after including a wider range of diseases and allowing participants to have more than one health condition in the analysis, our team came to the same conclusions as we did in the first study: centenarians developed fewer diseases – and their rate of disease accumulation was slower across their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that centenarians were more likely to have conditions limited to a single organ system. This is a sign of this group's health and resilience, since diseases that affect one organ system are much easier to treat and manage in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, while cardiovascular conditions were the most common diagnoses across all age groups, centenarians were less likely overall to be diagnosed compared to their short-lived companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 80, around 8% of centenarians were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. In comparison, more than 15% of people who died at the age of 85 had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease by 80 years of age. The lower rates of cardiovascular disease appear to be central to the centenarians' extended survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians also demonstrated greater resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions – such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and dementia – throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg" alt="Centenarian with flowers" class="wp-image-170829 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions could be a secret to a longer life. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;EyeJoy/Getty Signature Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most centenarians eventually developed multiple health conditions, they did so much later in life than non-centenarians – usually around the age of 89. This was thanks to having fewer diseases and a slower rate of disease accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, non-centenarians typically experienced a sharp increase in the number of health conditions they suffered with in the final years of their lives. But centenarians did not experience this same sharp decline in health – even from their 90s onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The secret to a long life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that centenarians manage to delay, and in some cases avoid, disease despite living longer is both intriguing and encouraging. It shows it's possible to age more slowly than is typical – and challenges the common belief that a longer life inevitably comes with more disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that exceptional longevity isn't just about postponing illness but reflects a distinct pattern of ageing. But whether this is mainly due to genetics, lifestyle, environment or a combination of these factors remains unknown. The next step in our research will be to explore what factors predict living to 100 – and how such predictors operate during a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms behind healthy ageing in centenarians may offer valuable insights for promoting longer, healthier lives for all.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262645/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a small trial undertaken by a specialist team of researchers in India , 30 people aged between 19 and 65 with OSA were encouraged to blow into a conch shell for a mimimum of 15 minutes, five days a week, with remarkable results uncovered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also reported an average four or five less apnoeas, where breathing is paused during sleep at night, per hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharma described shankh blowing as a 'distinctive' exercise that 'involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining how the decades-old method works, Dr Sharma added: 'This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The shankh’s unique spiralling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medical expert explained that the technique is simple, low-cost and will help provide a snoring remedy that moves away from medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the success of the initial study, the team of researchers are now planning a larger trial that is set to involve several hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hope, Dr Sharma adds, is that it will help the team 'assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods', alongside determine whether it can help assist those with the 'most severe forms of OSA'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The innovative new study comes as amid shocking new research that suggested those suffering with OSA could trigger lung cancer, with a 'significant' link uncovered between the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who blew into the shell for six months were found to be 34 per cent less sleepy during the day and also had better quality of sleep than those who practised deep breathing exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jowan Al-Nusair, study co-author and physician at Marshall University told the Daily Mail it was 'one of the first statistically significant studies' to prove a link between the condition and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While further studies are definitely now needed to investigate just how the significant the link truly is, this suggests OSA may be a preventable risk factor for lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We should be more closely monitoring patients with OSA. Patients would definitely benefit from screening and early intervention to combat OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additional studies are essential to understand exactly why OSA may increase this risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaHlJRFZ3VjZWNTJYZGpJNERQZmpzcWc2eExxN3Q2dzI3V253N0FGVlZtU05ZZ0gzS2hROU1NeVVOQW1nNmdJcldUNXgtTHJqeTA1M3VoSnpob2pRYWJVeWIwT0szR0VCZUpOaWRqeW5QeDVxQWJlUzMzQjFlTmpXb3Q2b1lKbWpZOVkwTEpndlVUd2FfdjJ3TEFqVl83SkFrY1hkOVZoSjLSAa4BQVVfeXFMT3VQX1JidDJrOFFnOUZ1NE1WanBsZWZQa2ZYM0xqSWtTck83TDJ1VUNpYnFsc1B6WDdwYTMtY2J5amNGdFpiamNoMkRvMFd3NzRwbHFSeEc4WUFyaFItakJTMklqZzRNcF9ZUV9NVVRuWElYOGJXZGpFYnpkLThnOGp6bEU3c2ZjT1JCN2xMS2JUblBPR0J5TXczMW40X2ZUSk1DTDZoOVdhUlhETFFn</guid></item><item><title>花生灵丹妙药：每天只吃少量零食可以减缓衰老-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNWmVwaFVEM3hHTHV1QngtaHY3LVZreWM2Q2l6LWMzUG90cTNuSHp2LXh3ejc2dHhPNXhFN01MVmRyWl9XUEEyRFJXVmNkZWJsWXhqT3BXZG5sc0hlVkw5SUx4Z3V0SXR4MDhCME8zR2FtajV5RmZpdG9UcjhleXFnUjlwakxMbGtuNklzSm4zdDFxVndZZFA2cWl5TDlQbkHSAaQBQVVfeXFMUGEtUUJwRk5BMWloRm51WFdjOWhzNmNsaFlEMnRrV21JTXhEaGgxczdMbHJLMElJb3BvQTlwTGZ6OXNybjlHckd5ZWp6SWxPeTVZVkVWV0tKNnctSWZ4cUZrVE9iX3FzUHNuejd1SEE1eS1RclBZbDViXy03V2k5NWp3S0x1QjFJSVdTNUJIQTY0VHBEOTFVN3BOdUw2RG5iaE5GelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who practiced blowing through a conch shell regularly for six months experienced a reduction in their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), according to a small randomized controlled trial published in &lt;i&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;OSA is a common sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during the night due to a blocked airway. It leads to loud snoring, restless sleep and daytime sleepiness. It also increases the risk of high blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowing the conch shell, or shankh blowing, has been part of Indian culture for thousands of years. The new research showed that people with moderate OSA who practiced shankh blowing slept better, felt more alert during the day and had fewer breathing interruptions at night. The researchers say conch blowing is a simple, low-cost intervention that could help reduce symptoms without the need for medication or machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Dr. Krishna K Sharma from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India. He said, "The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/standard+treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;standard treatment&lt;/a&gt; for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which keeps the patient's airway open by blowing air through a facemask throughout the night. While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In my &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+practice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical practice&lt;/a&gt;, several patients reported feeling more rested and experiencing fewer symptoms after regularly practicing shankh blowing—a traditional yogic breathing exercise involving exhaling through a conch shell. These observations led us to design a scientific study to rigorously test whether this simple, ancient practice could serve as a meaningful therapy for people with OSA."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study included 30 people with moderate OSA, aged between 19 and 65, who were assessed at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute between May 2022 and January 2024. They were tested with polysomnography, meaning they are monitored throughout a night's sleep, and asked questions about the quality of their sleep and how sleepy they feel during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were randomly assigned to either be trained to practice blowing through a conch shell (16 patients) or to practice a deep breathing exercise (14 patients). Participants were provided with a traditional shankh used in yogic practices. They were trained in person at the clinic by a study team member before beginning home-based practice. Participants were encouraged to practice at home for a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week. After six months, the patients were reassessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the people who practiced deep breathing, the people who practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the daytime. They reported sleeping better and polysomnography revealed that they had four to five fewer apneas (where breathing stops during sleep) per hour on average. They also had higher levels of oxygen in their blood during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharma said, "The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/soft+palate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;soft palate&lt;/a&gt;—areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA. The shankh's unique spiraling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"For people living with OSA, especially those who find CPAP uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, our findings offer a promising alternative. Shankh blowing is a simple, low-cost breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a small study, but we are now planning a larger trial involving several hospitals. This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels and sleep in greater detail. We're particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sophia Schiza, Head of the ERS group on sleep-disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, who was not involved in the research, said, "Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disease around the world. We know that OSA patients have poor quality of sleep, and higher risks of high blood pressure, strokes and heart disease. A proportion of patients experience sleepiness during the day. While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still need for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscle training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2022 found a tenuous but plausible link between picking your nose and an increased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where picking at your nose causes internal tissue damage, critical species of bacteria have a clearer path to the brain, which responds to their presence in ways that resemble signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous caveats here, not the least of which is that the supporting research so far is in mice rather than humans, but the findings are definitely worth further investigation – and could improve our understanding of how Alzheimer's disease starts, which remains something of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;Alzheimer's Breakthrough: Lithium Reverses Memory Loss in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by scientists from Griffith University in Australia ran tests with a bacterium called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_pneumoniae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can infect humans and cause  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria has &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004300050071"&gt;also been discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the majority of human brains affected by late-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was demonstrated that in mice, the bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve (joining the nasal cavity and the brain). What's more, when there was damage to the nasal epithelium (the thin tissue along the roof of the nasal cavity), nerve infections got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the mouse brains depositing more of the amyloid-beta protein – a protein which is released in response to infections. Plaques (or clumps) of this protein are also found in significant concentrations in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-how-alzheimer-s-causes-cells-to-overheat-and-fry-like-eggs"&gt;people with Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg" alt="Mouse Study Suggests Surprising Link Between Alzheimer's And Nose-Picking" class="wp-image-148468 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid-beta protein plaques, in orange.

It's thought that bacteria and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; see the nose as a quick route to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not certain that the effects will be the same in humans, or even that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-a-new-theory-about-what-causes-alzheimers-and-its-not-plaque"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques are a cause of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's nevertheless important to follow up promising leads in the fight to understand this common neurodegenerative condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to do this study in humans and confirm whether the same pathway operates in the same way," &lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2022/10/28/new-research-suggests-nose-picking-could-increase-risk-for-alzheimers-and-dementia/"&gt;said St John&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's research that has been proposed by many people, but not yet completed. What we do know is that these same bacteria are present in humans, but we haven't worked out how they get there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nose picking isn't exactly a rare thing. In fact, it's possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/nose-picking"&gt;as many as 9 out of 10 people&lt;/a&gt; do it… not to mention a bunch of other species (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-caught-aye-aye-using-its-wacky-long-finger-for-something-pretty-gnarly"&gt;some a little more adept&lt;/a&gt; than others). While the benefits aren't clear, studies like this one should give us pause before picking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg" alt="child picking their nose" class="wp-image-148469 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nose picking: not just a habit for small children.

More muscle guaranteed, side order of grunting certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’m not new to resistance training in my kitchen. Last year I shared with readers a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/30-minute-kitchen-workout-advice-antonia-hoyle-9twg2j9ls" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;workout I had devised&lt;/a&gt;, finding it more practical than driving to a mansplaining gym. Drawing&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; inspiration from exercise classes I’d attended and personal trainers I’d interviewed as a health journalist, my routine focused on lots of repetitions of lighter weights, which improved my muscle endurance and cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This workout helped me to feel fitter at 45 than I have felt in my life. But I was also beginning to plateau. There were only so many times I could tweak my existing exercises or increase my reps to challenge myself. Like many women I know who have exercised for a long time, I needed a new approach. I needed to join the heavy weights gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The benefits of heavier weight training go far beyond stopping the loss of muscle that accelerates in midlife, which most of us are now aware of. It can also help to regulate blood sugar levels and increase bone mineral density, which typically declines with oestrogen levels in menopause. Lifting heavier weights is likely to be better for fat loss than lifting light weights because it helps you to build more muscle — and because muscle tissue burns more energy than fat, even at rest, the more we have, the less susceptible we are to midlife spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It has also been found to be particularly good for the brain. Research in 2023 found that lifting weights at 80 per cent of participants’ 1RM (one rep max — the maximum weight you can lift) increased levels of the protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) whereas lifting weights at 60 per cent did not. BDNF aids neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/strength-training-midlife-weight-workout-exercises-zd6vmqx09" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to start weight training in midlife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Los Angeles writer Casey Johnston’s new book, &lt;i&gt;A Physical Education&lt;/i&gt;, charts how powerlifting helped her to overcome years of unhealthy dieting and exercising. Although Johnson, 38, appeared to be super-fit — she ran half-marathons and did cardio several times a week — she argues that instead of focusing on getting a stronger body, her fitness routines were all based on burning calories “to help reveal her muscles underneath”. She was always exhausted and preoccupied with what her body looked like, trying to tone rather than get strong. “I was running more and more and eating less and less,” she has said — and was unaware that she was actually losing muscle in the process. Changing her workout to focus on lifting heavy weights transformed that. It was not about getting “smaller” but about “how you feel. It’s about protecting yourself,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On Instagram the personal trainer Elizabeth Davies, 41, aka &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thiswomanlifts/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;@thiswomanlifts&lt;/a&gt;, describes “toning” as “a made-up term arguably designed to prey on women who have been conditioned for decades to fear getting bigger”. She adds: “We cannot tone a muscle. We cannot sculpt a muscle. We cannot blast fat around a muscle by exercising that muscle.” Muscle either increases in size, remains the same size or shrinks, she explains, and muscle is crucial for health, not aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ve become inspired by the American influencer Alicia Erickson, the Midlife Maven, who is a lifelong fitness fanatic like me but until recently of entirely average build. By 45 her regular running and CrossFit regime had started to feel taxing on her body. At 49 she started weight training instead and now boasts biceps of steel and abs you could crack a walnut on, with the emphasis very much on heavy weights. “Booties” are not built with light dumbbells, she recently said, her confidence exuding from every pore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.9"&gt;&lt;div id="c7df2301-3df3-404a-a477-72f4de4d5495"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;“I have more energy but most importantly I feel stronger, more resilient”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ANDREW FOX FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The fitness trainer Jack Hanrahan has noticed a rise in women swapping multiple sets of lighter dumbbells for heavy weightlifting. “Once you’ve mastered your form with lighter weights, going heavier is the sensible thing to do,” he says. “You’re not going to become stronger if you’re not challenging your muscles.” And, he adds, “heavy lifting changes the way my clients carry themselves. When you feel really strong, you feel more capable. It gives you more courage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Before I switched up my routine I wanted to know if it was safe to lift heavier weights in my kitchen, still not having the time or inclination to queue for complicated equipment in a weights room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-be-healthy-strong-fit-happy-at-50-c5gqkkn53" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet your new midlife fitness guru: how to have a better body over 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Absolutely,” says the personal trainer Kate Rowe-Ham, who teaches midlife women to do just that via online classes on her app, Owning Your Menopause. “For some women it’s less intimidating lifting heavy weights at home than a gym because there’s no one to see you pull a funny face.” On Rowe-Ham’s recommendation I bought heavier dumbbells — 10kg (£56), 12.5kg (£68) and 15kg (£80) — from Factory Weights. An investment, obviously, but still cheaper than a gym membership. I also use a 6kg medicine ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;According to Hanrahan, some people worry that going heavier means a mandatory gym membership to avoid injury. But he says that if you are lifting slowly and carefully, you should be OK to do a heavy home workout. “You can handle heavier weights if you’re doing fewer reps because you’re under tension for less time,” he says. “If you can do the number of reps without failing, you’re strong enough. There’s no risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What is important is correct form, he stresses. Swaying or swinging during a movement increases the risk of injury, as does pushing to the point of failure “because your form degrades and that means you’re probably transferring some force into the joints”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Breathing correctly is also key. When muscles are “being lengthened and loaded and you need stability” — straightening your arm for a biceps curl or lowering for a squat, for example — breathe in through your nose because “it has a better connection to the diaphragm”, Hanrahan explains. “You’re more likely to breathe deeper, which activates the core muscles and stabilises the spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are 20 exercises in my new workout — 13 with heavier weights, along with seven conditioning exercises: jump squats, stomach crunches, oblique taps, lower abdominal raises, press-ups, triceps dips and a plank and side-plank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/strength-exercises-middle-age-midlife-2xc0g6mpf" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 easy exercises to keep you strong in midlife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I can still do it in my small kitchen. Lifting heavier I do fewer repetitions of most exercises. For example, I do three sets of ten shoulder presses rather than 50 in one go. I still do “pulses” — smaller movements while in, say, a squat — to increase the time my muscles spend under tension. I allow five slow breaths, or about 30 seconds, between each set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ve also added deadlifts to place more emphasis on my glutes, hamstrings and lower back, as well as weighted hip thrusts, which also work these muscle groups. “We spend so long sitting down with these muscles inactive that it’s important to train our posterior chain,” Rowe-Ham says. I have added bent-over lateral rows to build my upper back muscles, triceps kickbacks for the backs of my arms and weighted core exercises. For my squats I have added 3.5kg weights I found in the garage to my 20kg barbell, meaning I’m squatting 23.5kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Significantly I have sacrificed a spinning session to lift weights every other day (I used to do it every three days), setting my alarm for 5.30am. That’s painful but by the end of my session my heart pounds and I’m elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What I have really noticed is how I seem to burn through food now. I mostly eat healthily but I eat a lot, and a chocolate or chips blowout doesn’t seem to have an impact on the scales. I now weigh 6lb less than last summer and look a lot more muscly (according to my 14-year-old daughter). I have more energy but most importantly I feel stronger, more resilient. Cramming my weights back under the shoe rack at the end of a workout I feel as if I can take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;The heavy weight exercises that have transformed my fitness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Barbell squats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three sets of 40 reps with a 23.5kg weight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use weights that allow you to lift the barbell comfortably over your head and rest it on the fleshiest part of your trapezius (upper back muscles). Hold the bar with both hands so your elbows are in line with your torso. With your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing out, buttocks pushed back and back straight, lower as far as you can while keeping your back straight. Push up.

The paper was published in &lt;a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1536"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a broad term for a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. It is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease, but other types include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Dementia is progressive, meaning symptoms worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early signs can include forgetfulness, difficulty finding words, and trouble with problem-solving or planning. As the condition advances, individuals may struggle to recognize familiar people, perform routine tasks, or regulate emotions. Although aging is the greatest risk factor, dementia is not a normal part of aging. Genetics, cardiovascular health, head injuries, and lifestyle factors also contribute to risk. Research suggests that maintaining physical activity, cognitive engagement, and a healthy diet may help reduce the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Christina S. Dintica and colleagues sought to investigate whether dementia incidence varies across U.S. regions. They focused on older veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included 1,268,599 veterans aged 65 years or older who received care at VHA medical centers between October 1999 and September 2021. This group represented a randomly selected sample of about 5% of older veterans who used VHA services during those years. The average age was 73.9 years, and 2% were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be included, participants had to have known zip code information so that researchers could determine their geographic location. Those without a zip code were excluded. Dementia diagnoses were identified using medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their zip codes, participants were classified into one of 10 U.S. regions, each composed of 4 to 7 states: Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi); Southwest (Arizona, California, Hawai‘i, and Nevada); South Atlantic (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida); South (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas); Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming); Northwest (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington); Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York); Midwest (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska); Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and New Jersey); and Great Lakes (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest dementia incidence was observed in the Mid-Atlantic (11.2 per 1,000 person-years) and the highest in the Southeast (14.0 per 1,000 person-years). Compared with the Mid-Atlantic, dementia risk was 25% higher in the Southeast, 23% higher in both the Northwest and Rocky Mountains, 18% higher in the South, and 12% higher in the Midwest and South Atlantic. In the remaining regions, rates were less than 10% higher than in the Mid-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among older adults in the VHA, dementia incidence varied significantly across US regions, independent of key covariates. These findings highlight the need for targeted health care planning, public health interventions, and policy development,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the regional variation in dementia incidence rates. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results. While the study reported differences between geographical regions, the specific factors underlying these regional variations remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1536"&gt;Regional Differences in Dementia Incidence Among US Veterans,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Christina S.

ADHD-screened participants reported more frequent music use during both less demanding tasks and while studying, with a stronger preference for stimulating tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypical individuals tended toward relaxing, familiar music during cognitively heavy activities. Despite different preferences, both groups perceived similar boosts to concentration and mood from background music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Use in ADHD:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-screened participants used background music more often while studying and during sports than neurotypical peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Music Preference:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-screened listeners favored upbeat, stimulating music across both cognitive and non-cognitive tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Both groups reported similar perceived improvements in focus and emotional well-being from music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Highlights how music can be a low-cost, customizable tool for supporting focus and mood in both neurotypical and ADHD individuals, offering potential as an accessible cognitive aid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How This Aligns with Previous Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports theories like the Moderate Brain Arousal model and Mood Arousal Theory, reinforcing evidence that stimulation needs differ between ADHD and neurotypical populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Could inform the creation of personalized “cognitive playlists” and targeted music-based interventions to enhance learning, work performance, and emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a soundtrack to our lives—it’s a cognitive companion, an emotional regulator, and, for many, a daily necessity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study comparing young adults with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) offers a deeper look into how background music is used during daily tasks, and why preferences may differ between these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal that while both neurotypical and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;-screened individuals value music’s role in focus and mood, the situations in which they use it—and the kind of music they choose—can diverge in intriguing ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed 434 adults aged 17 to 30, dividing them into two groups: those who screened positive for ADHD and those without attentional symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their weekly listening time, the types of activities they paired with background music, and their preferences for music style and characteristics. They also rated music’s perceived effects on their concentration and emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities were split into “more cognitive” (such as studying, reading, problem-solving) and “less cognitive” (like cleaning, cooking, or exercising).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ADHD-screened participants reported more frequent background music use during certain situations—especially while studying and exercising—and in less cognitively demanding activities overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also had a stronger preference for stimulating music, regardless of the activity type. In contrast, neurotypical participants leaned more toward relaxing and familiar music during tasks requiring high concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite these differences in usage patterns, both groups rated music’s benefits to concentration and mood similarly, suggesting a shared appreciation for its cognitive and emotional lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These listening patterns fit neatly with two established psychological frameworks. The Cognitive Capacity Hypothesis proposes that our attentional resources are finite; complex tasks demand more of this “mental bandwidth,” leaving less capacity to process music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals with ADHD, whose attentional control may already be more limited, music could serve as either a helpful arousal booster or a distracting extra load, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Moderate Brain Arousal model offers another layer: people with ADHD may seek higher stimulation to reach optimal alertness, especially during repetitive or monotonous activities. Stimulating music, then, could be a deliberate strategy to keep focus steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the role of emotional regulation. According to the Mood Arousal Theory, music can modulate both emotional valence (pleasantness) and arousal level, influencing performance in a task-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypical participants’ preference for relaxing, familiar tracks during challenging activities may reflect a strategy to maintain calm focus, while ADHD-screened listeners’ attraction to stimulating, sometimes less familiar tracks could help counteract low arousal and wandering attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings add valuable nuance to our understanding of music and attention, they also come with caveats. This was a self-report study rather than a controlled experiment, and ADHD status was determined via a screening questionnaire, not a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, by capturing real-world listening habits rather than laboratory simulations, the research paints a realistic picture of how young adults integrate music into their daily cognitive routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is not a universal prescription—there’s no one “right” playlist for focus—but rather an invitation to think strategically about music use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with ADHD, stimulating, upbeat tracks might aid in sustaining attention for certain tasks, while neurotypical listeners may benefit from calming, instrumental choices during demanding work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies using brain imaging and controlled experiments could help clarify exactly how these choices affect neural activity, and whether personalized “cognitive playlists” could become a practical tool for enhancing focus and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the study makes one thing clear, it’s this: music isn’t just background noise—it’s an active ingredient in how we manage our minds.

However, a limited number of studies have specifically examined the patterns of background music usage during various more or less cognitive activities, especially among individuals with attentional difficulties related to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study primarily aimed to compare music listening habits during daily activities that are more and less cognitive (e.g., studying, problem-solving versus cleaning, engaging in sports) between neurotypical young adults and those screened for ADHD (respondents who were identified as likely having ADHD based on the number of self-reported symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, 434 young adults aged 17 to 30 responded to an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that certain listening habits differ significantly between the neurotypical and ADHD-screened groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADHD-screened group reports significantly more background music listening during less cognitive activities and while studying, compared to the neurotypical group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also reveal a difference in the proportion of individuals preferring stimulating music between the groups: ADHD-screened individuals report significantly more frequent listening to stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (more or less cognitive). Other aspects of music listening are common to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the group, more respondents reported preferring to listen to relaxing, instrumental, familiar and self-chosen music during more cognitive activities, whereas for less cognitive activities, more individuals mentioned preferring to listen to music that is stimulating, with lyrics, familiar and self-chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results confirm that most young adults listen to music during their daily activities and perceive positive effects from this listening.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 18:13:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFA0RERWLUxNTWkxbjNZSGxRcTVNamQyUktGUFU0TzRZMlFoSFRmSExZc1pVQ2Fpajd0YXdiejdXeDVpc2JiYWdlNXI4OHc2RVFoVjFnVnRaZ3V5eUtNZEJiYy1iTHpiNnQxVUVFSm1yNA</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年8月10日-每日科斯</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQS0QydXpEa2s1MTdpUnAzR25ocTZ4MWZvNXhWQmU4TDhjQlByUHN6cS1pU29LdUc3WThtSlVkQ2tvekhvVVAyS2dFUW9rbU5nUTI3eWpLc1h3U1o0MWEyR3BhVldkZE00dnVzM1pmUXVlc2luTDNxdmd2cVhCU1V2WTRfMUlhbFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;A new fitness trend from Japan has been making waves online—Japanese walking. It promises solid health benefits, demands little gear or time and offers a fresh way to add variety to your training. Is it something runners should consider? Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What is Japanese walking?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking, developed by &lt;strong&gt;Hiroshi Nose&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shizue Masuki, &lt;/strong&gt;both professors at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan, is essentially interval &lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/injuries/walking-backward-the-secret-to-fixing-knee-pain/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of steady, continuous steps, it alternates between walking briskly for three minutes and then slowing down for three minutes, repeated for at least 30 minutes, several times a week. The fast segments should push you to a pace that’s “somewhat hard,” where chatting gets tricky but still doable. The slower parts allow for easier breathing and comfortable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a gentler, lower-impact cousin to traditional high-intensity&lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/short-vs-long-intervals-which-is-better/"&gt; interval training&lt;/a&gt; (HIIT). You don’t need special equipment, just a stopwatch and some space to walk. That simplicity, along with the relatively short sessions, makes it an attractive option for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-102110 size-large lazyload" data-src="https://runningmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/running-friends-1024x683.jpg" alt="Running friends" data-srcset="https://runningmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/running-friends-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://runningmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/running-friends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://runningmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/running-friends-768x512.jpg 768w, https://runningmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/running-friends.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that Japanese walking offers solid health benefits that can complement running. Looking for some movement on your recovery day that is a step above a leisurely stroll? Compared to steady, moderate walking, interval walking helps shed more weight, lower blood pressure and build leg strength, all key factors that support better running performance. Some studies even suggest that, similar to running, it can slow the typical age-related decline in strength and aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does it fit into running?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runners looking for ways to mix up their training might find Japanese walking a helpful cross-training tool. It offers cardiovascular benefits and muscle engagement without the pounding that running can sometimes bring. That means it’s &lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/why-rebounding-might-be-your-new-favourite-cross-training-activity/"&gt;easier on the joints&lt;/a&gt; and muscles, and perfect for active recovery days or for those nursing minor aches. If you’re a runner seeking low-impact cross-training or an alternative cardio workout, it’s worth a shot.&lt;br&gt;
That said, Japanese walking shouldn’t replace running. The intensity and impact levels differ. Running builds specific adaptations like &lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/health-nutrition/do-these-5-things-to-keep-your-bones-strong/"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt; and running economy that walking can’t fully match. Instead, Japanese walking can complement your running while reducing injury risk.&lt;/p&gt;

But a growing anti-sunscreen movement has taken hold on social media, causing confusion about its benefits and alarming public health experts who say avoiding sunscreen increases long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How does sunscreen work, and what’s in it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sunscreen protects the skin by either absorbing or reflecting ultraviolet rays that can cause sunburn, premature aging and skin cancer. Most sunscreen formulas fall into two categories: chemical and mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chemical sunscreens form a thin protective film to absorb UV radiation. They use ingredients such as avobenzone, oxybenzone and octocrylene to absorb UV radiation and convert it into heat before it reaches the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mineral sunscreens rely on zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to physically block UV rays from reaching the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why is there skepticism of sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More Americans are questioning the safety of everyday products, driven by a growing distrust in conventional health advice, pharmaceutical companies and federal regulators. Among them are supporters of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again movement, who have helped revive skepticism of sunscreen ingredients such as oxybenzone and titanium dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people are also looking for natural alternatives, and they say skin irritation they have experienced from certain products has caused them to shift from conventional products. As a result, alternatives like homemade creams and mineral-based sunscreens have become more popular. Some people are also choosing to stop using sunscreen entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I am definitely a MAHA mom and voted for Trump so that RFK Jr. could get into office,” said Summer Whiteside, 31, an ER nurse from Wildomar, California, in a text message. “After listening to his podcast on Joe Rogan, I knew he was the man for the job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Instagram, Whiteside, who doesn’t shy away from the label “crunchy,” posts about things like beef tallow for sunburns and her preference for mineral sunscreen. Whiteside, who said she has concerns about the chemicals in sunscreen, uses long-sleeved rash guards on her kids and sunblock only on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some wellness figures have claimed that diet changes or building sun exposure gradually can protect against burns, which dermatologists and the scientific community strongly recommend against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some in the anti-sunscreen movement point to studies suggesting that certain chemicals cause cancer or are absorbed too heavily into the body. But public health experts say there are no human studies that conclusively prove ingredients like oxybenzone act as carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Oxybenzone has been used since the 1970s in sunscreen, so we would have found out by now if it caused harm,” said Henry W. Lim, senior vice president of academic affairs and former chair of dermatology at Henry Ford Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lim said that some groups will use testing methods and safety thresholds in studies that differ from those required for product approval in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of the concerns come from animal studies using high doses, but those results don’t automatically translate to humans,” said Lim, who is also the president of the International League of Dermatological Societies and a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What do health experts and science say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health professionals warn that anti-sunscreen messaging can be harmful for the public because skin cancer remains one of the most common types of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Experts say sunscreen is one of the most effective tools for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Adam Friedman, a professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University, said skepticism of sunscreen is nothing new. Concerns about chemical ingredients and mistrust in federal oversight resurface every few years, often fueled by social media and wellness trends. But he said the science has remained consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ultraviolet radiation is a known carcinogen; there is no debate about that,” Friedman said. “We’ve had decades of data showing that sunscreen plays a critical role in reducing skin cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Studies have shown that regular sunscreen use significantly reduces the risk of skin cancer. A randomized controlled trial in Australia known as the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial followed more than 1,600 participants for about 10 years. Those who used sunscreen daily had a lower incidence of melanoma compared with those who used it occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another prospective cohort study of more than 143,000 Norwegian women found that using an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen was associated with a 33 percent lower risk of melanoma compared with people using less than an SPF 15 or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Academy of Dermatology recommends broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. Mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are considered safe by dermatologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Veena Vanchinathan, a board-certified dermatologist in California and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, said the hesitation regarding sunscreen use in wellness spaces is not supported by current scientific evidence. She explained that just because a sunscreen ingredient is absorbed into the body doesn’t mean it is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We see small amounts of absorption from many everyday products without any proven risk,” Vanchinathan said. “Our skin is designed to function as a barrier, not a sponge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her bigger concern is that people are skipping sunscreen altogether or using ineffective unproven alternatives like coconut oil or beef tallow. This could lead to more preventable sun damage, especially among younger people who are influenced by wellness content online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why does the U.S. have fewer sunscreen options than Europe and Asia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration regulates sunscreen, but U.S. standards have not kept up. The last major sunscreen monograph proposal came in 1999. This document serves as the FDA’s official guideline for what ingredients can be used in over-the-counter sunscreens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although the agency proposed updates in recent years, delays have left many newer active ingredients, which are already used in Europe and Asia, unavailable in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This regulatory delay has drawn criticism from dermatologists and public health experts who say the U.S. is falling behind global standards and giving consumers fewer safe options. Some people, frustrated by the lack of innovation, are turning to imported products or homemade solutions, which Friedman strongly discourages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Would you make Tylenol or Advil in your bathtub?” Friedman said. “There’s no way to replicate the safety, testing and effectiveness of a professionally formulated sunscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other countries often approve sunscreen filters faster by following a different regulatory model that emphasizes post-market surveillance and international data. The European Commission evaluates sunscreen ingredients under a cosmetics framework that allows newer filters to reach the market more quickly. Some advocacy groups are calling on Congress to require faster review timelines or align with international standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dermatologists say the science continues to support daily use of FDA-approved sunscreens to prevent skin cancer. They warn that avoiding sunscreen altogether poses a far greater risk than any concern about ingredient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/08/08/mark-lewis-sand-sculptures-art-england/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:He builds sand sculptures for joy.

Authorities say the outbreak, traced to broccoli in oil used in sandwiches, has raised urgent food safety concerns and triggered seizures of contaminated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local media report that the victim, 52-year-old artist and musician Luigi Di Sarno, was on holiday with his family in Calabria when he purchased a broccoli and sausage sandwich from a vendor on the Diamante seafront in Cosenza province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after eating, Di Sarno fell severely ill while driving home and died before reaching the hospital on Thursday. His family, two women in their 40s and two 17-year-olds, also became sick and required emergency treatment at Annunziata Hospital in Cosenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical staff told reporters the patients showed signs consistent with botulism, a rare but potentially deadly illness caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Di Sarno’s relatives were in serious condition upon arrival at the intensive care unit, according to hospital sources. The Paola Public Prosecutor’s Office has ordered the seizure of broccoli jars in oil and impounded the food truck linked to the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autopsy is being finalized to determine the exact cause of death, but local outlets report botulism is strongly suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Second suspected &lt;keyword id="28239682" type="General" weightage="100" keywordseo="botulism-outbreak-in-Italy" source="keywords"&gt;botulism outbreak in Italy&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tragedy comes just days after a separate botulism scare in Sardinia, where eight people were hospitalized after consuming guacamole from a Mexican food stand at Fiesta Latina, held in Monserrato between July 22 and 25. Local authorities believe the dip may have been contaminated with the same toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To respond to both incidents, health officials have flown in vials of antitoxin serum to treat patients. They said, "No region or hospital in the country is authorised to store the antivenom in their own facilities. This serum, however, is exclusively available to the Ministry of Health, which holds it in designated secure locations and distributes it only through the Lombardy Poison Control Centre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities continue to investigate both outbreaks while urging consumers to avoid eating recalled broccoli products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is botulism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botulism is a rare yet dangerous illness caused by a toxin that targets the body’s nerves and can lead to life-threatening complications. The toxin is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It can develop from contaminated food, infected wounds, or, in infants, when bacterial spores grow in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, botulism can occur when excessive amounts of botulinum toxin are injected for cosmetic or medical purposes.

Lyme disease is pretty well established in Canada at this point," said Thomas Daniels, the director of the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University's biological field station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease-carrying deer ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and they thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It likes to be in humid areas, not wet areas, but humid areas," said Daniels. "If you sample on a lawn that gets baked in the sun all day, you're not going to find ticks. You go 20 feet into the woods where it's shady and the temperature's generally lower and there's more ground cover, you will find ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat from ticks and mosquitoes, which drive transmission of diseases such as West Nile, dengue and malaria, is already increasing, including &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51354964" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;in Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of increases in temperature that we've already seen, because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America," Erin Mordecai, an associate professor of biology at Stanford University, said at a news briefing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while climate change is contributing to the expansion of tick habitats, it's not the sole driver. Human changes to landscapes also shape where ticks are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's never just one factor, right?" Jean Tsao, a professor at Michigan State University who studies disease ecology, said at a news briefing. "In the continental U.S., most of the changes in the range is probably due to land use change affecting wildlife communities. Also, management of wildlife populations, such as the white-tailed deer. That plays a major role for many of these ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Lyme disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, are the prima&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;y ticks that carry Lyme disease. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, the ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss. As they feed on blood, they can transmit pathogens, including the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This transmission occurs through the tick's saliva, which enters the host's bloodstream during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, told CNN on Friday that infection can cause a range of multisystem symptoms. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can go to various parts of the body, including the heart, central nervous system, the brain or peripheral nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Erin Mordecai, associate professor of biology at Stanford University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onset of Lyme disease may also present in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people think of the Lyme rash as a bull's-eye target rash. In fact, that's not the most common presentation," said Fallon. "The most common presentation is more of a pinkish, reddish rash. But the main thing is that it expands in size from a small rash to 5 centimeters or larger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon notes that some people may also see more than one rash on different parts of their body. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. Symptoms may last for months or even years, said Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's recognized mainly by the rash early on, if you're lucky enough to see it, and then later, by symptoms such as the neurologic symptoms that may manifest as a facial palsy or a meningitis causing severe headaches with stiff neck or shooting pains or severe stabbing pains," Fallon said. There may be cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or slow rhythms, muscle pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be profoundly debilitating," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protective measures are 'not foolproof'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels says that although there are measures that can be taken to decrease the likelihood of a tick bite, prevention methods are not foolproof. The most important protection against Lyme disease is tick removal as soon as possible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is to get the tick off you as quickly as possible. None of these (tick-borne) pathogens are transmitted very quickly, except for Powassan virus, which can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes. But the infection rate for (humans) is very, very low," said Daniels. "For Lyme disease, you've got a 24- to 48-hour window of opportunity there to get the tick off, because it takes some time for the tick to gear up through its feeding to actually transmit the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels advises people to wear more clothes in the summertime. "The longer we can keep the tick on the outside of our bodies and not on our skin, the less likely it is to find a place to attach." Clothes can also be treated with permethrin, an insecticide that repels ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;(Lyme disease) can be profoundly debilitating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hiking, Fallon advises people to stay on the trail, as ticks roam in leafy areas and wood piles. Daniels advises people to conduct a "tick check" for themselves and each other if they're in an area with ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's helpful because the ticks may go behind your knee, or they may go and bite you in the back, and you can't see your back or reach your back. Take a shower at the end of the day, because that may help to wash off some ticks that haven't fully attached yet," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick is attached for a prolonged period of time, Fallon says that it would gradually "blow up as big as a raisin" from continuously sucking blood. If you do find a tick, experts advise people to use tweezers to remove the tick from underneath its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't try to burn it off with a cigarette. Don't try to put anything toxic on it. Remove it with a tweezer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — who served during the first Trump administration — argued Sunday that "people are going to die" if the U.S. backs away from mRNA vaccine development, after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted around $500 million in research funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-halts-500-million-for-mrna-vaccine-research/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week that the administration was canceling 22 mRNA vaccine development projects, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the vaccines "fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu." The projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Kennedy said the funds would be shifted toward "safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are "simply not true" — citing their effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which hundreds of millions of people took Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that by the most conservative estimates, upward of 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology," Adams said. "It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology was central to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership aimed at quickly developing COVID-19 vaccines at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic near the end of Mr. Trump's first term. If the U.S. had relied on older vaccine technology, it could have taken an extra 18 to 24 months to develop COVID-19 shots, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Kennedy's move by CBS News earlier this week, Mr. Trump said, "Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country," while noting that he had upcoming meetings on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who was involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort, said it's "fascinating" to him that, as Mr. Trump and his allies discuss whether he deserves a Nobel Prize, "the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general explained that mRNA is a type of natural molecule that's present in the body and operates like a "recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond COVID-19, Adams said the technology "helps us develop vaccines and new treatments" in other areas — from cancers and HIV to the flu and the Zika virus. The funding cuts could halt progress in one of the "most promising areas of modern medicine," the former surgeon general said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are advances that are not going to happen now," Adams said. "People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;After Atlanta CDC shooting, Adams said "Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams also criticized Kennedy for his response to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention buildings in Atlanta on Friday. Investigators have been looking into possible motives, including the possibility that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine, multiple sources told &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. Quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard," Adams said, accusing Kennedy of issuing "tepid response" to the  shooting, while adding, "and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Friday, Kennedy said, "No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." But Adams argued Kennedy has not "unequivocally condemned the violence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an out there," Adams said. "If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's okay to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general said people at the CDC were calling him after the shooting asking him to make a public statement "because they felt under attack." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't know if this was going to continue," Adams said. "They were scared, and they wanted someone, someone who they felt had a public voice, to go out there and say, 'This is wrong. Violence is wrong.'"&lt;/p&gt;

In November 2023, she then underwent a "stem cell transplant from a donor to help her create healthy new blood cells and reduce the risk of the cancer returning," according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt really good after the stem cell transplant,” Smith said. “I’ve always been on the go, really active and busy, and I felt like my usual self again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was still coming for regular check-ups at Clatterbridge and, in September 2024, my routine bone marrow biopsy showed I had relapsed and the cancer was back. I just wasn’t expecting it so, as you can imagine, I was completely shocked," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a Tuesday and I went home thinking this was the end for me, then on the Friday I got a lovely phone call from the consultant, Dr. Saif, to say he’d been working behind the scenes to try and find another treatment for me and I’d been accepted for CAR-T therapy," she added, referencing the chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, which is a highly innovative form of immunotherapy, per the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty&lt;/p&gt; A photo of the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Liverpool, U.K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/car-t-cell.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, CAR-T therapy "is a way to get immune cells called T cells (a type of white blood cell) to fight cancer by changing them in the lab so they can find and destroy cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This type of treatment can be very helpful in treating some types of cancer, even when other treatments are no longer working," according to the society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about being accepted for the treatment, Smith said, “I went from literally the worst time in life to feeling like I’d just won the lottery because there was a little bit of hope there," per the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to CAR-T therapy not being available in Liverpool until the end of 2024, Smith was referred to The Christie in Manchester for her to receive treatment as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the approximately 34-mile journey to Manchester was "exhausting," adding, "We were over and back about 20 times in all for consultations, cell collection, chemotherapy, infusion and follow-up appointments afterwards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust&lt;/p&gt; Sharon Smith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also had to stay in the city for three and a half weeks "during the most intensive stage of treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gone to Manchester to have T cells taken from her blood, Smith's cells were then taken to a specialist pharmaceutical laboratory to be transformed into a "unique" CAR-T treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then had to undergo chemotherapy in Manchester to prepare her body before the treatment began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some side effects, the treatment was successful and Smith "recovered quickly," according to the hospital's news release.
