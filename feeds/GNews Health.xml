Kennedy Jr. said at a Senate hearing on Thursday that children receive up to 92 vaccine doses in early childhood "in order to be fully compliant between maternity and 18 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But doctors tell ABC News that that number isn't accurate. Excluding annual flu and COVID-19 shots, children generally receive roughly 30 vaccine doses – many in combined injections – before the age of 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combination vaccines are single shots that include two or more vaccines that might otherwise be given separately: the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is a common example. This reduces the number of shots children get while protecting them from the same number of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, vaccines given today contain far fewer antigens – that is, substances that trigger an immune response in the body – &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/science-behind-vaccine-schedule" target="_blank"&gt;than vaccines did decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/vaccine-studies-examine-the-evidence.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown these vaccines are safe and effective and do not overwhelm the immune system, as Kennedy has previously suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How many vaccines are recommended?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the Senate hearing, Kennedy said, "When I was a kid, I got three vaccines. I was fully compliant. Today's children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/science-history/vaccine-history/developments-by-year" target="_blank"&gt;The number of available, recommended immunizations has grown&lt;/a&gt; since the first vaccines were recommended in the late 1940s based on evolving science and manufacturing capacity. For example, children can now receive a chickenpox vaccine, which became available in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When Kennedy was a young child in the 1950s, there were three vaccines recommended to protect against smallpox, poliovirus, and a combined shot that included diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A member of medical staff administers a dose of the measles vaccine to a child at a health center in Lubbock, Texas, Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Currently, younger children, who are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, receive dozens of shots in the early years of life, but doctors told ABC News that the numbers shared by Kennedy are an overcount and a misleading criticism of the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Even now, there are no vaccines for most of the hundreds of known infectious diseases.

Because several routine vaccines are combined and given in the same injection, that number of shots can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I count 33 doses from birth to 18 years on the immunization schedule. Many of those can be given as combination vaccines, particularly at the early ages," Dr. Pia Pannaraj, a professor of pediatrics and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Diseases, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If that still sounds like a lot, consider the number of germs children are exposed to every day, pediatricians say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Kids are exposed to 2,000 to 6,000 antigens every day just by playing at the playground or going to school. That is significantly more than what they receive in vaccines," Pannaraj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you count RSV, there are 18 or 19 infections for which children are recommended to be vaccinated against," Dr. Robert W. Frenck, Jr., pediatrician and chair of the AAP Section on Infectious Disease, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Frenck noted that many vaccines are combination vaccines. These include the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, polio vaccine, and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Most vaccines need two to three doses, some four to five to complete the series. But it is not 60 to 90 vaccines," Frenck said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Studies have also shown that vaccines do not overwhelm or weaken the immune system and don't make children more susceptible to other infections.

That's not for nothing, either: they're genuinely great family dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a classic combo, and it never gets less awesome to watch. Just look at this video from Tuesday, September 9th, when one Golden retriever refused to let his favorite tiny human nap unattended. He was falling asleep too, but he was not about to let anything slip by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marleynyc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marley the Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marley the Golden Retriever &lt;/a&gt;is so sweet.

He lives in New York City with mom, dad, and their brand new baby. He used to be the only child in the house, which sometimes makes dogs angry. They don't like to share the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't a problem for Marley, though: he was fine with that. Now, he has three siblings! He just wanted a friend, and the new baby was exactly what he needed. As soon as mom let him close to the baby, he was there. He was ready to show her he could be a good boy, and he did an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Them meeting was just too cute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micro-Gary is an awesome name for a baby. I think I'm going to name my first baby that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retrievers Know How to be Gentle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that Golden Retrievers are so popular in families is that they're like little mirrors. They match energies incredibly well: if you have a baby, they love snuggly naps and lying around while they play. As your baby grows, they love to run, play, and catch the food they drop on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these dogs can definitely be overbearing and very playful, they're also easy to train.

            More school-age children and adolescents are now &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt; than underweight, a new report from the United Nations’ children’s agency, UNICEF, has revealed, with 188 million young people affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460002356n9zactc0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/health/obesity-underweight-world-who-study"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; now exceeds underweight in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, researchers found, having studied data from more than 190 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460003356nzqgqt8dm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obesity occurs when a person has excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Children are deemed overweight when they are “significantly heavier than what is healthy for their age, sex and height,” UNICEF noted, adding that obesity is a severe form of overweight that leads to a higher risk of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460004356nck226z34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studying data from more than 190 countries, researchers found that in the past 25 years, the number of overweight children has doubled from 194 million to 391 million. Of those, a high proportion are classified as obese, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfe0xyhq0001356nk3ndtetm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The highest rates of obesity are seen in some Pacific Island nations, including 38% of 5- to 19-year-olds in Niue, 37% in the Cook Islands, and 33% in Nauru.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460005356nts2ost6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High-income countries also had high levels of obesity, including 27% 5- to 19-year-olds in Chile, and 21% in both the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460006356nqkjf6hcc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Excluding sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions, researchers said, with ultra-processed and fast foods that are high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives being targeted at and consumed by children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460007356n745djb9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460008356nqrvi64sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children. Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfe15cwy0000356nihp1n8mb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers noted that in high-income countries, overweight tended to be more common among children and adolescents in poorer households, eating nutrient-poor, unhealthy diets. However, in low-income countries, children were more likely to be overweight if they were from wealthier families who could afford larger quantities of food, including energy-dense food. In middle-income countries, the presence of overweight in children spanned all income categories, with ultra-processed foods and drinks more widely available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460009356nee7bzds6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of underweight children aged 5-19 has declined since 2000, from nearly 13% to 9.2%, researchers added, but they noted that undernutrition was still a “significant concern” among children under 5 in most low- and middle-income countries. Undernutrition can present as wasting, or stunting, the report added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DELAWARE COUNTY, Ohio — The Delaware Public Health District issued &lt;a href="https://www.delawarehealth.org/health-alerts/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.delawarehealth.org/health-alerts/"&gt;an alert&lt;/a&gt; on Monday following an increase in cases and outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease in the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency says there have been cases and outbreaks, particularly in day care centers, schools and among school-aged children since the beginning of last month.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is a very contagious and common illness that causes fever, mouth sores and skin rash, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus mostly affects infants and children, but older adolescents and adults can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms usually appear three to six days after exposure and can include fever, sore throat, painful mouth sores that may start as small red spots and turn into blisters, and a skin rash of flat or raised red spots or blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults can become infected and show no symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does hand, foot and mouth disease spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can get hand, foot and mouth disease by:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coming into contact with droplets that have virus particles after a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching an infected person or making other close contact like kissing, hugging or sharing cups or eating utensils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching an infected person’s feces, such as changing diapers, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching objects and surfaces that have the virus on them, such as doorknobs or toys, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and day cares should encourage and enforce regular hand washing among students and staff. People should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and shared items and avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth to help stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you treat hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPHD says there is no vaccine or specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. According to the CDC, most people get better in seven to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. To help manage symptoms, people can take over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain. Do not give children aspirin, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are encouraged to drink liquids so they can prevent dehydration. The CDC says mouth sores can make it painful to swallow, so kids may not want to drink much. Parents are encouraged to make sure their kids stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When can kids return to school and day care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPHD says kids can go to school and day care as long as they have no fever for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and feel well enough to be in class.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: Our son passed away at 38 years old this past December with an end-stage alcohol-related liver disease. He had been sober for four years prior to this, but blood tests revealed that he had started drinking again. These same tests showed copper level readings in the 500s and liver deterioration in accordance with someone twice his age, which indicated the possibility of him having Wilson’s disease (a rare genetic liver disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6VXIWKVFFZFILPEW5SDNPEMYG4"&gt;He was in need of an immediate liver transplant, but this surgery wasn’t possible due to multiple varices, a large mass in his stomach, a failing kidney, and the fact that he would possibly bleed out from a surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZH2AMRXJPVHCDBYUKCEA5SR76Q"&gt;He had blood in his vomit and stools for at least two days (maybe more?) before going to the hospital. He hadn’t been feeling well for at least three weeks before then. He required over 11 units of blood during the first three to four days in the hospital and occasionally some after the treatment of his varices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AB3RNEJZPJAS7HEF7LO6H3QOYI"&gt;My question to you is, could his death have been prevented if he had gone to the hospital even a day earlier? -- B.Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HRM3O3GYUNHNJO5WJMJJPGW64U"&gt;ANSWER: I am very sorry for your son and for the fact that you have been dealing with potential guilt for so long. Wilson’s disease is, as you say, a rare genetic disease with abnormal copper metabolism, leading to copper deposition in the liver, eyes and brain. People with Wilson’s disease can have chronic liver disease or acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U7VPMGZIEBATNFTJMFL5CC4Q24"&gt;From what you are telling me, I think your son had did have chronic liver disease. (Varices are dilated blood vessels in the lower esophagus, which form due to high pressure in the portal veins of the liver, but this takes months or years to develop.) But I think he died of acute-on-chronic liver failure. The kidney disease and bleeding issues suggest this diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JEW7PB6A4JAK3LFQ5D4ZCAV5OQ"&gt;A day or a week wouldn’t have made a difference. Making the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease years earlier so that he could have avoided high-copper foods and starting him on chelation treatment would have prevented this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVVYMDTFV5HRRGWPM7MSX4SJWU"&gt;Having him avoid alcohol meticulously would have been helpful. Heavy alcohol use or binge-drinking on top of Wilson’s is very dangerous, and patients with Wilson’s are advised to avoid alcohol entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZZ7NFIQSRBGATDEUEDXK6IERL4"&gt;During acute-on-chronic liver failure, a liver transplant can be lifesaving, but it does sound like it was too late, probably weeks too late (considering the wait for organ transplants) for your son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: When I sit down on my recliner to take a break and read for a while, I will often doze off. But just when I’m slipping into a nap, my body makes a little spasm or jerk, which causes me to bite my tongue and, of course, painfully wakes me up. This happens every time, so I never get a nap!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5YKJQRU2ZJHVROLCFQXHNXCLKY"&gt;Have you heard of this, does it indicate a problem other than the obvious, and is there anything that might be done for it? -- S.T.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SLS4BEGRXNGLJEV7LHL6MLCP4M"&gt;ANSWER: Myoclonic jerks are common, especially when people are falling asleep. They do not normally indicate any particular nerve or muscle disorder, so it doesn’t need treatment. It’s a mystery to me why you notice them for naps but not at night during bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LSGFVW4VXRFXDHISZOGJCRWNVU"&gt;A night guard to protect your teeth and tongue might help you.

			&lt;p&gt;Bacteria normally found in the mouth could play a direct role in triggering a heart attack, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an examination of the arterial plaques collected from more than 200 patients with coronary artery disease, a team of scientists led by Tampere University in Finland found a surprisingly high percentage contained oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking," &lt;a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/news/myocardial-infarction-may-be-infectious-disease"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Tampere physician Pekka Karhunen. "Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material – DNA – from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poor Oral Hygiene Could Be Taking a Toll on Your Heart, Expert Says&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/hygiene5020014"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2015.03.001"&gt;established a connection between oral health and cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. The two often go &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1010368"&gt;hand-in-hand&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Karhunen and his colleagues to seek biomarkers that might explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of their study was one of the main drivers of heart attack: &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. This is the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, consisting of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances on the artery walls. It narrows the arteries, restricting blood flow, and sometimes even ruptures. This can prevent oxygen from reaching the heart, causing cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sampled coronary plaques from 121 patients who had died suddenly, as well as 96 patients who had undergone surgery to remove plaque from their blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team subjected these samples to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00108"&gt;quantitative polymerase chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; analysis, a technique for identifying microbes. They also used immunohistochemistry, which uses  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="173555" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to identify specific toxins, and transcriptomics, which quantifies gene expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assays revealed biofilms of several types of oral bacteria, the most common of which belonged to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viridans_streptococci"&gt;viridans streptococci&lt;/a&gt; group. Oral streptococci were found in 42.1 percent of coronary plaques from the sudden death patients and 42.9 percent of surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173719" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque.png" alt="Your Own Mouth Bacteria Could Give You a Heart Attack" class="wp-image-173719 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque.png 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque-622x415.png 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173719" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A bacterial biofilm (red) found inside a coronary artery plaque. (Pekka Karhunen's research group/Tampere University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these bacteria was strongly correlated with severe atherosclerosis, death from heart disease, and death from a heart attack, the researchers found, particularly associated with a ruptured plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterial biofilms tended to be found right at the core of the plaques, out of reach of the body's immune response. If something else happens to the patient that adds more stress to the body, the biofilm could become inflamed, causing the plaque to rupture, thus triggering a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that other bacterial infections, respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="173555" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, poor diet, or the stress hormone norepinephrine could be potential culprits for triggering that inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation is needed to narrow down the role of oral bacteria in heart attacks, as well as identify the dangerous exacerbating factors and how the bugs get there in the first place. However, the results strongly suggest that oral health is far more important to heart health than we knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The present results suggest that the change from a stable soft‐core coronary atheroma into a vulnerable rupture‐prone coronary plaque, as well as the development of a symptomatic peripheral artery plaque, may be contributed to by a chronic bacterial infection in the form of a dormant biofilm that colonizes the lipid core and wall of the atheroma and evades immune detection," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding adds to the current conception of the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and opens new possibilities for the diagnostics and prevention of the fatal complications of atherosclerosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and international collaborators have discovered a previously unrecognized new player mediating clinically relevant effects of metformin: the brain. By uncovering a brain pathway involved in metformin's anti-diabetic action, researchers have discovered new possibilities for treating diabetes more effectively and precisely. The study appeared in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut," said corresponding author Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics - nutrition at Baylor. "We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team focused on a small protein called Rap1, found in a specific part of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The researchers discovered that metformin's ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on turning off Rap1 in this brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, the Fukuda lab and his colleagues used genetically modified mice that lacked Rap1 in their VMH. These mice were fed a high-fat diet to mimic type 2 diabetes. When given low doses of metformin, the drug failed to lower their blood sugar. However, other diabetes medications like insulin and GLP-1 agonists still worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further show that the brain is a key player, the researchers injected tiny amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. The result was a significant drop in blood sugar, even with doses thousands of times smaller than what's typically given by mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin's effects," Fukuda said. "We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they're directly involved in the drug's action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to "switch on" these brain cells and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery changes how we think about metformin," Fukuda said. "It's not just working in the liver or the gut, it's also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. "These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain," Fukuda said. "In addition, metformin is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;

            A vaccine used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/06/australia/australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-dst-hnk"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; in Australia’s&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/australia/australia-endangered-koalas-queensland-intl-hnk-dst"&gt; koala population&lt;/a&gt; has been approved for rollout, in a world-first project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3y0002356nbnbizxab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from the University of the Sunshine Coast spent more than 10 years developing a single-dose vaccine to protect the famed Australian marsupial from the effects of chlamydia, which include urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death, the university said in a statement Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0003356nxq66mb4d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia is responsible for half of koala deaths in the country’s wild populations, which are predominantly found in the eucalyptus forests along Australia’s eastern coast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0004356nfsb1iofh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent,” Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at UniSC’s Centre for Bioinnovation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/koala-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0005356nzt6d4790@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often used as an emblem of Australian culture, the fluffy gray marsupials can only be found in Australia, and are considered endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Aside from disease, the creatures are vulnerable to habitat loss, animal attacks and being hit by cars, and were named critically endangered in 2022, &lt;a href="https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/koala/" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;Australia’s World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            They are also often victims of the deadly bushfires that have ravaged Australia in its summer months in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/australia/koalas-reduce-one-third-intl-hnk"&gt;recent years.&lt;/a&gt; This year, some 860 koalas in Budj Bim National Park were shot from the air to “reduce suffering” after a bushfire, CNN affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/koalas-shooting-victoria-national-park-petition/75fc6dee-9de9-4944-84c7-991c68bb9faa" target="_blank"&gt;9News reported.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0006356noo2b6qpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antibiotics were previously used to treat chlamydia in koalas, but the drugs often interfere with their ability to digest their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, causing them to starve to death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0007356nnsyngqge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for production and widespread use, in a what researchers describe as a “world first,” the chlamydia vaccine has already been trialed on hundreds of wild and captive koalas, according to UniSC, which noted it had already been tested across multiple generations of the animal in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;a study published last year.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0008356n01rr3x41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study found that the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65 percent,” said researcher Sam Phillips, who led the study, which was the largest and longest study of wild koalas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0009356nmisgbd2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s based on Chlamydia pecorum’s major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection — reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000a356nfgz5jc4a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In humans, chlamydia is a bacterial &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/health/college-hookup-culture-wellness"&gt;sexually transmitted infection&lt;/a&gt; that can cause infertility if left untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000b356nbmqv64y1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating. In addition, baby koalas — known as joeys — can catch the disease from their mothers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

He decided to call his insurance company to make sure the shots were still covered. The customer service representative told him they only covered COVID shots given at a doctor’s office. So he called his doctor’s office at UCSF Medical Center to schedule an appointment. They told him they wouldn’t have the new shots in until October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jennifer Minton, 64, of Tiburon said she and her husband went to a local CVS without an appointment last Thursday and asked for COVID, flu and measles shots. They were able to get them right away, and their PPO insurance plan covered the entire cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody asked us anything about our age, we got our three vaccinations each and that was it,” she said. “We weren’t asked to pay a dime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even at pharmacy chains where the shots are available, you may have to try multiple locations, or even different pharmacists within the same location, according to UC Berkeley infectious disease expert John Swartzberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem is, the pharmacists are confused as well,” he said. “The doctors are confused as well. People are getting disparate advice from physicians and pharmacists because they’re confused. And the pharmacy companies are confused as to what to do. So they have varying policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, federal guidance recommended an annual COVID booster for everyone 6 months and older. But under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, federal regulators recently &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/fda-limits-covid-vaccine-eligibility-21018315.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;narrowed eligibility sharply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated approvals from the Food and Drug Administration state that the latest COVID vaccines are restricted to people at high risk for severe outcomes from the disease, including people 65 and older and those “who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s similar to the guidance during the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021 — but back then, access was restricted only because of limited supply, said Paula Cannon, a virology professor at USC Keck School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a rationing based on, ‘We want everybody to have it, but let’s get the most seriously impacted people vaccinated first,’” Cannon said. Over the following months, the shots became widely available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, she said, “This restriction is based on, well, politics. It’s not based on sound science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and chaos over who can get a vaccine, and where and how and how much it will cost, all lead to one known outcome, said Swartzberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there’s confusion about these kinds of questions, the default for most people is to just not get vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said just in the past week, he’s heard from three people who’ve faced issues getting a vaccine in the Bay Area. He said even if Kennedy and the FDA were to reverse course and say, never mind, anyone can get it — which is very unlikely — the damage is already done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say for certain this is purposeful, but I can say the people making these decisions know that by creating confusion and creating barriers to getting vaccines, you decrease vaccine uptake,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And booster uptake was already low. In December 2021, the first year vaccines were available to everyone, 85% of Americans had gotten one. As of May 2024, only 22.5% of Americans were up to date on COVID shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear, Cannon and Swartzberg said: The COVID vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective. They substantially reduce your chance of severe infection and of needing to be hospitalized if you do get infected. And they greatly reduce your odds of dying of COVID. They also reduce your chance of getting infected, though only modestly, and only for a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon said that while we’ve seen COVID genetically mutate into different strains since March 2020, “the virus hasn’t changed as massively as much as it has in recent years.” She said last year’s COVID shot still offers solid protection against the currently circulating variants. The main reason to get this year’s updated booster is because protection from them wanes so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California public health officer Dr. Erica Pan said in a briefing with medical professionals Tuesday that the state is rejecting the new federal rules and instead endorsing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from national medical professional organizations, which are in line with previous CDC and FDA guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recognize there is a lot of confusion, a lot of access issues,” she said. “We’ll likely have updates very soon on what we’re doing in California to promote insurance coverage, vaccine access and scope of practice for pharmacists and others to be able to provide vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Department of Public Health said Tuesday it expects to align with the state’s “science-based vaccine recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I get the updated COVID vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you had COVID during this year’s summer peak, experts recommend waiting between 3 and 6 months before getting an updated shot. That way, you take advantage of your natural immunity while you’ve got it, and spread out the protection from the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you do want to get your updated COVID vaccine right away and you are under 65, you likely can get it at a chain pharmacy like CVS, Walgreens, Safeway or Costco — where “most of us get our routine vaccines,” former Marin County Health Officer Matt Willis &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/how-to-find-the-new-covid-vaccine" data-link="native" class=""&gt;wrote on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all have received supplies of the updated vaccine, so you’ll need to check their websites or call. (Kaiser also &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/health-wellness/coronavirus-information/vaccine-appointments" data-link="native" class=""&gt;says on its website&lt;/a&gt; that availability of the new shot is pending its experts' review of FDA approval and other federal guidance.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official FDA guidance says “adults 65 years of age and older and individuals 5 through 64 years who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.” The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;CDC maintains a list of those conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a long one. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible you’ll be asked to attest that you have one of those conditions. Willis noted that “California pharmacies don’t ask for medical documentation or a doctor’s prescription for people who self-attest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a bit of a ‘wink wink’ kind of approach,” Cannon said. “It’s a ridiculous system where people have to game the system to do something that is completely and utterly reasonable” — getting a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if you feel you don’t qualify?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’ll all look at the menu and go, mental health disorders, that’s what 2025 has done to me,” Cannon said. “I think we’re all qualified to check that box.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you still determine you can’t attest to any of the conditions, Willis offered this reassurance:  “Your risk for serious illness is low. You probably don’t have to rush to get the shot, and you can always reach out to your medical provider for guidance on getting the shot ‘off label.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 11:02:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOby1VMkNGUFBsQ1pfMlpMX0tuQ2tpeDkxYy10UEYwMkUwM3ZxdGd3YnJHbTJkOGtuSV9tVFRTQ1djeUlwYVRRYzFJRHh0R0U1al9WWnh4NjZuWXlOOWZpTGRoUUZaRXQ4UHYyUlBzRnZiOTc4VUFSZWFHelJZaUdwWU9teWNPWEVoejBOWWVPRzlGMzJY</guid></item><item><title>这5个习惯让您的医生疯狂—并使您的健康处于危险之中- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-habits-annoy-doctors_l_68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people visit the doctor to help get or stay healthy. But health care providers can only work with the information you present to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re dealing with a chronic health issue, the last thing you want to do is undermine a doctor’s efforts to help you get well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s so important to have a good doctor-patient relationship because the more your doctor knows you and your health, the better your care can be,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/zachary-bittinger-md-112037" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Zachary Bittinger" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/zachary-bittinger-md-112037" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Zachary Bittinger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a clinical assistant professor of family and community medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But healthy relationships have boundaries. Making sure that you understand your doctor’s boundaries and your doctor understands yours is a core piece of it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With that in mind, we asked primary care physicians how patients might unintentionally interfere with their own care and what kind of behavior impedes a good doctor-patient relationship. Here’s what they shared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve predetermined your diagnosis and aren’t open to your doctor’s expertise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware that you’ve probably already looked up your symptoms online to try to get some sense of what you could be dealing with ― especially if you’ve been trying to get a proper diagnosis for a long time. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-gaslighting-doctor-sneaky-signs_l_66310bd5e4b0c558f741d4a7" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Many patients experience medical gaslighting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66310bd5e4b0c558f741d4a7" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Many patients experience medical gaslighting&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes the only way to take back control is to do the research yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to acknowledge that health information is everywhere,” Bittinger said. “Sifting through it independently is to be expected these days, and it’s unfair to expect patients to not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a difference between doing some research and insisting that you have a diagnosis without being open to what your doctor says. “It’s a careful balancing act,” Bittinger said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health care providers say they regularly hear from patients with a new health problem who think they know their diagnosis before they’re even examined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people use Google or ChatGPT to diagnose themselves, which can lead to the wrong diagnosis,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michaelazizmd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michael Aziz" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.michaelazizmd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Michael Aziz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; internist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. But that’s potentially dangerous, he noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A strep throat can be similar to flu-like symptoms,” Aziz explained. “A stiff neck can be diagnosed as muscle spasm, when it could be a dangerous case of meningitis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are trained to diagnose you ― and they’ll need to hear about your symptoms and do a full evaluation before they can do that, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=manyon" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Andrea Manyon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=manyon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Andrea Manyon&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of family medicine at the University at Buffalo in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We typically make a diagnosis based on a sequence of information that we obtain from the patient,” she said. “There are certain components of that that lead to us having a differential diagnosis in our mind.” That influences what kind of tests your doctor orders to help give you a proper medical diagnosis, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating that you think you know what your diagnosis is can also create an “implicit bias” in terms of what you take away from your doctor’s appointment, according to &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. David Cutler," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. David Cutler,&lt;/a&gt; a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not to say it will necessarily affect care negatively, but the existence of the bias needs to be recognized, or else inordinate weight may be given to information which confirms this previously-held belief, and information which refutes this belief may not be adequately considered,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, doctors say it’s more than OK to do your own research into your health. But it’s also crucial to be open to their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Morsa Images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Morsa Images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Don't prolong a doctor's appointment, especially if you're experiencing new symptoms.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You put off going to the doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While self-diagnosing can be a big issue, doctors say they also regularly see patients who drag their feet before visiting their physician. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people wait too long before being seen,” Aziz said. Unfortunately, Bittinger noted, that can make it harder for your doctor to treat your issue, given that many conditions tend to worsen over time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bittinger also said it’s crucial to see your health care provider for a persistent issue because they can help ease your fears. “I don’t want people staying up all night, worrying they might have cancer when it could be something else,” he explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You tell your doctor you never drink or smoke when you do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manyon said that “not being straightforward about confounding variables” that can influence your health is a big potential issue she sees a lot. “Things like cigarette use and alcohol use are important to know,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that doctors shouldn’t be judgmental when it comes to a patient’s health, but they do need to have all the information to help make a proper diagnosis and set a treatment plan. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You bring up a health problem at the end of your appointment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a

at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, said it can be frustrating for health care professionals to spend time with a patient, only to have them bring up a big health issue at the end of a

right at the beginning,” she said. “Do not tell me ‘What I really came for was...’ while I am on the way out of the door.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Mahony also requests that patients have patience with the diagnostic process. “I may not have the answer on the first visit,” she said. “If I can’t make a diagnosis, I might order tests, or I might schedule a return visit to monitor if the symptoms are getting better or worse.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p

a medication, talk to your doctor ASAP so you don't experience a lapse in treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You stop taking your medication before chatting with your physician.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Mahony stressed the importance of continuing to communicate with your doctor about your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;treatment plan, especially if it involves a new medication that doesn’t seem to be a good fit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If a treatment does not work or causes some sort of side effect, as a patient, you have to let the doctor know,” she said. “I have patients come to me and tell me that they did not go back to a particular doctor, even though they had a scheduled follow-up appointment, because ‘the medicine they gave me did not work.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That might be really important information for the doctor to hear and likely why they scheduled a follow-up appointment,” she added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, if you have a health issue, doctors underscore how important it is to be open and honest with your doctor about what you’re experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

After all, you’re not getting a dose of high-fructose corn syrup hitting your blood sugar the way normal soda does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it’s still important to monitor how much you’re drinking. &lt;/span&gt;The rapper Fat Joe recently admitted to drinking between &lt;a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/fat-joe-40-diet-soda-a-day" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="30 to 40 cans of Diet Pepsi per day" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.complex.com/music/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/fat-joe-40-diet-soda-a-day" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;30 to 40 cans of Diet Pepsi per day&lt;/a&gt;, and that got us wondering: How much soda is too much&lt;span&gt; diet soda? To find out, we spoke with experts to learn what drinking too much diet soda can do to your body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, a look at the different types of artificial sweeteners in diet soda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Artificial sweeteners are made in a lab and plant-based ones come from natural sources,” said &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-vanessa-rissetto/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Vanessa Rissetto" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://culinahealth.com/founders-vanessa-rissetto/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Vanessa Rissetto&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and CEO and co-founder of Culina Health. However, these are still processed. “They all vary in sweetness intensity, which is why only tiny amounts are used.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&amp;amp;format=webp 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440&amp;amp;format=webp 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="img" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="auto" alt="Do you even know which type of artificial sweetener your favorite diet soda contains?" src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440 2x"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Peter Dazeley via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peter Dazeley via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Do you even know which type of artificial sweetener your favorite diet soda contains?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diet soda will usually be made with one or a mix of the following sweeteners, according to Rissetto: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aspartame: This is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar and breaks down into amino acids in the digestive system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sucralose: Made from sugar, but your body doesn’t process it as sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Saccharin: It is one of the oldest artificial sweeteners and is used as a substitute for sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K): This is often blended with other sweeteners to create a better taste. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevia: A plant-based option that has minimal impact on blood sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monk fruit: Another plant-based option that is often mixed with other sweeteners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any sweeteners better for you than others? “They’re all considered safe in normal amounts,” Rissetto said. “But some people prefer plant-based ones like stevia or monk fruit because they feel ‘more natural’ and they may have less impact on the gut microbiome.” While taste and tolerance are personal, there’s not one that is necessarily considered the healthiest option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpendulumlife.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fmeet-our-new-chief-medical-officer-adam-perlman-md-mph%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRZLofi6j_mI377PPSWTHqxqe6hX2xxs-sZVKjDMqyYETeRFfu" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Adam Perlman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpendulumlife.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fmeet-our-new-chief-medical-officer-adam-perlman-md-mph%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRZLofi6j_mI377PPSWTHqxqe6hX2xxs-sZVKjDMqyYETeRFfu" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Adam Perlman&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pendulum Therapeutics,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said none of these sweeteners are considered “healthy,” but they may be gentler on your body. “Certain artificial sweeteners, like sucralose or saccharin, have been linked to changes in gut bacteria that could influence how your body manages blood sugar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens To Your Body On Diet Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even without sugar, several cans a day have been tied to higher risks for type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke,” Perlman said. &lt;span&gt;“Over time, high intake may be linked to weight gain, heart problems and blood sugar issues.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to type 2 diabetes, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin have the ability to alter the way the body responds to glucose. “They stimulate sweet taste receptors, priming the body to expect calories,” Rissetto explained. “Over time, this mismatch can diminish insulin sensitivity, making it harder for the body to regulate blood sugar.” In addition to this, your gut bacteria can be altered by these sweeteners. This can “impair glucose metabolism and increase inflammation, which are both risk factors for type 2 diabetes,” Rissetto said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your body experiences changes in gut bacteria and insulin resistance, you may have a spike in systemic inflammation, “which is a core mechanism in heart disease,” Rissetto said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease can become a concern for those who drink too much diet soda because the hormonal and metabolic changes from artificial sweeteners can increase triglycerides and lower your “good” cholesterol, HDL, leading to endothelial dysfunction, which is when “chronic exposure to sweeteners and soda additives may damage blood vessel linings, raising blood pressure and atherosclerosis risk,” Rissetto said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your blood vessel health is compromised by frequent consumption of diet soda, there’s a chance you may be at a higher risk of small-vessel disease and impaired vascular function. Paired with the misconception that diet soda doesn’t cause much harm to the body because it doesn’t contain calories, “their biological effects can encourage weight gain, higher blood pressure and diabetes — all strong risk factors for stroke.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rumor that artificial sweeteners cause you to consume more food?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Artificial sweeteners are also known to lead people to consume more sugar or other foods throughout the day. While they don’t deliver calories, your brain’s food reward pathways may get a little confused after drinking a diet soda. “The body expects energy after tasting sweetness — when it doesn’t get it, hunger signals may increase, driving more eating,” Rissetto explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your body also has a dopamine reward cycle, so when tasting something sweet, it triggers a dopamine release in the brain’s reward center. “Without actual energy intake, the ‘reward’ feels incomplete, pushing a person to snack more, especially on sugary or high-carb foods,” Rissetto added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, high intake may be linked to weight gain, heart problems and blood sugar issues,” Perlman said. “Some sweeteners can also change the makeup of your gut bacteria, which might affect metabolism and inflammation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without sugar, diet soda is acidic, so it’s possible that it can erode teeth. In addition to this, you have to consider how caffeine can affect your daily life. “Caffeine can cause jitters, headaches or sleep problems,” Rissetto said. “Some people get bloating or stomach discomfort from the carbonation or the sweeteners themselves. In certain people, it can increase cravings for sweet foods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Florida's iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps within months with no chance for recovery once ill. Lethal bronzing is caused by a bacteria spread by a rice-sized insect. It has gone from a small infestation on Florida's Gulf Coast to a statewide problem in a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 hoaNsR"&gt; (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Instead, any tree properly diagnosed with LBD should be immediately removed to mitigate the chance that treehoppers spread the disease to other trees. Nearby palm trees should also be tested to ensure they don’t carry LBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;This was the case last month after Clearwater’s Coachman Park was forced to remove several of its palm trees after they became infected with LBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“The good news (if you want to call it that) is that this disease cannot be spread by pruning tools, as is the case with other palm diseases,” Figart explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;To prevent infection, palm trees can be treated with doses of the antibiotic OTC, with repeated injections every three months. While effective, this treatment does create wounds in the trunk, which don’t heal in palm trees, Figart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Another option that hasn’t been as thoroughly studied is to use a pesticide called “imidacloprid” on the root area of the tree, which is effective in killing planthoppers, Figart continues. This helps owners avoid wounding the trunk, though it comes with another downside, as the pesticide is harmful to bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 dJmKfw hTYOfq full-width" aria-labelledby=":Rrfon9a:" id="DHTM77RKJ5C6NFMOBVMWUUTI7E"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 bCvYh imageWrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption id=":Rrfon9a:" class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 jOjMik"&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 ewwUYq"&gt;FILE - In this July 1, 2015 file photo, Marvin Hernandez, right, and Kelly Vera sit in the shade of a palm tree, in Key Biscayne, Fla.

"It started off as a third-leading cause and, in 2024, we see that it's not ranked at all, actually. So, it's still among the 15 leading causes, but not in the top 10."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sharonne Hayes, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, agreed that fewer cases of COVID-19 are likely driving the reduction in mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think there's a little less COVID, right? I mean, that's part of it," she told ABC News. "I think that the pandemic was such a time of both COVID-related deaths, but also just rising risk factors, particularly around cardiovascular disease, people's lifestyles were less healthy. And maybe we are coming back to more of where we are before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ahmad said another driver for the drop in deaths could be the decline in drug overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A CDC report published in May found that &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. drug overdose deaths fell by nearly 27% in 2024&lt;/a&gt; to the lowest levels seen in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Katie Schmitz, a visiting professor of medicine in the department of medicine and cancer epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told ABC News that leading causes of death continue to be cardiac disease and cancer-related deaths due to an aging population, as well as underlying factors such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schmitz noted that we have an increase in proportion of the population with these co-morbidities and it's important to highlight that access to health care can be limited, particularly for rural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Other leading causes of death in the report included stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also found that death rates decreased from 2023 to 2024 among all racial/ethnic groups.

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time obesity has overtaken &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/global-food-security/t-19020431"&gt;undernourishment&lt;/a&gt; as the leading form of malnutrition among children aged five to 19, according to the report released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, "when we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children," UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement on the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/obesity-exceeds-underweight-first-time-among-school-age-children-and-adolescents" title="External link — report's release."&gt;report's release.&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did the report say about undernourishment and obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of underweight children has dropped from nearly 13% to 9.2%, among 5- to 19-year olds, according to data collected in over 190 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, obesity rates have nearly tripled from 3% to 9.4% during the same period. The report suggests one in five children aged five to 19 years are overweight, totalling some 391 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "tipping point" was predicted by UNICEF back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions globally except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Many high-income countries continue to have high levels of obesity, including 27% of 5- to 19-year-olds in Chile, 21% in the US and 21% in the UAE, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Don't let obesity take you down" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Don't let obesity take you down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-67517715" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67517715" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/67517935_605.webp" data-duration="05:33"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is causing the rise in obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers at UNICEF, the rising trend of obesity is largely due to unhealthy food environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report warned that "ultra-processed and fast foods – high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives – are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children," Russell said in the statement. "Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children's growth, cognitive development and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To curb the rising trend of obesity, the report included suggestions such as improving the food environment by including food labelling, implementing food marketing restrictions and banning the provision or sale of ultra-processed and junk foods in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested firming up social protection programs to address income poverty and improve financial access to nutritious diets.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) can harm men's health in a trio of notable ways: through weight gain, through the disruption of natural hormones, and through a reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-concerning-link-between-semen-quality-and-obesity"&gt;sperm quality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study, led by a team from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, wanted to see if the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;processed nature&lt;/a&gt; of food makes a difference to a person's health – even if calories and nutrients in a diet are kept the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of research has linked UPFs with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-no-safe-level-of-processed-meat-consumption"&gt;poor health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not always clear if this is because of how the food has been made, because of the ingredients that go into them, or because we tend to eat them in greater amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-packaging-is-shedding-microplastics-into-every-meal-study-reveals"&gt;Your Food Packaging Is Shedding Microplastics Into Every Meal, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were shocked by how many body functions were disrupted by ultra-processed foods, even in healthy young men," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/not-all-calories-are-equal-ultra-processed-foods-harm-mens-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Romain Barrès, from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term implications are alarming and highlight the need to revise nutritional guidelines to better protect against chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173363" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic.jpg" alt="Food graphic" class="wp-image-173363 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic-489x415.jpg 489w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic-600x509.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173363" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers compared unprocessed vs ultra-processed diets. (Preston et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers signed up 43 cisgender men aged between 20 and 35, who tried two different diets, with a three-month break in between. The two diets were matched by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-calories-do-you-need-to-cut-each-day-to-lose-weight"&gt;calories and nutrient&lt;/a&gt; intake, but one went heavy (77 percent of calories) on UPFs and the other was mostly (66 percent of calories) unprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the UPF diet, the men gained around a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of extra fat mass on average, while levels of a plastics-related pthalate chemical called cxMINP also rose a worrying amount: it's a substance that's known to interfere &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/er.2009-0002"&gt;with natural hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third negative effect of the UPF diet spotted by the researchers was a drop in testosterone levels and in the follicle-stimulating hormone that's crucial for sperm production. It's notable that sperm quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;has decreased worldwide&lt;/a&gt; as UPFs have become more widely eaten, and scientists have long suspected there might be a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that UPF consumption influences cardiometabolic and reproductive health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.004"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "Diets also caused a trend in the differential accumulation of contaminants in blood and seminal fluid"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs are characterized both by the synthetic ingredients included in them (which you wouldn't find on a grocery store shelf), and by the ways they are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;treated and manufactured&lt;/a&gt; on an industrial-scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their introduction into our diets has meant lower costs and longer shelf life for foods, as well as enhanced taste and flavors, but the evidence is rapidly mounting that they're pushing us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-5-days-of-junk-food-can-trigger-obesitys-hold-on-your-brain"&gt;towards obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;various cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-food-may-exacerbate-cognitive-decline-new-studies-show"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; – and they're &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-are-trashing-the-planet-scientists-warn"&gt;not great for the planet&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study uses a relatively small sample size over a short time period – and only involves men – it's more evidence that we need to rethink how many UPFs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-could-sabotage-weight-loss-even-on-a-healthy-diet"&gt;we're taking on board&lt;/a&gt;, and how healthier alternatives could be eaten instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results prove that ultra-processed foods harm our reproductive and metabolic health, even if they're not eaten in excess," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/not-all-calories-are-equal-ultra-processed-foods-harm-mens-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Jessica Preston, from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This indicates that it is the processed nature of these foods that makes them harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Even in poorer countries that is now a real concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Children are considered overweight when they are significantly heavier than a healthy weight for their age, sex and height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Obesity is a severe form of being overweight, and is linked to a higher risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Throughout childhood, good nutrition, including plenty of fruit, vegetables and protein, plays a vital role in growth, cognitive development and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But many traditional diets are being displaced by ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar, starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef executive director Catherine Russell says the challenges posed by obesity should not be under-estimated. She said it's "a growing concern" that can affect the health and development of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;1 in 10 are now obese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Undernutrition - which can manifest itself as wasting and stunting - remains a significant problem in the under-fives in many low and middle income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/reports/feeding-profit" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;latest data&lt;/a&gt; from Unicef - a study that draws on data from more than 190 countries - finds the prevalence of underweight children aged 5-19 has declined since 2000, from nearly 13% to 9.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Obesity rates however have increased from 3% to 9.4%, meaning that almost one in 10 children are now obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The number of overweight children - which includes those who are obese - has also increased to the extent that now 1 in five school-age children and adolescents are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That's roughly 391 million children across the globe, the study estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions of the world, except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The highest rates of obesity among children and young people are found in some of the Pacific Island states, including Niue (38%), the Cook Islands (37%), and Nauru (33%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But many high-income countries also face a serious obesity problem.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that supports immune function, and heart, bone, muscle and nerve health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D can be made in your body from sunlight, but it is also found in salmon, egg yolks and supplements. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much vitamin D can cause severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and kidney stones. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people supplement with vitamin D, especially during the colder months when it’s more difficult to get your daily dose from sunlight (since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your skin makes vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; with sufficient sunlight exposure). But can you take too much vitamin D? How do you know when it’s too much? And could you actually die from taking too much?

You may have noticed that some milks tend to be fortified with vitamin D. This is because vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, which is necessary to build strong bones. Vitamin D also supports muscle and nerve function, heart health and immunity.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight—but enough of your skin needs to be exposed and it needs to be for a long enough period. Even if you have enough skin exposure, certain things can shield your skin from absorbing enough sunlight, including pollution, sunscreen and melanin content (darker skin tends to not absorb sunlight as well as lighter skin, as darker skin provides protection from UV rays). Even what latitude you’re at and what season it is will influence your UV absorption and vitamin D production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Recommendations start at 25 mcg (1,000 IU) for newborns and go up to 100 mcg (4,000 IU) for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to note that these are recommended daily vitamin D intakes and include vitamin D from all sources—like food and beverages—not just supplements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun exposure for adequate vitamin D production might be less than you think. Research suggests you can get enough vitamin D by exposing your arms and legs to sunlight (without clothing or sunscreen) at midday (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) for 5 to 30 minutes at least twice a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides sunlight and supplements, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058503/vitamin-d-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D is also found in some foods&lt;/a&gt;. It naturally occurs in egg yolks, mushrooms that have been exposed to UV light, and fatty fish like salmon, tuna and sardines. Some foods are also fortified with vitamin D, including milk, cereal and juice. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-die-from-too-much-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Die from Too Much Vitamin D? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The short answer is yes, you can die from too much vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many cases of vitamin D toxicity start as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. In analyzing the data, researchers found that people who were deficient in vitamin D—or presumed to be deficient based on living in colder regions—took vitamin D supplements in doses that were higher than what is recommended. Or the dose they supplemented with, combined with foods containing vitamin D, put them over the limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Typically, this type of toxicity happens over time, as opposed to overdosing all at once with the vitamin. “Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D acts like a hormone, so an excess of it in your body can lead to other health problems, such as hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in your blood),” explains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/maria-laura-haddad-garcia/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, editorial manager, nutrition and news, at &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. “This buildup of vitamin D in your body may happen when you take very high doses of vitamin D for several months. Additionally, since vitamin D is fat-soluble, your body can't get rid of it like it does with water-soluble vitamins.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that vitamin D toxicity does not occur with sun exposure, as the body limits how much vitamin D it makes from UV light. With that said, too much sun exposure carries other risks, including sunburn and skin cancer, so it’s still important to take proper precautions to avoid these risks. Keep in mind, though, that for the body to produce enough vitamin D, you do need some sun exposure without sunscreen. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before vitamin D toxicity occurs, there are warning signs, these include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thirst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If it’s not caught in time, vitamin D toxicity can progress to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat and eventually, death. If you’re taking vitamin D and are experiencing any of the warning signs, it’s important to stop supplementing and see a health care professional. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a necessary nutrient for many functions in our bodies and for overall good health. And like anything else, too much of a good thing is too much. If you’re already supplementing with vitamin D or wondering if you should be, the surest way to know if you’re on target is to request bloodwork from a health care professional to see the status of your vitamin D level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the best way to get vitamin D is through &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sufficient safe sun exposure&lt;/a&gt; and foods that contain vitamin D. Egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish and fortified milk provide vitamin D plus a host of other nutrients that are necessary for good health. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7952410/spinach-mushroom-egg-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spinach, Mushroom &amp;amp; Egg Casserole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7894353/salmon-with-sun-dried-tomato-cream-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Salmon with Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce&lt;/a&gt; are a good place to start.

The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/09/2-massive-pharmacy-chains-limit-access-to-covid-vaccines-in-some-states-what-about-alabama.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;promoting access without a prescription&lt;/a&gt; in the state as recently as last week, when the democratic governors of Oregon, Washington and California &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/03/california-oregon-and-washington-to-launch-new-west-coast-health-alliance-to-uphold-scientific-integrity-in-public-health-as-trump-destroys-cdcs-credibility/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a ‚ÄúWest Coast Health Alliance‚Äù aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The state Board of Pharmacy on Friday said it would have more clarity for vaccine access rules after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meets on Sept. 18-19. That‚Äôs the first meeting since the FDA issued more restrictive annual guidance in August which limited the vaccine to people aged 65 or older or those with an underlying health condition that would risk severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Thibault did not respond to follow-up questions about the restrictions Friday, when the Capital Chronicle &lt;a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/09/05/oregon-gov-tina-kotek-weighs-standing-order-to-protect-covid-19-vaccine-pharmacy-access/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Gov. Tina Kotek is weighing a variety of options to safeguard COVID vaccine access at pharmacies. One option could be a standing order guaranteeing the vaccine to individuals age 6 months or older, similar to one issued in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;But in a statement Tuesday morning, Thibault said the company was shifting course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúAfter reviewing clarifying guidance issued last week, we‚Äôre only offering updated COVID-19 vaccinations to patients who present a prescription from an authorized prescriber,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs a result, appointments cannot currently be scheduled online in Oregon. Patients can walk in to any CVS Pharmacy location, present a prescription and receive the vaccination.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The new regulations from CVS bring it in line with guidance that has frustrated patients across the state. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy stressed Friday that it would require prescriptions for approval and await more information from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of which U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy removed all members in June. Kennedy is considering appointing critics of COVID-19 vaccines to the panel, the Washington Post &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/08/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Pediatrician and state Sen.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes around 70% of head and neck cancers in the United States, making it the most common cancer caused by the virus, with rates increasing each year. Unlike cervical cancers caused by HPV, there is no screening test for HPV-associated head and neck cancers. This means that patients are usually diagnosed after a tumor has grown to billions of cells in size, causing symptoms and spreading to lymph nodes. Screening methods that can detect these cancers much earlier could mean earlier treatment interventions for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/i&gt;, Mass General Brigham researchers show that a novel liquid biopsy tool they developed, called HPV-DeepSeek, can identify HPV-associated head and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neck+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neck cancer&lt;/a&gt; up to 10 years before symptoms appear. By catching cancers earlier with this novel test, patients may experience higher treatment success and require a less intense regimen, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows for the first time that we can accurately detect HPV-associated cancers in asymptomatic individuals many years before they are ever diagnosed with cancer," said lead study author Daniel L. Faden, MD, FACS, a head and neck surgical oncologist and principal investigator in the Mike Toth Head and Neck Cancer Research Center at Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the time patients enter our clinics with symptoms from the cancer, they require treatments that cause significant, lifelong side effects. We hope tools like HPV-DeepSeek will allow us to catch these cancers at their very earliest stages, which ultimately can improve patient outcomes and quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HPV-DeepSeek uses whole-genome sequencing to detect microscopic fragments of HPV DNA that have broken off from a tumor and entered the bloodstream. &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-05-liquid-biopsy-blood-superior-sensitivity.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; from this team showed the test could achieve 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity for diagnosing cancer at the first time of presentation to a clinic, outperforming current testing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPV-DeepSeek detected HPV tumor DNA in 22 out of 28 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from patients who later developed the cancer, whereas all 28 control samples tested negative, indicating that the test is highly specific. The test was better able to detect HPV DNA in blood samples that were collected closer to the time of the patients' diagnosis, and the earliest positive result was for a blood sample collected 7.8 years prior to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, the researchers were able to improve the test's power so that it accurately identified 27 out of 28 cancer cases, including samples collected up to 10 years prior to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are now validating these findings in a second blinded study using hundreds of samples collected as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) at the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this differs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/amit-jain" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Amit Jain&lt;/a&gt;, minimally-invasive spine surgery chief in the department of orthopaedic surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, noted that “good posture results in reduced wear and tear of the spine.” &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/08/getting-it-straight#:~:text=The%20foundation%20of%20good%20posture,are%20either%20overweight%20or%20obese." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, slouching can cause your spine to become more fragile and make it more prone to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While good posture doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t develop back issues one day, having good spinal strength could help you better manage if you do have to deal with these conditions in the future, Mallozzi added. Your muscles will have to work harder if your posture results in an uneven distribution of weight or an unfair strain on your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people who droop their necks to look at their phones or other handheld devices often suffer from “text neck,” which creates additional strain on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciara Cappo, a chiropractor in California, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/text-neck-treatment#TOC_TITLE_HDR_1" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told Healthline&lt;/a&gt; that “the human head weighs 10 pounds. For every inch your head is tilted forward, the weight your neck has to carry doubles.” So, that hunched over texting posture is certainly not doing your neck muscles any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But standing up straight may not fix any health problems, either. It also won’t necessarily save you from any existing back issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is very little, if any, evidence to support posture and either reduction in current pain or prevention of future pain,” Queralt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Queralt &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444448/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;pointed to a study&lt;/a&gt; that notes that “the practice of generic public health messages to sit up straight to prevent neck pain needs rethinking,” and found that slumped posture in teenagers resulted in less neck pain in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, should I not care about ‘good posture’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

After all, you’re more likely to be attracted to and want to be around somebody you can relate to. But research now shows that these are far from the only characteristics spouses share. A new study concluded that spouses may actually pass mental health issues back and forth to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health issues are, of course, not contagious in the traditional sense. But research suggested that spouses can sort of infect each other with them. A team of 19 researchers from across the globe discovered this “spousal correlation” across nine different mental health conditions. If one spouse developed the condition, the other was more likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing a mental health condition after your spouse is diagnosed is no coincidence.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international researchers published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;. David Nield reported on the study for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why" rel="nofollow"&gt;Science Alert&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that this kind of “spousal correlation” is not unusual among things like religious and political beliefs. Researchers now believe that this correlation extends to things we don’t really have control over, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/spouses-can-infect-each-other-mental-health-issues-according-research-husband-wife.png" alt="happy husband and wife" title="Spouses Can Infect Each Other With Mental Health Issues, According To Research" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;RDNE Stock project | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied five million pairs of Taiwanese spouses and examined their mental health characteristics. They were then compared to pairs from the Danish and Swedish national registries. The researchers discovered that the couples had a lot in common, including their mental health. “We found that a majority of psychiatric disorders have consistent spousal correlations across nations and over generations, indicating their importance in the population dynamics of psychiatric disorders,” they explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nield identified the mental health issues that researchers found were subject to spousal correlation as ADHD, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, schizophrenia, and substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/type-people-hate-depends-how-smart-you-are"&gt;The Type Of People You Hate Depends On How Smart You Are, Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apparently, there are three reasons for the spousal correlation of mental health issues.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fascinating to know that there is this connection between spouses for these nine conditions in particular, but it does cause one to wonder why such a correlation exists. Nield said it happens because we tend to pick partners who are similar to ourselves. The whole “opposites attract” thing may not be as likely as some people think. There are also certain factors that create limitations when picking a partner, like socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third reason is perhaps the easiest to predict. It’s the fact that you’re bound to become more similar to someone if you live in the same environment with them. Researchers were unable to determine which of the three reasons was the most important or influential factor, as they all played a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these conclusions could turn what we know about human coupling on its head. It has long been believed to be random, but this causes one to wonder if that is really true. Additionally, studies like this one could help scientists determine why these conditions take root and what treatment would be best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/study-finds-70-percent-workers-engaging-private-activity-job"&gt;Study Finds 70% Of Workers Are Engaging In This Private Activity On The Job, Even When Most Would Rather Not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Previous research has examined whether or not mental health issues can be 'inherited' by posterity, but never really touched on spousal correlation.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group of researchers did find that children who had parents who each had a certain mental health condition were more likely to have it themselves. This isn’t the first research to present this idea. &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/patients-and-visitors/advances-consumers/issues/can-mental-illness-be-inherited" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jimmy N. Avari&lt;/a&gt;, an Attending Physician at New York-Presbyterian Westchester Behavioral Health Center, confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/spouses-can-infect-each-other-mental-health-issues-according-research-family.png" alt="husband and wife with their infant child" title="Spouses Can Infect Each Other With Mental Health Issues, According To Research" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Anna Shvets | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genes are clearly an important part of many psychiatric illnesses,” he said. “We know they are not everything, but they are significant across the board.” As an example, Avari noted that fraternal twins are more likely to both be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The risk is even higher for identical twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the idea that spouses can somehow pass mental health issues to each other is a new one, and it really has no basis in other research.

&lt;p&gt;Despite new federal limits on who can get a Covid-19 vaccine and the arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html"&gt;cold and flu season&lt;/a&gt;, many Vermonters can still get a booster, though details surrounding Medicare reimbursement and federal recommendations remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1960742897201872969"&gt;late August post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration approved Covid-19 booster shots, but only for those 65 and above or with existing health risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermont state officials are now awaiting a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which typically guides public health directives and insurers’ coverage, for those who want to get a fall booster shot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Really the best thing that I can recommend is either to go online and see if you can set up an online appointment (for a vaccine), or call pharmacies in your area to see if they’re available,” said Julie Arel, the state’s interim commissioner of health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vermont, pharmacies are moving forward with administering the vaccine. Kinney Drugs and CVS have the updated Covid vaccines in stock. Pharmacies order directly from the manufacturer. Providers — doctors’ offices and other clinics — often get vaccines through the state, which is not yet able to order the vaccines from the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kinney Drugs’ spokesperson Alice Maggiore confirmed that the stores can administer the 2025-26 vaccines to people above 65 and individuals between 12 and 64 who attest to having one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;qualifying conditions, as outlined by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS is able to vaccinate anyone over 5 years old, who attests to eligibility under the same CDC’s preexisting conditions list, or anyone older than 65, according to a company executive, Amy Thibault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying risks outlined by the CDC range from asthma or a smoking history to mental health disorders, like depression obesity, or physical inactivity. Patients do not need a doctor’s prescription to confirm the underlying condition at Kinney or CVS, both spokespeople said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, insurers cover vaccines received in a pharmacy. Whether some private and government insurers will be able to cover the vaccines remains uncertain. Even if people can get the vaccine by walking into a pharmacy, it’s unclear if they will have to pay for it:  “It’s a little bit mind boggling,” Arel said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest private insurer, plans to continue to cover the vaccine for any member, at no cost and with no prior approval, said Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer. Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT intends to do so through 2026, as well. MVP, the state’s other private insurer selling plans on the marketplace, also does not anticipate changes in its vaccine coverage policy, said Elizabeth Boody, a spokesperson for the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What employer-sponsored insurers and providers like Tricare, the military health system, might be able to cover, is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65, it is likely that Medicare, which covers the same age group, will cover the vaccines. Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-medicare-isnt-covering-updated-covid-shots-yet-rcna229338?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20Daily%20Health%20Policy%20Report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9g4vn2FcKwK2WsToNz0QzZ0ZssBbpVDhNryCG8pTeBhrZFYwE0Syr0RfgZFirPeoe-lIhlOhk_WEcGHSn14AMaN8D8ow&amp;amp;_hsmi=379503873&amp;amp;utm_content=379503873&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally a Covid vaccine undergoes three steps for approval: First the FDA authorizes the new vaccines — &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontechs-comirnatyr-receives-us-fda-approval"&gt;which it did in August&lt;/a&gt;. Then a panel within the CDC called ACIP (short for Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) issues a recommendation on the vaccine. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19&lt;/a&gt;, to do so. This year many are holding their breath ahead of ACIP’s announcement, since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/26/kennedys-vaccine-panel-met-for-the-first-time-heres-what-to-know-00428461"&gt;gutted the panel and replaced it with many vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state is weighing whether and how it will need to break from that typical process, and is currently exploring what Vermont statute allows for breaking with that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is quite common for providers to prescribe a drug &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label"&gt;outside of what the FDA has authorized them for&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not typical, however, for that to happen with vaccines. The FDA’s lack of formal guidance on what qualifies as an underlying condition leaves room for interpretation surrounding who qualifies for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s some flexibility in there, but because it’s not as clear as usual, there is going to be hesitancy, in all likelihood,” said Arel. “And anytime there’s hesitancy, anytime there’s confusion, it’s going to lead to lower immunization rates. We really want to try to avoid that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health is also looking to Vermont’s neighbors in the Northeast for direction, Arel said. In August, the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/28/with-cdc-in-chaos-vermont-joins-regional-coalition-to-navigate-public-health-challenges/"&gt;department joined with other state health departments&lt;/a&gt; in the region to build a coalition ready to respond to shifts in federal guidance. Though the group has no unified recommendation, she says it’s something they are considering to help mediate the current disjunctive state of vaccine recommendations and approvals. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“If as a region, we can become more aligned, it helps people across the whole Northeast region to feel a level of confidence in their state public health department’s decisions and how we’re moving forward,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healy &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-announces-immediate-steps-to-ensure-vaccine-availability-in-massachusetts-amid-trump-rfk-rollbacks"&gt;required in-state insurance carriers to cover the vaccines&lt;/a&gt; recommended by the state’s Department of Public Health, even if they are outside of the federal recommendations. The state’s commissioner of public health also &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/standing-order-for-dispensing-and-administration-of-covid-19-vaccine-2025-2026"&gt;issued a standing order&lt;/a&gt; that allows pharmacists to issue Covid shots to anyone over the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Arel said Vermont is watching its neighbors and looking into where state statute might allow for potential action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Getting clarity and having a message be clear and simple, is going to be the most important thing we do,” Arel said. “Unfortunately, we are still working through all of that, but we are committed to finding our way through it and making it as simple and easy as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/cook-islands" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Childhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is growing international concern about the damaging &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/28/ultra-processed-food-32-harmful-effects-health-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health impacts of UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bbc35bb6-92a3-4a84-bd0e-184814a9f091" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi.

&lt;p&gt;Vermont’s Department of Health confirmed the state’s first-known human case of the mosquito-borne Jamestown Canyon virus. The disease has relatively mild symptoms, especially for young people who do not have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state began &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquitoes-vermont"&gt;monitoring mosquitoes for Jamestown Canyon Virus&lt;/a&gt; this year, after it was found in nearby states. The monitoring showed insects in Rutland, Marshfield and Whitingham all carried the disease. This human case, which was confirmed in a Sept. 8 lab test in a Windsor County patient, further confirms the presence of the virus in Vermont, according to Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a good indicator and reminder, just like anytime we find the virus in mosquitoes, to continue to take precautions against mosquito bites,” Kwit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes become infected when they bite animals — particularly deer — carrying the virus. They then spread it to other animals and people when they bite them. Humans are “dead end hosts,” meaning that the viral load people receive from an infected mosquito bite is too low to spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that many people with the virus never experience symptoms, while others can develop&lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/jamestown-canyon-virus"&gt; flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as fevers, headaches, chills and aches. People with compromised immune systems and older people are more at risk for more severe symptoms — for some, more serious disease could escalate to confusion and discoordination, stiffness and seizure. About half of people who do become symptomatic get hospitalized, according to the Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent infection is to prevent mosquito bites in the first place. The Department of Health recommends limiting time outside during dusk and dawn when the insects are most active, wearing long sleeves and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt;, and covering windows, doors, playpens and strollers with tight mosquito nets or screens. The department also advises people to clear any standing water that may accumulate in things like pots, buckets or children’s outdoor toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late summer, the risk for mosquito-borne illnesses increases, Kwit said, since there has been more time for the virus to circulate in hosts and mosquitoes. The risk remains — and the state plans to continue monitoring mosquitoes — until the first fall frost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state also tests the collected mosquito samples for &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/west-nile-virus"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/eastern-equine-encephalitis"&gt;Eastern equine encephalitis — or EEE — virus&lt;/a&gt;, as it has in years past. There have been no confirmed cases of either in a human this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re just learning about this virus, too,” Kwit said of Jamestown Canyon virus. “We’ve only just started actively testing for it in mosquitoes we collect in Vermont, so over time, we’ll get an understanding of where we’re finding it, as we’re gathering more evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

At this year's Oscars, actress Rachel Sennott said, 'Take that beta-blocker, girl. Swallow it down and lock in.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors and pharmacists told the Daily Mail that they are seeing more women asking for propranolol prescriptions than ever before in hopes of getting fast-acting anxiety relief without lasting side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jennifer Lee, a 37-year-old healthcare worker from Texas, told the Daily Mail propranolol has helped slow the physical symptoms of her panic disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the drug helps slow the 'physical manifestations of anxiety' like a racing heart and mounting blood pressure, calming the body's fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haiyan Wang, medical director and psychiatrist at Neuro Wellness Spa, told the Daily Mail: 'I see this constantly now. Young women are drawn to it because it works differently. Instead of targeting brain chemistry, it interrupts the physical feedback loop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your heart isn't pounding, your brain doesn't read the situation as dangerous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned that it is not going to replace selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and sedatives that rewire brain chemistry and hormone levels. It may work for a big speech, but it likely will not treat anxiety on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Parth Bhavasar, a family medicine physician and founder of TeleDirectMD, told the Daily Mail that while it makes the body feel calm, it doesn't address the underlying root cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It doesn't treat the anxiety per se, but it just blunts the physical manifestations of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;B&lt;span&gt;eta blockers, which blocks the effects of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are several types of beta blockers prescribed in the US, propranolol is one of the few that is fat soluble. That means it is stored in the body's fatty tissues - where it also dissolves - rather than liquid sources like the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood-brain barrier is covered by protective cells with fat-rich membranes, so fat  soluble medications like propranolol can more easily pass through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gaby Cora, a psychiatrist and CEO at CoraLG, Inc, in Miami, told the Daily Mail she has prescribed propranolol for musicians to alleviate anxious tremors before they step on stage and academics before tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've been prescribing beta blockers for anxiety for decades,' she said. 'They work!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Propranolol, pictured here, is prescribed to about 10 million Americans a year, mainly for high blood pressure and other heart issues (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert Downey Jr made headlines during his 2024 Golden Globes acceptance speech (pictured here) for revealing he took a beta-blocker beforehand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taylor Love Peterson of Nashville said in a recent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a8046530-8db6-11f0-92a7-71f500ea6e44"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; video that she started taking the drug 'on an as-needed basis... And oh my gosh, this has helped me so much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Love Peterson said she has had no side effects from taking the drug once or twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas-based healthcare worker Jennifer Lee, 37, received a recommendation for the medication from her psychiatrist. It was meant to treat her panic disorder, poor impulse control and social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee also takes diazepam, a benzodiazepine that increases the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA, which inhibits and reduces nerve activity in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, since benzodiazepines can be highly addictive, she wanted to limit her diazepam usage by balancing it with something milder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee said she could feel propranolol's effects shortly after starting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from a 2025 study in Frontiers in Medicine shows the top reasons medical and dental students gave for taking propranolol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I definitely could feel my overall atmosphere start to get stable,' she said. 'My vitals stabilized, my heartbeat slowed down in a good way. [I was] feeling relaxed without feeling high.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee said she doesn't worry about physical dependence, abuse or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Propranolol use has become particularly widespread among younger women, who see its effects more noticeably than men do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bhavasar said this might be because women tend to have smaller hearts than men, so they generally need to work harder to pump the same amount of blood, increasing heart rate. Estrogen also increases the heart's sensitivity to adrenaline and quickens pulse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Love Peterson, pictured here, said in a recent TikTok video that she takes propranolol before big events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lee, pictured here, told the Daily Mail that for her, propranolol 'is a very healthy alternative to a benzo'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended dose ranges from 10 to 40 milligrams, which should be taken 30 minutes to an hour before a planned stressor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The benefits are clear: relief without sedation or addiction potential. You can think straight and use it only when needed,' Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I prescribe it for someone's presentation nerves, I know what to expect. The timing works well. It lasts about 3 to 4 hours, perfect for getting through specific situations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she stressed that it could lead to disastrous consequences for certain groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see young women not thinking about birth control interactions, athletes not realizing it'll hurt their performance,' Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone thinking about this needs proper medical evaluation first, then heart function [tests], lung function [tests], the works, not just grabbing pills from a friend.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication can reduce blood pressure and heart rate in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've had patients faint, get dizzy, worse. If you stop suddenly after regular use, blood pressure can spike dangerously.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warned that people with heart conditions like heart failure or slow heart rates could be in particular danger, and people with uncontrolled asthma 'should never touch this' due to the risks of bronchospasms and worsening breathing issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women should also consult with a doctor before trying to take propranolol, as it can cross into the placenta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 22:11:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQZ1RPZGZQWEp1RS1Wa2oydUFob0Y0Q2NRamtXYlYtU29mbHNMbGtTc1Q0WDdlZ0cyeTZGOHF6OWd5XzI4RFNHSS1MQWxCcnpXYXBUdmM5aXQ2SGd1c2V1MEZoTWdGYlBSNzBKRlRIT3pCZlBLNk1XTVBwWExjYUR6VDVkMjNOSC1ZWjhrY0RoWTVQSmlXdVFUUUpCSQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. ALLY关于疫苗和慢性病的“吸烟枪”研究存在根本缺陷- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/aaron-siri-smoking-gun-vaccine-chronic-disease-study-flaws/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Aaron Siri, personal lawyer and close adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., presented his “smoking gun” at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing on vaccine science. Siri, who has represented Kennedy in multiple lawsuits against federal health agencies and reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;helped interview candidates for Department of Health and Human Services positions&lt;/a&gt;, unveiled a study riddled with the exact flaws that peer review is designed to catch: fundamental study design errors, statistical impossibilities inconsistent with known prevalence, and results that collapse under routine epidemiologic scrutiny. Notably, even this study’s own data showed no association between vaccines and autism, the condition most frequently cited by vaccine critics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, known as the Henry Ford Health system analysis, was completed years ago and remains unpublished. It purports to show that vaccinated children have dramatically higher rates of chronic conditions than unvaccinated children. That it remains unpublished isn’t suppression, as Siri alleged, but rather quality control. The bitter irony of this hearing’s title — “How the Corruption of Science Has Impacted Public Perception” — is that, as I testified to the subcommittee, the real corruption on display isn’t in journals rejecting flawed studies. It’s in bypassing peer review entirely, shopping for any analysis that supports predetermined conclusions, then presenting it as evidence on a Senate stage. The analysis contains fundamental mistakes that any credible journal would flag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most glaring problem is detection bias, which occurs when one group gets examined more frequently than another, leading to more diagnoses regardless of actual disease rates. In the Henry Ford data, vaccinated children had substantially more health care visits than unvaccinated children. Conditions requiring clinical evaluation to diagnose — ADHD, learning disorders, speech delays, ear infections — will inevitably be recorded more often in the frequently seen group. Yet the authors never correct for this gap. Their only check was to drop children who never had a single encounter with a health care provider, which still leaves one group averaging seven visits a year and the other averaging two. That doesn’t level the playing field; it simply bakes the bias into the results. What they’re measuring is exposure to medical observation, not the effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take the claim of a six- to eight-fold increase in ear infections among vaccinated children. This is medically implausible but perfectly explained by detection bias. A child who rarely sees a clinician won’t have “otitis media” coded in their record, even if they’ve had ear pain. While untreated ear infections can resolve on their own, they subject children to unnecessary pain, potential hearing damage, and risk of complications like mastoiditis or meningitis. The study repeatedly conflates absence of diagnosis with absence of disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The statistical red flags accumulate. The authors report near-zero cases of common conditions like ADHD and learning disabilities among thousands of unvaccinated children. Data show these conditions affect roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4473855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334291/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;9%&lt;/a&gt; of children, respectively. Finding essentially none suggests these conditions went undiagnosed and unrecorded in children who rarely saw doctors. In several categories, hazard ratios can’t even be calculated because all cases occur in the vaccinated group — exactly what happens when diagnoses are missed in the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real vaccine adverse events do exist, and surveillance systems successfully detect them: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26452420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anaphylaxis at roughly 1.3 per million doses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/66675/WHO_V-B_00.36_eng.pdf;jsessionid=8B06B71D54A3119648F061BA34612A07?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;febrile seizures after MMR vaccine at approximately 333 per million doses&lt;/a&gt;. A system that can detect signals at these magnitudes while filtering out spurious ones is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Properly conducted vaccinated-versus-unvaccinated comparisons look very different from the Henry Ford analysis. A 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14006367" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meta-analysis of more than 1.25 million children&lt;/a&gt; published in Vaccine found no link between vaccines and autism. Denmark’s &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nationwide registry studies&lt;/a&gt; found no association with Type 1 diabetes or autism. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed these findings&lt;/a&gt;. Germany’s nationally representative &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057555/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;KiGGS study&lt;/a&gt; of 13,453 children, including 94 completely unvaccinated, found no meaningful differences in chronic conditions when appropriate methods were used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If one accepts the Henry Ford paper’s methodology, you’d also have to accept its finding of no link to autism. You can’t declare a study definitive when it seems to support your views and suddenly invalid where it doesn’t. That would be selective interpretation, not science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elevating an unpublished, methodologically flawed analysis on a Senate stage has real consequences. The irony is striking: witnesses claiming that vaccine science has been corrupted present as evidence a study with detection bias so fundamental that any epidemiology student would catch it. If the scientific establishment truly were suppressing data, they’d presumably choose something more sophisticated than failing to publish work that confuses health care visits with actual illness. This undermines evidence-based policymaking, confuses parents trying to make informed decisions, and distracts from work that actually improves vaccine safety: investing in surveillance systems, funding research to identify those at higher risk of adverse events, and communicating transparently about trade-offs. When Congress elevates unpublished analyses while dismissing peer-reviewed evidence, it sets a dangerous precedent for how science is weighed in policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents deserve better than political theater. They deserve a system that acknowledges real risks, quantifies them honestly, and updates guidance as data accumulate. They deserve policymakers who can distinguish between methodologically sound analyses and those with fatal flaws. And they deserve to know that the overwhelming body of high-quality research, using proper controls and accounting for health care utilization, finds no increased risk of chronic conditions from routine childhood vaccination, even as we continue studying safety and improving our systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When public health policy is shaped by studies that can’t distinguish health care utilization from health outcomes, we all lose. The science on vaccine safety remains imperfect and incomplete, but substituting unpublished analyses with fundamental errors for peer-reviewed evidence won’t make children safer. It will only make parents less certain about whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study cautions high levels of cannabis use could harm chances of falling &lt;/span&gt;pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing 1,059 samples of follicular fluid from around the developing eggs of patients undergoing IVF treatments, University of Toronto embryologist Cyntia Duval and colleagues found 62 that were positive for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; (THC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immature egg cells (oocytes) from fluids with higher levels of THC were more like&lt;span&gt;ly to have chromosomal abnormalities. These oocytes also tended to mature at faster rates than the matched controls that had no traces of THC in their surrounding follicular fluid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-cannabis-lower-sperm-quality-new-study-reveals-a-surprise-result"&gt;Does Cannabis Lower Sperm Quality? New Study Reveals a Surprise Result&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The study suggests that consumption of cannabis might affect the outcome of IVF," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabis-use-may-impact-female-fertility"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Mark Connor from Macquarie University, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The work did not address the potential effects of cannabis consumption on natural conception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Duval and her team then tested the eggs from 24 consenting patients. The experiments echoed their previous findings, with unfertilized eggs exposed to THC concentrations above the previous experiment's average featuring nearly 10 percent more chromosome errors and maturing faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the sample size is small, other fertility-impacting factors – such as the patient's age – could not be controlled for, the researchers caution. Today, age is the single largest risk factor for reduced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovum_quality"&gt;egg quality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For women considering or undergoing fertility treatment, this research suggests that cannabis use may compromise reproductive outcomes – not by preventing fertilization, but by reducing the likelihood of producing chromosomally normal embryos," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabis-use-may-impact-female-fertility"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; obstetrician and gynecologist Alex Polyakov from the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since embryo euploidy is closely linked to successful implantation and healthy pregnancy, cannabis exposure could prolong the time to conception and increase the risk of IVF failure and miscarriage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/ftox.2021.647918"&gt;&lt;span&gt;animal studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have shown THC exposure negatively impacts embryo development, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2025.02.008"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in humans have found moderate links between regular cannabis use and infertility, prompting a need for further investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the use of medical and recreational cannabis is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/93-of-patients-prefer-cannabis-over-opioids-for-managing-their-pain-according-to-new-study"&gt;providing pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-experiment-confirms-the-best-cannabis-compound-for-anxiety"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; relief for a growing number of people around the world, it still comes with considerable health concerns, including loss of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-study-yet-on-cannabis-and-brain-function-finds-a-worrying-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;working memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and an increased risk of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-linked-to-2x-risk-of-heart-disease-death-scientists-discover"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its use during pregnancy &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/using-cbd-and-thc-during-pregnancy-could-harm-developing-brains"&gt;is not advised&lt;/a&gt;, and without more evidence, abstaining during conception &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-associated-with-genetic-changes-in-baby-brains"&gt;is the safest choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173477" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EffectsOfCannabisHumanBodyInfographic-e1757375294681.png" alt="Cannabis Use Could Be Detrimental to Female Fertility" class="wp-image-173477 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173477" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.20119"&gt;Srinivasan et al., Cureus, 2021&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Past research has also linked cannabis use to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.20119"&gt;&lt;span&gt;problems with sperm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Long COVID was persistent when study follow-up was 1 or 2 years, but overall prevalence estimates varied widely across studies, ranging from 3% to 80% in studies published last year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among studies from North America, the estimated pooled prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24% to 38%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors associated with long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing risk factors, the three strongest for long COVID were being unvaccinated (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.81, meta-analyzed from 7 studies), infections from pre-Omicron variants (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.17, from 6 studies), and female sex (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.84, from 33 studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies that included only hospitalized patients found higher rates of long COVID than those who had patients with mild cases of the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two most commonly identified long-COVID symptoms were memory problems and muscle weakness, both with estimated prevalence of 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We caution that our pooled prevalence estimates represent the percentage of individuals who ever experienced long COVID symptoms during study follow-up, rather than those who are currently experiencing symptoms at a specific point in time, among those with a history of COVID infection," the authors said. "Therefore, our pooled estimates may overstate the clinical burden of long COVID."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower prevalence in teens at 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;US teens surveyed about long COVID in the summer of 2022 describe symptoms at 4 weeks post-infection that improved by 3 months post-infection, according to the second study.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys were given to 784 respondents ages 12 to 17. Of those participants, 264 (34%) said they had tested positive for COVID-19, 291 (37%) never tested positive, and 229 (29%) were never tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one symptom lasting 4 weeks or longer were reported by 41% of the positive respondents, compared to 12% of negative respondents and 11% of never-tested respondents. There was no association between COVID variant and odds of reporting lasting symptoms.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most symptoms resolved within three months, and less than 30% of adolescents reporting symptoms who tested positive reported their symptoms persisted for three or more months," the authors concluded.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a shared experience among most people: “When we’re kids, we’re constantly stressing our motor systems: running, climbing, falling, and trying new movements beyond our comfort zones,” explains longevity expert Bill Hanks, founder and CEO of Huemn. “This is how we develop balance and coordination. As adults, we stop doing all those things, and as a result, our motor skills naturally decline.” But although this is the case for most people, it doesn’t mean it has to be the case for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. As we get older, we can slow down this bodily and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.realsimple.com/age-brain-declines-study-11706222" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive deterioration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cognitive deterioration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who continue to challenge their bodies in consistent ways will maintain sharper balance and motion as they age,” Hanks says. And to truly put it to the test, we asked longevity experts for four simple challenges you can try (at home, of course) to see how well your body’s really aging and keep the momentum going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Happens to Our Bodies as We Age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the realities of aging is that our motor functions—strength, coordination, balance, and agility—tend to decline over time,” explains longevity expert Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, CEO of Optispan. “This isn’t just about muscles getting weaker. The nerves that carry signals to those muscles become less efficient, joints lose flexibility, and our sensory systems (such as vision, the inner ear, and even the body’s sense of position in space) all show wear and tear. Together, these changes can make reaction times slower and stumbles more likely.” While genetics and lifestyle habits vary from person to person, science has shown that we have more control over our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/preventative-health/habits-of-people-who-age-well" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt; than we might believe, Dr. Kaeberlein says. You can start by trying one—or all—of these simple challenges at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 Simple Challenges to Test Your Body’s Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;01 of 04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grip Strength Test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown grip strength to be a strong correlate to overall vitality, independence, and even longevity,” Hanks says. Here’s how to try it at home: place a firm grip on a jar lid and test how quickly you’re able to twist it off.

If you can do it while multitasking, your body’s in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;03 of 04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Test Your Strength&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle mass naturally tends to decline with age, while body fat can increase, which can impact strength, metabolism, and long-term health,” Hanks says.

Four measles cases have been confirmed among the attendees; none of them were vaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The health department said it is working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families and race participants of their possible exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The event was a competition for teen cyclists in the league’s region 6, whose teams come largely from southern Utah from St. George to Moab, and as far north as Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The Wasatch County School District issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying that none of the participants of the cycling event were Wasatch County residents. “There are no known measles cases in Wasatch County and the event was not connected to WCSD,” the district said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The new cases bring the state’s confirmed total to 24, according to the health department. Only one of those was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Even at outdoor events, measles remains highly contagious and can spread easily, Dr. Leisha Nolen, epidemiologist for the state of Utah, said in a statement issued by the health department. She urged anyone who attended&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the event to check their measles-mumps-rubella vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The MMR vaccine is 97% effective against measles when people receive two doses, according to the state’s health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah vaccination data among kindergarteners shows that despite the vaccine’s effectiveness, fewer and fewer students are receiving required vaccines as more parents seek exemptions for personal and religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;During the 2024-25 school year, 11.2% of all Utah kindergarteners — and 9.9% of in-person kindergarten students — were not adequately vaccinated for measles, according to state data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear one to two weeks after exposure, according to the health department. They include a moderate fever accompanying a cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. A few days later, the department said, the fever spikes to 101 degrees or higher and a rash appears along the hairline before spreading to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xaGxRWW5ST0NDNWxYY1lmS0xtblZsTnJJdUZNcmRtdlZnakJSZUgzOUNSY2I3NUhNYi1Zc0s0dTVkMGdscHlVRjhxaU00Wkk5ZzhKbGVCSjZVMHlDQ1NHSW80bTJla2xaRTZVT3g5em9UM05OdndCdndZemZ3QQ</guid></item><item><title>肮脏的习惯，仅12小时后就有6200万美国人与精神病有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15081421/Dirty-habit-followed-62million-Americans-linked-psychosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are warning that potent marijuana may lead to serious mental health issues, including schizophrenia and psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, cannabis use has nearly doubled in the past decade with 21.8 percent of individuals aged 12 years and older - 61.8 million people - reporting cannabis use in 2023, up from 12.6 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes one 'high' after consuming marijuana, has also increased in most strains. Today, THC content is around 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant rise from 1995, when the average batch of marijuana seized by the DEA had a THC content of four percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in some weed pens and vapes, THC can reach percentages in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new investigation, researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-7455a9e0-8d95-11f0-9a66-b10a4ba7e97f"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-74550da0-8d95-11f0-9a66-b10a4ba7e97f"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; looked at the effects of highly concentrated marijuana products containing at least 5mg THC or more than 10 percent of the chemical per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They reviewed data from 99 studies that included 221,097 cannabis users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two thirds (61 percent) of studies included participants aged 18 to 59, with 4 percent including adolescents. From their analysis, 70 percent of the studies showed an unfavorable link between cannabis products containing more than 10 percent of THC per serving and psychosis or schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts are warning how cannabis products containing high levels of THC have a high risk of triggering psychosis, following a new in-depth investigation (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cannabis is becoming easier to access and more potent. The graph refers to smokable cannabis. Other forms, such as vapes, contain up to 98 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical in the drug linked to psychosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The association with psychosis or schizophrenia was identified quickly, even during the first 12 hours of use and was present at follow-up of up to two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They did not mention how the frequency of cannabis use impacted the onset of mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Author of the study Dr Jonathan Samet, professor of epidemiology and environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health, said: 'The findings are concerning and warrant a precautionary approach to using cannabis products, particularly for those with preexisting psychosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most recent shocking cases of cannabis-induced psychosis which made headlines involved &lt;span&gt;Bryn Spejcher of Thousand Oaks, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-fd253260-92ea-11ee-8c85-ab4c6ecfd665" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, who picked up a bread knife and stabbed her new boyfriend 108 times - killing him - before turning the blade on her dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The then 32-year-old, who worked as an audiologist, then proceeded to stab herself - only stopping when police hit her nine times with a baton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2023,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12816729/Spejcher-CONVICTED-killing-boyfriend-stabbing-cannabis-psychosis.html"&gt; Spejcher was convicted of killing her boyfriend&lt;/a&gt; - Chad O'Melia, then 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, testimony from an expert witness called by the prosecution, seen exclusively by DailyMail.com, paints a vastly different picture of the perpetrator than the story would initially suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forensic psychiatrist and expert witness Dr Kris Mohandie told the jury that Spejcher was a 'normal' girl with 'no history of mental illness or violence' who was committed to 'doing good' in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That fateful night her brain was completely overtaken by extreme psychosis - induced by potent marijuana that had been supplied by her boyfriend, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In testimony from Spejcher herself, the healthcare professional said she'd smoked weed only a few times before, and had 'never been high'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her attack was launched because she had 'lost touch with reality', as the cannabis had triggered 'voices in her head'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a growing number of cases echoing Spejcher's, more studies have focused on the harmful impacts of potent cannabis, especially when it comes to mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The studies assessed in the recent investigation looked at people using cannabis both for recreational purposes and therapeutically. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medicinal marijuana is commonly used to treat various conditions such as chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also look at how cannabis impacted depression and anxiety, with mixed results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;32 year-old Bryn Spejcher was said to be suffering a severe case of cannabis-induced psychosis when she brutally murdered her boyfriend in May 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In nontherapeutic studies, participants reported worsening anxiety in 53 percent of the cases and depression in 41 percent of the investigations. Healthy participants - those with no underlying conditions - were the most prone to these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In therapeutic studies, looking at how cannabis helps treat medical conditions, patients experienced relief from anxiety and depression in half of the cases. Those with cancer and neurologic conditions experienced the most benefits for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found 75 percent of the studies were associated with users developing an addiction to the drug known as cannabis use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a mental health condition where a person compulsively uses cannabis despite experiencing significant impairment or distress in their daily life, leading to negative social, occupational, or health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As cannabis use has increased, the population prevalence of cannabis use disorder has risen in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2023, almost one third of those who reported using cannabis, met criteria for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several factors have contributed to this surge, experts say, including the decriminalization and legalization of recreational cannabis, and the increasing availability of cannabis products in legal markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-11645727/How-America-surrendered-marijuana-KAYLA-BRANTLEY-reveals-pot-ubiquitous-US.html"&gt;fully legal in 24 states&lt;/a&gt;, plus Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half of Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, and 79 percent live in a county with at least one dispensary, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/08/facts-about-marijuana/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent study comes of the back of another body of research that was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It revealed that patients needing hospitalization because of cannabis-related health problems were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Modes of marijuana use in 2023 among people aged 12 or older in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms could range from severe psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia or panic attacks to overdosing on THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that the risk for schizophrenia was 241 times higher among people needing hospitalization for cannabis-induced psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This temporary mental health condition triggered by cannabis use causes hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report found that the main cause of this major health risk was the significant rise in the levels of THC within cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa said: 'Cannabis from the 2000s is not the same as in 2025.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While schizophrenia itself is not a fatal condition, it can lead to life-threatening situations as these patients have a higher risk of dying by suicide due to severe symptoms such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the report revealed that about 0.47 percent of cannabis users end up experiencing symptoms of psychosis. That's roughly one in every 200 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 76 percent of those who do experience these symptoms for more than 24 hours end up needing emergency care - sending their chances of developing schizophrenia skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schizophrenia is treated with a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antipsychotic drugs, like risperidone and olanzapine can help manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions by balancing brain chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients cope with symptoms and improve their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:45:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>65岁以上精力充沛的人通常会发誓这7种爱好能让他们保持活力- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-people-over-65-who-stay-full-of-energy-usually-swear-by-these-7-hobbies-that-keep-them-moving/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="320" data-end="370"&gt;Getting older doesn’t have to mean slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="372" data-end="638"&gt;In fact, I’ve met people in their seventies and eighties who are more active and full of life than some folks in their forties. The difference? They don’t sit still for long. They’ve built movement into their everyday routines through hobbies they genuinely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="640" data-end="744"&gt;Here are seven that come up again and again when you ask energetic people over 65 how they keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="751" data-end="781"&gt;1. Walking with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="783" data-end="923"&gt;You might think walking is too simple to count, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s accessible, low-impact, and can be done almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="925" data-end="1137"&gt;The people I’ve seen turn walking into a hobby don’t just stroll aimlessly. They walk with intention—whether that’s exploring a new neighborhood, hiking a trail, or joining a walking group that makes it social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1139" data-end="1420"&gt;One man I know in his late seventies wakes up every morning, grabs his headphones, and sets out for a three-mile loop around his town. He treats it almost like meditation, syncing his steps with music or podcasts. It’s movement, yes, but also a daily ritual that keeps him sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1422" data-end="1688"&gt;As noted by the American Heart Association, regular walking &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/walking/every-step-counts?.com"&gt;improves cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, boosts mood, and even sharpens memory. And when older adults treat it as something to look forward to, not just “exercise,” it becomes the backbone of their energy routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1690" data-end="1830"&gt;Even small variations—changing routes, adding inclines, or walking with friends—turn this simple act into something surprisingly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1837" data-end="1852"&gt;2. Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1854" data-end="2001"&gt;I once stumbled into a salsa class while traveling in Mexico City. Half the class was over sixty, and they were outdancing the twenty-somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2003" data-end="2180"&gt;That’s the thing about dancing—it works because it blends fun with movement. There’s rhythm, community, and a sense of play that makes people forget they’re exercising at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2182" data-end="2506"&gt;And it’s not just about cardio. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020748921001723?.com"&gt;Dancing challenges coordination&lt;/a&gt; and balance, keeping the brain sharp with every step and turn. Studies back this up: dance improves memory, coordination, and neuroplasticity—and is even linked to lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2508" data-end="2770"&gt;I’ve also noticed that older adults who keep dancing tend to be more socially connected. Whether it’s ballroom, line dancing, or just grooving in the living room, it’s hard not to smile when you’re moving to music. And that joy is part of why it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2777" data-end="2794"&gt;3. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2796" data-end="2919"&gt;There’s something powerful about tending to plants. You bend, squat, lift, dig, and carry without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2921" data-end="3098"&gt;My grandmother used to say her roses kept her young. Looking back, I think she was right. Gardening gave her a daily reason to move, stretch, and stay outside in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3100" data-end="3359"&gt;What fascinates me is how holistic gardening really is. Physically, it’s like a light workout spread across hours. Psychologically, it reduces stress and provides a sense of purpose. And spiritually—if you want to go there—it’s grounding in a literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3361" data-end="3643"&gt;A growing body of research backs this up. A 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1142456/full?.com"&gt;horticultural therapy&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces depressive symptoms in older adults, especially when activities are participatory and conducted in care-providing settings over 4 to 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3645" data-end="3765"&gt;It’s not about having a perfect lawn. Even container gardens on a balcony or indoor plants can bring similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3772" data-end="3788"&gt;4. Swimming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3790" data-end="3888"&gt;If there’s a single activity that almost every energetic older person recommends, it’s swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3890" data-end="4007"&gt;Why? Because water takes the pressure off joints while still giving you resistance. It’s exercise without the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4009" data-end="4297"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another post, but I learned the value of swimming when I injured my knee a few years ago. It was the only thing that kept me moving pain-free. That same principle applies to people over 65—it allows them to stay active without worrying about wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4299" data-end="4462"&gt;One retired teacher I know swears by his morning laps. “The pool is the only place I feel completely free,” he told me. “It’s like the weight of age disappears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4464" data-end="4711"&gt;Many community centers offer senior swim hours or aqua aerobics, making it a social outlet as well. And let’s not forget: swimming works almost every muscle in the body while building cardiovascular endurance. It’s hard to beat that combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4718" data-end="4752"&gt;5. Practicing yoga or tai chi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4754" data-end="4899"&gt;“Stillness in movement, and movement in stillness.” That’s how a tai chi teacher once described it to me when I was visiting Beijing years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4901" data-end="5084"&gt;For older adults, practices like yoga and tai chi offer more than just flexibility. Tai chi, for instance, has been shown to significantly &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tai-chi-the-winner-at-warding-off-falls?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 58%&lt;/a&gt; compared to stretching—and improve balance, stability, and muscle reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5086" data-end="5285"&gt;Yoga, meanwhile, strengthens posture, flexibility, and mobility. A review of 33 randomized controlled studies found that &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/03/strong-evidence-that-yoga-protects-against-frailty-in-older-adults/?.com"&gt;yoga improves walking speed&lt;/a&gt;, leg strength, and other markers of frailty—hallmarks of sustained independence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5287" data-end="5537"&gt;I’ve seen seniors who’ve practiced yoga for decades hold poses with more grace and strength than younger people who only dabble in it. And they often say the mental benefits—reduced anxiety, clearer focus—are just as important as the physical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5539" data-end="5662"&gt;These practices prove that energy isn’t always about speed or intensity. Sometimes it’s about sustainability and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5669" data-end="5684"&gt;6. Cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5686" data-end="5840"&gt;Cycling isn’t just for young commuters in Lycra shorts. I’ve seen retirees in California cruising on e-bikes or pedaling along coastal trails with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5842" data-end="6068"&gt;What makes cycling powerful is that it gets the heart rate up while being relatively gentle on the joints. Traditional bikes build endurance, while e-bikes allow older riders to scale their effort depending on how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6070" data-end="6303"&gt;This combination of flexibility and freedom makes cycling an energy-boosting hobby that can be adapted as people age. And there’s something freeing about moving quickly under your own power—even if it’s with a little electric help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6305" data-end="6534"&gt;One couple in their seventies I met while traveling through Portugal told me cycling is what keeps their relationship strong. “We’ve ridden thousands of miles together,” the wife said. “It keeps us talking, keeps us exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6536" data-end="6639"&gt;That social and exploratory element makes cycling more than just exercise. It’s adventure at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6646" data-end="6668"&gt;7. Playing sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6670" data-end="6779"&gt;Pickleball, tennis, golf, even ping-pong—the specific sport doesn’t matter as much as the spirit behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6781" data-end="6982"&gt;Sports get people competing, laughing, and connecting. They provide structure (weekly games, friendly matches) that keep people accountable, and they engage muscles that don’t get used in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6984" data-end="7267"&gt;Pickleball in particular has exploded in popularity among retirees. It’s less demanding than tennis but still offers a fast-paced game that keeps reflexes sharp. And it’s accessible—many community centers have converted tennis courts to pickleball courts because demand is so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7269" data-end="7483"&gt;I’ve seen whole communities of retirees built around these games. They aren’t just exercising—they’re belonging to something bigger. And that sense of play might be the most underrated energy booster of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7485" data-end="7642"&gt;As psychologist Stuart Brown has said, “Play is not just an activity; it’s a state of mind that helps us stay resilient.” That’s doubly true in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7649" data-end="7669"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7671" data-end="7783"&gt;Staying full of energy after 65 isn’t about grinding away on a treadmill or following strict fitness regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7785" data-end="7920"&gt;It’s about choosing hobbies that feel joyful, that bring movement naturally into the day, and that connect body, mind, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7922" data-end="8028"&gt;The people who stay active later in life don’t think of it as “working out.” They think of it as living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8030" data-end="8137"&gt;So maybe the better question isn’t &lt;em data-start="8065" data-end="8093"&gt;which hobby should I pick?&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em data-start="8098" data-end="8135"&gt;which one makes me feel most alive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Several people were exposed to and infected with measles after attending an event at Soldier Hollow, the &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Utah Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt; confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 16, the Utah DHHS reported that approximately 2,000 people attended a Utah High School Cycling League event at Soldier Hollow. The department said it “has confirmed that several people were exposed to and infected with measles,” but did not disclose how many people, or the origin of the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events,” Dr. Leisha Nolen, epidemiologist for the State of Utah, said in a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nolen advised that attendees and participants of upcoming cycling league events check their MMR vaccination status to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said it is working to inform people of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah public health is working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of race participants who attended the Soldier Hollow event on August 16, 2025. We are also working collaboratively to help prevent spread at ongoing practices and upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah HHS said symptoms usually begin within one or two weeks after initial exposure. Those symptoms can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mild to moderate fever with a cough that later spikes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runny nose,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;red, watery eyes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blotchy rash appearing first along the hairline and behind the ears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department advised that if you develop symptoms, it’s important to protect others from exposure by staying away from other people and calling your healthcare provider before going to a clinic or hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

How relatively able are they to transmit? And [two], how lethal are they? How serious is the illness that they create, and the number of deaths?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on both SARS and MERS before COVID came along. [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SARS and MERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are severe coronavirus infections that predate COVID-19.] Those were two viruses that basically had the ability to kill 15% to 35% of the people that it infected, but they weren't nearly as infectious because they didn't have the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACE receptor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capacity. [SARS-CoV-2, in comparison, plugs into the ACE2 receptor on human cells.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then along comes COVID, which basically has this highly infectious characteristic but fortunately, the case-fatality rate and serious illness was substantially lower than what we saw with MERS and SARS. Just in the last six months, there's actually been the isolation of new coronaviruses from bats in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that actually have both [high infectiousness and high lethality] now. They actually have the ACE receptor capacity as well as that segment of the virus that was responsible for causing such severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So imagine a next pandemic where it's as infectious as COVID was, but instead of killing 1% to 2% of the people [it infected], it killed 15% to 35% of the people. That's exactly the example we're talking about with The Big One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true with influenza. You know, we've not seen a really severe influenza pandemic &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dating back to 1918&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, relative to what it could be. And clearly there are influenza pandemics there, in a sense, waiting to happen. In the future, someday, that could easily be similar to or worse than what we saw with 1918 flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we're trying to give people a sense that nobody's dismissing how severe COVID was, or what it did. It was devastating. But devastating with a "small d," not a "capital D," when you compare it to what could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="5ff90948-f751-478e-a622-4ef88c19f6ac"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Michael Osterholm, author of the book "The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics," warns that America is not prepared for the next pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of the University of Minnesota)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="db3e9cbf-b45a-4576-82c8-f14f12f71ef4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You mentioned both coronaviruses and influenza. Do you think the pathogen that sparks the next pandemic will belong to one of those groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;We refer to these as "viruses with wings" in our book — you have to have a "virus with wings" to really make it into the pandemic category. I don't think there's a bacteria right now that would fit that characteristic; it really is in the virus family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest likelihood is going to be an influenza [virus] or coronavirus. Sure, there could be a surprise infection that comes up, but it'll have to have characteristics like flu and coronavirus in the sense of respiratory transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Could you clarify what you mean by "virus with wings?" What gives a virus pandemic potential?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the things that made, for example, SARS and MERS easier to contain was for many of the [infected] individuals, they did not become highly infectious until after they're already clinically ill. But with COVID, we saw clearly a number of people who were actually infecting others when they were still asymptomatic, or they remained asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It [a "virus with wings"] has to have the airborne transmission capability, and that's the key one right there. … It would also be a virus that is novel to the society and that wouldn't have pre-existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You make the case in the book that you can't necessarily prevent a pandemic pathogen from taking off, but you can mitigate its harm. Why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think exactly why we give the reader the scenario, because you can see the conditions on the ground in Somalia. [&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Throughout "The Big One," the authors return to a thought experiment in which a pandemic virus emerges in Somalia and then spreads around the world, despite efforts by health officials to contain it.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every city, every camp, every clinic, every health care-related event is actually real. But you can see very quickly how a virus that emerged from an animal population — in this case camels — got into humans and how fast it moved around the world before anybody recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="71969cc9-4482-4ba6-80db-dfe5b554d5a4"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough [vaccine] for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e0ff69d0-f797-42db-b93a-b4f02b6eab39"&gt;These viruses are by nature highly infectious, and in a very mobile society, they are going to move. It just again illustrates that once that leaks out, it's out, it's gone. You can't unring a bell. Whereas other diseases that may be much slower to emerge and less likely to cause widespread transmission, you might be able to get to, but not easily with the pandemic. It's just gone. That's "wings," right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: And when you talk about mitigating pandemics, you make the point that governments must be involved, that industry can't do it alone. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Let me just say: I regret we didn't have six more months on this book. So many things have changed even from the time that the last manuscript went in at the end of last year and now, just because of what's happened in the Trump administration. We have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic. The office that normally did this work in the White House has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been totally disbanded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [that being the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy]. And there's no expertise there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if we had a major influenza pandemic and we needed vaccine, we'd be using the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embryonated chicken egg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only means we have for any large-volume production of vaccine. Novavax has a cell-based one, but it's very limited how much can be produced. Even with all the global capacity, we could only make enough vaccine in the first 12 to 18 months for about one-fourth of the world. So three-quarters of the world in the first year of the pandemic wouldn't even see a vaccine, and it would take several years more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House. HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] said no more, $500 million is down. The money had been given to Moderna to actually develop prototypes ready to go so that if we needed them, we wouldn't have to go through the long laborious process of getting them approved. We get them approved now with the strain change issue [left for when a pandemic virus emerges].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, that is like losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet [9,100 meters] — it's a devastating situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'These decisions were completely reckless': Funding cuts to mRNA vaccines will make America more vulnerable to pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="1206135f-df01-4c28-af6f-cf512132018d"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Government funding cuts to mRNA vaccine technology are like "losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet," Osterholm said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: SOPA Images via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c2b7ca87-15a3-4a31-a755-10dba3a1fd3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: To push the point on mRNA: Do you see its main advantage being the speed of vaccine production?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;What's important here with mRNA technology is in fact the speed, and you nailed that. Both in terms of not only designing the vaccine, but making it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing about it, though, is because of the way you can insert specific antigens into these vaccines [proteins that look foreign to the immune system]. You can take any one piece or several pieces, and actually now there's work going on on multiple antigens into mRNA vaccine, and that would be even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's much easier [than conventional vaccine manufacturing]. It's like a plug-and-play. Before, we didn't have anything like that. And clearly, we've demonstrated the mRNA approach does cause the human immune system to respond just as we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You also spend a lot of time in the book on the topic of communications — namely, how to better communicate key information in an unfolding pandemic. What do you think is a central takeaway for communicators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Science is not truth; science is the pursuit of truth. So expect that we're going to learn a lot over the course of time. And I wish I could say to you today what I'll know three years from now, but I'm not. So the best I can do is keep you informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I wrote an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;op-ed piece in the Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic response before lockdowns even got going and I urged not to do lockdowns. "They won't work, don't do them. When are you going to release the lockdown, because this is going to last for months to years?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I suggested was something more akin to a snow day. The most important thing we could do to minimize the number of severe illnesses and deaths was to keep our health care system functioning and to be able to provide that care. Well, we didn't do that well because we have these big bursts of cases. What if we had really had the data on hospital capacity in every community, and we put those numbers up every day? And when we approached, you know, 95% of beds full: "Please, just like we do for snow days, for the next week, if you can back off public interaction, we can get those bed numbers back down." We were in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should have done a much better job of communicating that and not just jumping to "lockdowns" because when they ended, then what the hell do you do? We didn't paint this as, "This is going to be a battle for potentially three or four years." We were approaching this far too much like a hurricane situation. "It's going to blow through, it's going to be horrible, but in six hours, 12 hours, we'll be able to get to recovery mode." This wasn't going to happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of things I find, throughout my 50 years in the business, is that people want truth. Don't sugarcoat things. At the same time, don't exaggerate; give people the reason as to how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Given how complicated our information ecosystem is now, I'm not sure if you have an impression of where most people got their updates? Or if it was highly mixed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that's a very important point. And I would say that no one's talking about having one single unified voice, because there's going to be differences when you're pursuing [solutions] and they'll change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where we needed more humility. I keep coming back to that word humility — to say what we know and what we don't know and how it could change. I think had we done that, we'd be in much better shape in terms of public credibility. When you don't know, say you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You close the book noting that you're often asked what the average person can do. Is there anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Actually this has come into sharper focus with regard to the vaccine issue right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our website, for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;when I do the podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we in the show notes list organizations that are working in the community on vaccines and to help support availability, education, etc. Get engaged with them. One of the things we didn't do is use our citizen public health army during the pandemic that we could have. There were some limited outreaches, for example, to the religious, to pastors and so forth, but I think we could do much, much more. Information will not stop the pandemic, but information may minimize the horrible impact that it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="05c9bcae-ba28-4f0d-bb2e-10eb96132bb8"&gt;When I talk about citizen involvement, they can't go and make vaccines, but they can surely reach out to their elected officials. They can make sure that [harmful] policies are not being made at school boards, or at city councils or in state legislatures. We just had a bill introduced in Minnesota that's starting to get some legs to it, that would &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outlaw mRNA technology as a criminal activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Literally, if you gave a vaccine, you could go to prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having citizens be able to track this, maintain contact and be able to testify I think is really important. … We have to do more and more, to have citizen watch groups that are alerting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIP [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative aimed at safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S.] is a good example of this. One of the individuals who presented yesterday at our big meeting is a woman with three kids, who is a mother, a department chief, all these different things — I don't know which 29 hours a day she works, but she's amazing. I said to her, "You know, you've got to take some time off." And she said, "This is too important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what's giving me hope, you know. That's what we have to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5a8b052e-90a8-4b73-9824-3af034c4c713" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
