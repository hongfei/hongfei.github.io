But these can deteriorate rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle twitches and a weak grip are among the early signs of the condition, along with weakness in the leg or ankle, slurred speech and weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no cure and experts say a reliable method for diagnosing the devastating condition has remained elusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those diagnosed with MND typically live for two to four years after symptoms begin, but the researcher's findings suggest the disease may start over a decade before.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03890-6"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers collected blood samples from 281 patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—the most common form of motor neurone disease—and 258 participants from a healthy control population from the University of Turin and the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then identified a total of 2,886 proteins specific to ALS—which is called Lou' Gehrig's disease in the US—from the plasma samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using machine learning, the neurologists then cross referenced the proteins with blood samples taken from 137 patients with other neurologic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ALS or 'locked-in' syndrome can lead to paralysis and eventually death. The acclaimed scientist Stephen Hawking famously suffered from it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The model was also tested on 48 further samples from ALS patients, 42 healthy participants and 33 patients with other neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's crucial for patients and their families to be able to discern between ALS and other conditions for diagnostic clarity, prognostic understanding and eligibility to enroll into the appropriate clinical trials,' Prof Pantelyat explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 33 proteins were identified as a 'distinct molecular signature' for ALS which differentiated the degenerative disease from healthy individuals and other neurological disease such as dementia and Parkinson's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the proteins identified in the panel, such as the neurofilament light protein have already been linked with the disease, but the current study was able to identify 16 additional proteins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that when this model was combined with other clinical information about the patient, it was around 98 per cent effective when distinguishing ALS patients from healthy participants and those with other neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the 110 patients and healthy participants whose plasma samples were taken before symptom onset, the risk score generated by the model increased as time went on and the patients got closer to the normal symptom onset time frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were able to rule out ageing as a confounding factor as the association was not seen among healthy participants or those with other disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded that the protein panel could one serve as a biomarker for ALS similar to biomarkers seen in the early  detection of Alzheimer's years before symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This rare and incurable condition affects the brain and nerves, robbing sufferers of their ability to move, to eat and eventually breathe. Pictured, Rob Burrow in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers have since made their findings publicly available to encourage and advance biomarkers researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Pantelyat concluded: 'Fifteen years of cross-institutional collaboration went into this work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Large scale partnerships are the lifeblood of research. They're what will lead to effective diagnostics and ultimately effective treatments for devastating diseases like ALS.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MND was famously suffered by physicist Stephen Hawking and last year devastatingly claimed the life of Leeds Rhinos star Rob Burrow at just 41-years old after a four-and-a-half-year battle with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-bd9acb20-8a3a-11f0-b719-3fedb52411f8" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15068833/simple-blood-test-motor-neurone-disease-ALS.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT IS MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves called motor neurones. These cells gradually stop working over time. It's not known why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a close relative with motor neurone disease, or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia, can sometimes mean you're more likely to get it. But it doesn't run in families in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early symptoms can include weakness in your ankle or leg, like finding it hard to walk upstairs; slurred speech, finding it hard to swallow, a weak grip, and gradual weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you have these symptoms, you should see a GP. They will consider other possible conditions and can refer you to a specialist called a neurologist if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a close relative has motor neurone disease or frontotemporal dementia and you're worried you may be at risk of it, they may refer you to a genetic counsellor to talk about your risk and any tests you can have&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Source: &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Motor-neurone-disease/"&gt;NHS UK &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A rigorous new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.13481?guestAccessKey=f420494d-a51d-442c-9d7c-4d14dbbe1aae&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090425" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that a single dose of LSD can ease anxiety and depression for months.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study involved 198 adults with &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;generalized anxiety disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or GAD, a disabling form of anxiety that affects about one in 10 people over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Participants who got lower doses of LSD (25 or 50 micrograms) did no better than those who got a placebo. But people who received higher doses (100 or 200 micrograms) responded quickly, a team reports in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"By the next day, they were showing strong improvements," says &lt;a href="https://www.kadimanp.com/david-feifel/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. David Feifel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Kadima Neuropsyciatry Institute in San Diego, one of the 22 centers that participated in the study. "And those improvements held out all the way to the end of the study, which was 12 weeks."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's unclear whether some of the improvement was related to non-drug factors like the sensory environment in which people were treated, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Robin Carhart-Harris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a psychedelics researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The safety looks good, the tolerability looks good," he says, "but where is the depth of information about the way you delivered this product?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Carhart-Harris, like many scientists who study psychedelics, believes that successful treatment is more likely if a person has the right mindset when beginning a trip and if the trip occurs in a place with the right sensory environment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not your everyday anxiety&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder involves extreme worry or dread that interferes with a person's ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's characterized by continuous worry, inability to relax, and all the physical manifestations, racing heart rates and sweatiness," Feifel says. It's also frequently accompanied by depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Current antidepressant and antianxiety drugs are inadequate for about half of people diagnosed with GAD.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So 22 outpatient psychiatric research sites agreed to test a proprietary form of LSD called MM120, which comes from the company MindMed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug is not at all like Prozac or Zoloft, which are among the usual treatments for GAD.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is something that has a very, very distinct subjective experience," Feifel says, "what people might call a trip."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;MM120, like other versions of LSD, can alter a person's perceptions and cause them to see, hear, or feel things that aren't there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, participants were far more likely to improve if they received a dose of MM120 high enough to induce a psychedelic experience. The higher doses also were more likely to lift a person's depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Non-drug factors&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Psychedelic treatment often involves guides or therapists who help ensure that a patient's psychedelic experience is safe and effective. In addition, treatment centers often provide rooms with soft lighting, a naturalistic decor, and music or other sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But in this study, it's unclear whether these environmental factors played an important role in the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The sessions were overseen by two "dosing session monitors," who also provided an education session about the treatment. The sessions were conducted in a "private aesthetically pleasant room," the researchers say, and participants were offered "standardized music and eyeshades."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All of these factors could have contributed to the outcome, Carhart-Harris says, but it's hard to tell because they weren't specified in the study protocol and could have varied greatly from one center to another.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"To not say anything about music listening, for example, when it's been present in virtually 100% of the trials that have been published to date on psychedelic therapy, is an obvious omission," Carhart-Harris says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A psychedelic future&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new research represents an emerging trend in psychedelic research: bigger, more rigorous studies that are more likely to be supported by a pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Such studies are needed to get psychedelic drugs like LSD, MDMA and psilocybin approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Feifel says. And giving doctors access to approved psychedelics could "revolutionize treatment" of psychiatric conditions ranging from depression to PTSD and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Give it a couple of years and we'll be seeing drugs like psilocybin [and] magic mushrooms as medicines," Carhart-Harris says. "A whole mindset shift is going to happen around that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA seems open to that possibility. It has already given MM120 "breakthrough therapy" status, which is meant to speed up the evaluation of promising new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;MindMed, for its part, has already launched a pair of "phase 3" studies of MM120. The company expects to complete those trials in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            A new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is suspected of causing 15 deaths among 28 people with symptoms, the health ministry in the central African country said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00023b6nfxec3p1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the 16th outbreak of Ebola in Congo, and Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said the fatality rate, estimated at 53.6%, showed the gravity of the situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00033b6npu8cdegx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The confirmed case was of a 34-year-old pregnant woman in the locality of Boulapé, in southern Kasai province. Research on the suspected cases was ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00043b6ndtn8wg3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To date, the provisional report shows 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths, including 14 in Boulapé and 1 in Mweka, as well as four health care workers,” Kamba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00053b6ndewxady7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The suspected cases and deaths presented symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea and heavy bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00063b6n4dfdla19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The World Health Organization said it dispatched its experts alongside Congo’s Rapid Response Team to Kasai province to strengthen disease surveillance, treatment and infection prevention and control in health facilities. It is also delivering supplies including personal protective equipment, mobile laboratory equipment and medical supplies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00073b6n0qrmwk1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Congo has a stockpile of treatments and of the Ervebo Ebola vaccine, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00083b6n0mhu4myl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re acting with determination to rapidly halt the spread of the virus and protect communities,” said Dr. Mohamed Janabi, WHO regional director for Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6ihz6t00093b6nj78kekga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Ebola virus is highly contagious and can be contracted through bodily fluids such as vomit, blood, or semen. The disease it causes is a rare but severe — and often fatal — illness in people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s be honest—there are two kinds of garages in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ones that house Teslas, tool chests arranged like an art installation, and Peloton bikes that actually get used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then there’s the other kind. The kind many of us know all too well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where the car lives on the driveway (if it lives at all) and the garage has quietly morphed into a dusty museum of wishful thinking, half-finished projects, and items you swear you’ll get to "once things calm down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post isn’t about judgment. It’s about recognition. Because if your garage looks more like a liminal space between dreams and duty, chances are, you’re not alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are seven things that tend to show up in garages when money’s tight, space is precious, and emotional real estate is even more cluttered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Unused fitness equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bikes. They're not broken. They're just...waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At some point, there was an intention. Maybe a new year. Maybe a health scare. Maybe a Groupon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But somewhere between the resolve and the reality, life intervened. And now the elliptical is wedged between a box of Halloween decorations and a broken fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As noted by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/07/7-rich-habits-of-highly-successful-people.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;socio-economist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Randall Bell, “Those who exercised, even for 15 minutes a day, dominated statistically in every single measure of success”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The message is clear: movement matters. But for many lower-middle class families, it's not lack of desire. It's lack of bandwidth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Boxes of unopened kitchen gadgets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This one hits a little too close to home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my own garage, there’s a pristine air fryer, still in its box. Bought during a hopeful stretch when I convinced myself that healthy eating could be solved with countertop tech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The truth? We didn’t have counter space. Or time. Or the mental energy to figure out a new routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it joined the storage section, next to the barely-used bread maker and the set of mason jars still waiting to be filled with bulk-bin grains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's a small but telling pattern—investing in potential instead of practicality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Half-used paint cans and renovation leftovers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know the ones. The paint you meant to touch up the hallway with. The bag of grout from that ambitious-but-abandoned bathroom update. The sample tiles that didn’t make the cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of it whispers, "You were trying to improve things. You just ran out of steam."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And honestly? There’s no shame in that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/laughing-in-the-face-of-chaos-book/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughing in the Face of Chaos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Rudá Iandê reminds us, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we let go of the need to be perfect, we free ourselves to live fully—embracing the mess, complexity, and richness of a life that's delightfully real."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve mentioned this book before, but the insights hit especially hard when you’re standing in your garage, staring at the evidence of all the ways you tried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Old furniture that might be useful "one day"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chairs with one leg shorter than the rest. Dressers missing handles. Coffee tables too big for your current place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We keep them because they might be useful later. Or because we don’t want to add to the landfill. Or because we can’t quite afford to replace them if we change our minds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But often, the real reason is emotional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They represent an earlier version of us. The young couple starting out. The hand-me-downs from family. The hopeful “new place” we thought we’d upgrade to by now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where being lower-middle class hits you sideways. It’s not just about money. It’s about momentum. Or the lack of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Broken things you intend to fix&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A vacuum that needs a part. A toaster that stopped working. Toys with missing wheels. Electronics that might just need a new cord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fixing them would cost less than replacing them—but time and mental energy are scarce resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result? A pile of purgatory items. Not useful, not worthless, just waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And here’s where the science comes in: financial stress doesn’t just affect your budget. It affects your brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As noted by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/08/29/poor-concentration-poverty-reduces-brainpower-needed-navigating-other-areas-life#:~:text=Experiments%20showed%20that%20the%20impact,of%20an%20entire%20night's%20sleep."&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on cognitive load, financial pressure can impair decision-making just as much as sleep deprivation—dropping your cognitive function by the equivalent of 13 IQ points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not laziness. It’s overload.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sentimental stuff with nowhere else to go&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids' artwork. Old trophies. Boxes of photos. The wedding dress. Grandma’s quilt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re lower-middle class, you often don’t have an attic or a storage unit or a climate-controlled basement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the garage becomes the default memory vault.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even if the space isn’t ideal, we keep these things because we’re trying to hold on to something more valuable than stuff: identity, history, meaning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve learned this the hard way, after losing a few water-damaged boxes that held early family photos. I kept telling myself I’d scan them "soon." I never did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I’m a little more intentional about where and how I store the things that matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Stuff you were going to sell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ah yes. The classic "we’ll sell this on Craigslist" pile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It starts with good intentions. A baby swing, an unused TV, maybe some speakers from your college days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But life moves fast. And listing, photographing, replying to flaky buyers—it becomes another thing on the endless to-do list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the pile stays. And grows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, the middle class keeps shrinking. In fact, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/31/the-state-of-the-american-middle-class/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows, the middle class’s share of national income has dropped from 62% in 1970 to just 43% today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just about garages. It’s about the quiet erosion of upward mobility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bottom line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your garage is cluttered with the ghosts of intention, you’re not lazy. You’re likely just navigating the everyday tension between hope and survival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lower-middle class life isn’t about lack of ambition. It’s about limited capacity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But here’s the good news: recognizing the pattern is a first step toward rewriting it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And sometimes, clarity starts in the most unexpected places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like a garage full of forgotten items—each one telling a story you’re finally ready to hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Federal data released Friday, for example, shows COVID-19 is trending up in most states, with emergency department visits up among people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about summer viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much are colds and the flu circulating right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people seeking medical care for three key illnesses — COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV — is currently very low, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu is trending down and RSV has been steady. But COVID-19 is trending up in most states. Wastewater data from around the country estimates "moderate" COVID-19 activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC wastewater also shows the XFG variant — nicknamed "stratus" — is most common in the U.S. Stratus can cause a "razor blade" sore throat and is considered a "variant under monitoring" by the World Health Organization. The WHO said the variant is only marginally better at evading people's immune systems and vaccines still work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectation is that COVID-19 will eventually settle into a winter seasonal pattern like other coronaviruses, but the past few years have brought a late summer surge, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of California, Davis Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other viruses circulating this time of year include the one that causes "hand, foot and mouth" disease — which has symptoms similar to a cold, plus sores and rashes — and norovirus, sometimes called the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do viruses spread less in the summer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many viruses circulate seasonally, picking up as the weather cools in the fall and winter. So it's true that fewer people get stuffy noses and coughs in the summer — but cold weather itself does not cause colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just about seasonality. The other factor is our behavior, experts say. Nice weather means people are opening windows and gathering outside where it's harder for germs to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But respiratory viruses are still around. When the weather gets too hot and everyone heads inside for the air conditioning, doctors say they start seeing more sickness. In places where it gets really hot for a long time, summer can be cold season in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I grew up on the East Coast and everybody gets sick in the winter," said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, an emergency room doctor and Arizona State University researcher. "A lot of people get sick in the summer here. Why is that? Because you spend more time indoors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;With stratus spreading, should you get another COVID-19 booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are otherwise healthy, timing is a key consideration to getting any vaccine. You want to get it a few weeks before that big trip or wedding, if that's the reason for getting boosted, doctors say. But, for most people, it may be worth waiting until the fall in anticipation of winter cases of COVID-19 really ticking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to be fully protected at the time that it's most important for you," said Dr. Costi Sifri, of the University of Virginia Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at higher risk of complications should always talk with their doctor about what is best for them, Sifri added. Older adults and those with weak immune systems may need more boosters than others, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;A lot of people get sick in the summer (in Arizona). Why is that? Because you spend more time indoors.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Frank LoVecchio, Arizona State University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are more younger kids getting sick with COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the CDC noted emergency room visits among children younger than 4 were rising. That makes sense, Blumberg said, because many young kids are getting it for the first time or are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51320066" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt; that the shots would no longer be recommended for healthy kids, a decision that health experts have said lacks scientific basis. The American Academy of Pediatrics still endorses COVID-19 shots for children older than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can I lower my risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same things that help prevent colds, the flu and COVID any other time of the year work in the summer, doctors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend time outside when you can, wash your hands, wear a mask. And if you're sick, stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "&gt;&lt;span class="caption | margin_right_half"&gt;Charlie and his mom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit uppercase"&gt;handout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I appreciate that you say that talking about mental illness and suicide reduces their power, because I feel like the more we don’t discuss this, the more mysterious and shrouded in shame and power it is. What would you like parents to know about supporting someone who lost a child to suicide?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My confidence in every aspect of my life was shattered — things that I never questioned before: Can I write an email properly? Can I make the right decision about which food to eat for dinner? Everything becomes this moral dilemma: Should I stay in bed? Should I get up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The friends, family, and community who supported me found a way to validate me as a human, as a mom, as a friend. I have one friend who found a way in virtually every conversation we had to say: “You’re a good mom.” Because you don’t feel that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That validation helps you kind of sit upright a little bit, so you can take in the new world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The word “confidence” is interesting. And if you don’t mind, I’d like to unpack that a bit. Did you doubt yourself as a mom? Did you feel purposeless? Where did that lack of confidence come from?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As a mom, you know, we’ve got one job, and that’s to protect our kids. It doesn’t matter what your parenting philosophy is, or your personality, or your family situation. Job one that’s baked into us is: “Protect your child.” When your child dies by suicide, it feels like: Wow. You had one job, and boy, did you mess that up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I understand a lot more about suicide now, obviously, but that’s still, honestly, a little how I feel. There’s a desperation there that will never, ever go away: How could this have happened? If you can’t get that right, then how can you do anything else?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We hear constantly about how teens, especially, are more depressed, lonely, or isolated than ever, for a variety of reasons. I’m speaking now as a mom of a high-schooler: I worry when my son displays any sadness, even if it’s normal teenage hormonal stuff, that it’s a sign of something big and scary. Do you look back and think about warning signs? What’s the reflection process like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I’ve done forensics on his whole life, back to: “Gosh, he sucked his thumb. Did I take his lovey away from him too soon? He cried on his ninth birthday. What does that mean?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think it’s important to explain that, for me, and I think for anyone who has experienced deep loss or some sort of trauma or tragedy, the way you carry on is to figure out what story you can live with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; I realized it does no good to stay with all the questions that don’t have answers. What if I had made him stay home for the summer? What if I had insisted that he text me every morning when he was eating breakfast because I knew he wasn’t eating?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I’m not saying don’t go there; I’m saying: Don’t stay there. One thing that really hit me hard in the early days is that I am a professional communicator. Literally, people pay me to tell them how to speak and what to say, and my son was quiet about this really important part of his life. I hadn’t cultivated the ability in him to craft his story and to be honest about what he was going through and to ask for help. That’s never going to leave me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I mean that I thought his being quiet was charming. It certainly was his personality. But one of the many factors in his death, I think, was his inability to really express what was going on in his mind, and to even say, “I’m so overwhelmed, and I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t feel like myself, and I don’t know what to do about it.” I did try to have those conversations with him, and he would be like: “I’m fine. I’m fine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s a parent to do? I think a lot of teenagers, boys especially, will just say, “I’m fine.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There’s the hopeful answer, and there’s the very depressing answer. The hopeful answer is that I really think that having these hard conversations, particularly between parent and child, takes practice. It’s something I think we are culturally better at now than, say, when I was growing up or when my parents were growing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Having your kid find the courage to say, “I didn’t do well on that test,” or, “Such-and-such friend is mad at me and I don’t understand why” starts really young.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We can’t be afraid of hard, age-appropriate conversations. There are people who are experts in emotional resilience and child development. I’m not one of them, but I know it’s a pretty simple thing that we can do as parents, to make it safe and normal to have hard conversations, and so that by the time, if you’re concerned, it’s a little easier to say, “I need a little more information from you, because I know you say you’re fine, and maybe you are, but tell me more about why you’re spending so much time in your room, or why you haven’t talked to that friend in a while, or why you’re slowing down on this sport that you used to love.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You don’t have to be in a crisis situation in order to be a better communicator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you hope that readers will learn, both about Charlie but also about the larger message of going through this and carrying on?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think that the book is about trying to take the mystery out of suicide. Because suicide, suicidal thoughts, this brand of depression that killed my son, is extremely powerful. It took a life. Yet we give it more power by keeping it secret, by not talking about the cause of death or by not expressing the shame and the guilt of being left behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Their brain is sick, no different than if your heart is sick or your lungs are sick or your kidneys are sick. I really want to drive home that there’s an illness behind a suicide. One of the things I heard a lot in the early days was: What happened to him?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was sick. If someone had a heart attack, you wouldn’t say, “Well, what happened to him? How did this happen?” His heart broke; it shut down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;People want to pin a suicide to a bad conversation or that he must have been disappointed about the track of his life. I can’t speak for everybody, but particularly, I think for young people, it is an illness. It takes over them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who else was he, bigger than this disease? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was the youngest of three, with two older sisters. I had three kids in three years, which is its own form of mental illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was always really quiet, and he was an observer. His sisters would be running around, playing or screaming or crawling all over the furniture, and he would just be sitting there watching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He had a great sense of humor, one of these guys that would, out of nowhere, throw a zinger, or some really sharp observation. He was a great listener; he was the one that people turned to. He was the one people asked for advice, or went to talk to when they were having a hard time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was surrounded by great people, he had his crew, and they were really tight and good to each other. He did not show any signs of mental health struggles or stress in middle school or high school. Looking back, I probably could pinpoint some anxious moments, but I think they were pretty run of the mill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He went to the high school he wanted. He went to the college he wanted. He was pursuing the studies that he wanted. He was working and traveling and socializing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When he started to feel sick in his junior year of college, he was unmotivated, is what he said. I learned this later. He was kind of spacing out, and he was worn out. On the outside, he was operating fine. He wasn’t missing anything. He was doing well in school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But it was hard for him, and so he put himself into therapy on campus. He didn’t tell us; he wanted to handle it by himself. For context, I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life. His sisters have been in and out of therapy. This is not a secretive, off-topic subject in our house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was in therapy for several months, and then we got a call from a friend of his the spring of his junior year, who said Charlie had talked about harming himself. I couldn’t have been more surprised. I was absolutely shocked. I’d just seen him a few weeks before. Everything seemed fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I flew there overnight. I was there when the sun came up, got a hotel room across the street from where he lived in a group house, and I stayed there for a week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He completely let down his guard. He was very vulnerable. He cried. He said he was scared. He could not articulate what he was scared about. That’s when we learned he’d put himself in therapy. He’d called a crisis line on campus, and they helped him. He worked with his professors to make sure that he pushed some deadlines back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was like, “Charlie, if you need to stop and drop out right now, it’s OK. We’ll stand behind you. Nothing is more important than you being on steady ground.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And he said, “No; I want to finish.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;After about a week, I came home. We saw him several times, and we could tell he was struggling because he wasn’t eating. He was very thin. He didn’t look like he was sleeping much, but he was really trying hard, and he was seeing a therapist. He was talking about the future. He was making plans. He was out with friends. He was working, he was exercising. We were checking in on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was like: “We don’t have to get into a long, serious conversation every time we talk, but I need to check on you. I’m going to ask you questions. What’s going on in your head is between you and your therapist or someone that you trust. It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me, but I need to know how you’re doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He was an honest kid, and three weeks before he died, he was at home, and I had a little walk and talk with him, and I just said: “Tell me what’s going on. Where’s your head?” He said, “I think I’m doing well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But this is the depressing answer. This is the thing no one wants to hear. I hesitate to say it, but I have to say it: Depression can be bigger than any conversation you have. It lies to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The night before he died, he was out with friends. He was having a good time. They were staying up late into the middle of the night, and one of his friends was having a hard time, talking about some drama, and he said to her, “Whatever you’re feeling right now, it’s not going to last.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That shows you how fast and how strong these emotions, this depression, can be — how powerful those lies can be. He was giving someone advice that he could not see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What would you say to someone who might see their own child, potentially, in your story? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Keep talking. And as parents, as individuals, as institutions, as a society, remove every obstacle to getting help. For example, if your child has said, “OK, I think I’ll talk to a therapist,” and they’re normally an independent kid, don’t say, “Let me know when you set up the appointment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When you’re sick in your brain, something like researching, calling, setting up an appointment, finding insurance? Those are the very things you cannot do. Take those things out of their hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other way to remove obstacles is to realize that your kids aren’t always going to come to you, and if there’s someone that they trust, cultivate that trust regardless of who they are: if it’s their friend, another relative, a coach, a teacher. Moms want to carry it all, but sometimes we’re not the right person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any resources you’d like to point people to, besides your book?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://afsp.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://afsp.org/"&gt;The Foundation for Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt; has a lot. They’re great. There was a book that I read called “&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-grieving-brain-mary-frances-oconnor?variant=40425028747298" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-grieving-brain-mary-frances-oconnor?variant=40425028747298"&gt;The Grieving Brain&lt;/a&gt;” that came out right when I lost Charlie. It was a little scientific for me at that moment, but it did help me understand a different aspect of the grief itself, which was very helpful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And Anderson Cooper’s podcast [“All There Is”] came out right when Charlie died, and I’m telling you — it was so affirming. I go back and listen to episodes, and it’s so real and so honest. It helped me see that my path to healing was through being vulnerable, honest, and open. I can’t say enough about that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you or a loved one are having emotional distress or thoughts of suicide, call 988&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline"&gt;&lt;i&gt;connect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; with a lifeline specialist for support.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Known as Chagas disease, it is carried by the so-called “kissing bug,” a small insect that feeds around the face and leaves behind dangerous parasites. Now confirmed in dozens of states, including California, Texas, and Florida, Chagas is creeping into public awareness as more cases and the silent risks emerge. What’s more concerning? Without early detection and treatment, this condition can quietly damage the heart and digestive system and lead to fatal complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising threat across the US&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and carried by triatomine insects known as kissing bugs, has entered a new chapter in the United States. Once rare and primarily confined to Latin America, it’s now detected in at least 32 US states, with human cases confirmed in eight states, including California and Texas, and researchers urge classifying it as endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a CDC-backed study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases recommends updating Chagas’ status due to consistent local transmission, especially in the South. In Texas, more than 50 human cases were locally acquired between 2013 and 2023, and canine infection rates in some kennels hit 31%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife like opossums and raccoons help sustain the parasite in the environment. In California, particularly in Los Angeles and San Diego, kissing bugs carrying T. cruzi are increasingly common, raising alarm for possible spread to places like the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Chagas Disease, and why is it deadly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is a parasitic infection transmitted when kissing bug feces containing T. cruzi enter the body, often through skin contact or mucous membranes. These bugs usually bite around the face during sleep and then defecate near the wound, allowing the parasite to infiltrate the body, requiring just a scratch for entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early symptoms: What to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease unfolds in two phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acute Phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasting weeks or months, this phase is often mild or silent. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, rash, swollen eyelids (known as Romaña’s sign), body aches, headache, and digestive upset. Because these signs mimic common illnesses or don’t appear at all, many people may never realize they’ve been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic Phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Occurring decades later, chronic infection affects about 20-30% of individuals and can cause fatal heart complications like heart failure, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, as well as digestive tract issues like an enlarged esophagus or colon. In many cases, the first sign may be a life-threatening event like a heart attack or stroke, especially in individuals unaware of their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who’s at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the surge in this many states across the country, awareness regarding this particular disease remains extremely low. Even though roughly 300,000 people in the US are estimated to be infected, fewer than 2% know they carry the parasite. In Los Angeles County alone, around 45,000 cases are thought to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Risk factors include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in or near southern or rural regions where kissing bugs thrive, such as Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working or sleeping in poorly constructed buildings or outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact with wildlife reservoirs or pets that carry the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barriers to detection include low physician awareness, lack of routine screening, and the silent nature of early infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis and treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of Chagas disease involves blood tests to detect the parasite in the acute phase or to identify antibodies during chronic infection. Prompt testing is vital, especially if exposure is suspected and vague symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to treating the disease, it involves antiparasitic medications like benznidazole and nifurtimox. These are most effective early in the infection, achieving cure rates of up to 80-100% in acute or congenital cases. Efficacy drops in chronic infections, but treatment can still slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who develop serious heart or digestive issues, management may involve medications, pacemakers, or even heart transplantation, which can help patients live well post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention: How to stay safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no vaccine exists yet, public health officials recommend these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid contact with kissing bugs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seal cracks around doors and windows, maintain screens, and eliminate nearby debris or wild animal nests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Use vector control practices:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoke out bugs, use insecticides, and bed netting where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Screening and diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get tested if you live in risk areas, or if symptoms arise.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that beet juice may help lower blood pressure by altering your oral microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beets are rich in nitrates, known to influence blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other foods high in nitrates include spinach, celery, fennel and kale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is fairly common, and almost half of all adults in the U.S. have the condition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High blood pressure is defined as having a systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) greater than 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (the lower number in a blood pressure reading) greater than 80 mm Hg. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But just because hypertension is common doesn’t mean it’s benign. Having high blood pressure, especially when it’s not controlled, places you at a higher &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, both leading causes of death in the U.S. and globally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With hypertension being so common, researchers have been looking for practical ways to help people lower their blood pressure for years now, and that includes dietary methods. Some of that research has led to beets, which contain nitrates that may help lower blood pressure. While there is mounting evidence of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vegetables-for-better-blood-pressure-11782695" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beets’ connection to healthier blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, researchers are always digging deeper into the how and why of it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Case in point: Researchers from the University of Exeter in the UK wanted to know if &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/stroke-risk-bacteria-study-8785920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beet juice altered the oral microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, and if so, whether those changes have anything to do with changes in blood pressure. They published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited two groups of participants. An older group, consisting of 36 older adults, ages 65 to 80, and a younger group of 42 young adults, ages 18 to 30. All participants were considered healthy at baseline with normal blood pressure levels, though the older group’s blood pressures averaged higher than the younger group’s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were three two-week interventions for this study. Before and after each intervention, participants went to the lab to have their mouths swabbed so researchers could look at their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-habit-bad-for-gut-health-8786202" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oral microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;—the good and bad bacteria that live in our mouths. They also had bloodwork and blood pressure measurements taken. Between each intervention was a two-week “washout” period to allow the oral microbiome to return to each participant’s “normal.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the first intervention, participants were instructed to drink two &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-late-night-drink-for-high-blood-pressure-11776969" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;concentrated beet juice&lt;/a&gt; “shots” a day, one in the morning, one in the evening, for two weeks. Each shot was 70 ml of beet juice, which is about equal to just under ⅓ cup. For the second intervention, they did the same thing, but with a placebo beet juice that had been stripped of its natural nitrates—though participants were not aware of this. The third intervention involved participants swishing with an antiseptic mouthwash twice a day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959424/what-are-nitrates-are-they-bad-for-your-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beet juice with nitrates&lt;/a&gt; changed the oral microbiomes in both groups for the better, reducing harmful bacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria. But the changes in specific bacteria differed between groups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The older group experienced a reduction in potentially harmful bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Prevotella &lt;/em&gt;after drinking the nitrate-rich juice, and an increase in the growth of bacteria known to benefit health; these changes were more pronounced in the older compared to the younger group, and did not occur with the placebo juice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The older adults in this study had an average blood pressure of 126/80 at baseline, which was higher than the younger group’s average baseline blood pressure, but the older group’s baseline nitrite blood concentrations did not differ from the younger group’s. Yet, while the younger group saw no significant changes in blood pressure or in blood nitrite concentration throughout the study, the older group saw an average reduction in systolic blood pressure of 7 mm Hg, plus an increase in blood nitrite concentration. This amount of reduction in systolic blood pressure is clinically significant, which means that the benefits may extend to reducing other risks, including heart disease and stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with any study, there is a risk of researcher error and participant bias with reporting adherence, though these participants reported 100% adherence to the study protocol. This study was also funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Industrial Partnership Awards, which supports collaboration between academic research groups and industries. In this case, the collaboration might have been between the researchers and the company providing the beet juice. While this has the potential for introducing bias into the study and its results, this study does support previous research on beets and blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s the thing: We don’t typically eat foods in isolation, and your whole eating pattern matters more than singling out one food. That’s why these study authors mention the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s loaded with foods that naturally contain nitrates and a wealth of other essential nutrients. To get you started, we have several Mediterranean diet plans to choose from, including ones that support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

It's caused by a parasite carried by a group of blood-sucking insects commonly known as kissing bugs, because of their tendency to bite people around their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease typically unfolds in two phases, an immediate acute phase and a chronic phase that often occurs much later. During the acute phase, infected people often won’t have any symptoms. If they do, they’re usually mild and nonspecific, like headache, fever and muscle pain. During the chronic phase, which typically happens 10-30 years after the initial infection, the parasites can begin to do serious damage to the heart and digestive tract. About a third of patients develop significant cardiac disorders as a result. Another 10% deal with digestive or neurological problems, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 7 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with Chagas and the disease causes 10,000 deaths every year, the WHO says. Most cases are found in Central and South America, where kissing bugs are common. In 2016, researchers &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5154432/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that there were roughly 300,000 people in the U.S. dealing with chronic Chagas cases, but nearly all got the disease in another country before coming here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; released this month, a group of experts makes the case that we should consider the disease a serious health threat even to those who never leave the country. They identify eight states (California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas) with confirmed Chagas cases in humans caused by local transmission. This is ample reason to consider the disease to be endemic — meaning always present — in the U.S., they argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Acknowledging the endemicity of Chagas disease in the United States is crucial for achieving global health goals,” the authors write in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most states do not keep track of Chagas cases, so the actual number of infections in the country isn’t known, but the researchers say there are clues to suggest that the disease is much more prevalent than previously believed. The Texas state health department cataloged 51 locally transmitted cases of Chagas between 2013 and 2023. The state also tracked more than 400 cases in dogs during the same span. Infected dogs have been found in 22 other states and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, told the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/chagas-disease-long-considered-only-100000024.html" data-ylk="slk:Los Angeles Times;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; that the known cases of Chagas likely represent “just the tip of the iceberg” of the disease’s actual spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Species of kissing bugs known to spread Chagas have been located in 32 states, including every state in the southern half of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-you-need-to-know"&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, Chagas can be cured with antiparasitic medication if it’s caught early. However, treatments become less effective the longer someone has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured,” Dr. Salvador Hernandez, a cardiologist, told &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/chagas-disease-united-states-parasites/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NewsNation;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;. “The problem is, we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care, including organ transplants and surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once Chagas becomes chronic, it cannot be cured with medication, but the drugs can help slow down the onset of the most serious complications, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20356218" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, infected people may need a pacemaker, heart surgery or even a heart replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, which is transmitted by triatomid bugs. (Ed Reschke/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Identifying Chagas in its early stages is critical. Most of the symptoms that occur in the acute phase, if they show up at all, are common and easy to attribute to typical viruses like the flu or cold. They include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. There is one telltale symptom, however, known as &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7660534/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Romaña's sign;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Romaña's sign&lt;/a&gt; — a swelling of the eyelid that sometimes occurs when the parasite enters the body through the eye. Signs of chronic Chagas include heart problems and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dogs are also often asymptomatic in the acute phase, though they will sometimes present swollen lymph nodes, pale gums and stomach issues. During the chronic phase, dogs can exhibit heart problems, lethargy and a swollen belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In their study, the researchers make the case that categorizing Chagas as endemic will greatly improve our ability to “tackle this neglected disease that, as has been demonstrated, has never been exclusively tropical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 22:36:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPWWtTMXg3QnJNQ2RvMHVhYkVfcFpZc2djR1RfZ3g0Z2tCT1dvU215SjBqNWZMVlBuSnNBOU9UOXVBeDAzX2NmTDh0NC1VVW1hdy12VkZPWW1RcmlTcGM0RHVXd1h3QTkwTVVLSHI3Z1pIWVcyeEtSNXF0RUFneW1UU3JKN3V2aEVncmhlalBTendRaXVTZVdlVW00cXE5QXpHS0ZINmpVRHRTWFZGbzdHTC1PUTBkWG8wcXJCMTlpd3ZCVEs3S21LbklYTF9UZGhlbF9lRE5wWDZSM2JKcENCdmxjOXRRRk1ZOVhB</guid></item><item><title>简单的夜间仪式可以延迟或预防所有成年人的阿尔茨海默氏症- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/this-simple-nighttime-sleep-habit-could-delay-or-prevent-alzheimers-in-all-adults/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full night of deep sleep is not a luxury – it might be a shield. New research suggests that the right kind of sleep can help ward off memory trouble in people whose brains already show signs of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studied older adults with no diagnosed dementia and found something striking. When these adults spent more time in the deepest stage of sleep, their memory held up better even if amyloid deposits were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-amyloid-plaque"&gt;Understanding amyloid plaque&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked with Alzheimer’s disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/amyloid-plaque" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; are clumps of protein fragments, called amyloid-beta, that build up between nerve cells in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body produces and clears these protein fragments without a problem. But in Alzheimer’s, the cleanup process doesn’t keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fragments start sticking together, first in small clusters that may be toxic, and eventually in larger, sticky deposits known as plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These plaques interfere with how neurons communicate, almost like static on a phone line, and they can also trigger the brain’s immune cells to overreact, causing damaging inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists study amyloid because it seems to play a central role in the chain of events that leads to memory loss and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the tricky part: we still don’t know if amyloid plaques are the main cause of the disease or more like a byproduct of deeper problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-brain-waves-and-alzheimer-s"&gt;Sleep, brain waves, and Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked 62 cognitively healthy older adults and measured sleep and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; on the same timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure amyloid in the brain and monitored sleep with electroencephalography to capture brain waves overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep here means NREM slow-wave sleep, a stage marked by large, slow oscillations that help the brain reset. The team then gave participants a face-name memory task the next day and compared performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work comes from Matthew Walker and colleagues at the University of California, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. The project also examined whether sleep helped beyond other known cognitive reserve factors like education and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deep-sleep-resets-the-brain"&gt;Deep sleep resets the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep helps the brain tune synapses and prepare for new learning the next day. It also supports the transfer of fragile short-term memories into more stable long-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another piece that matters for Alzheimer’s biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, the brain’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/space-travel-alters-the-flow-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-in-the-brain/"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; ramps up clearance of waste proteins, including amyloid and tau, by moving cerebrospinal fluid through tiny channels that flush neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-findings-from-older-adult-brains"&gt;Findings from older adult brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people with similarly high amyloid levels, more deep sleep lined up with stronger next-day memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That link was specific to the deep, slow-wave part of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, not lighter sleep or REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory being dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer’s disease pathology,” said Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit appeared where it was needed most – in those carrying a higher amyloid burden. It also remained even after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, gray matter atrophy, education, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-sleep-higher-alzheimer-s-risk"&gt;Poor sleep, higher Alzheimer’s risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short sleep in older adults is linked to more amyloid and lower &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large analysis of more than 4,000 adults found a higher amyloid burden among those reporting six hours or fewer per night, along with worse memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers see a two-way pattern. Poor sleep can go hand in hand with rising amyloid, and rising amyloid can disrupt sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These feedback loops make sleep a practical target. It is a daily behavior with clear, measurable features and plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pills-don-t-replace-deep-sleep"&gt;Pills don’t replace deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all sleep is equal, and some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/natures-sleep-aid-cannabinol-shows-promise-as-a-safe-sedative/"&gt;sedatives&lt;/a&gt; change the structure of sleep in unhelpful ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 review reported that benzodiazepines tend to reduce the time spent in the deepest NREM stages while expanding lighter stage 2 sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also interest in a newer class of sleep medicines that act on the orexin system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small randomized trial, the insomnia drug suvorexant reduced cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau over several hours in healthy middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings do not mean a pill will protect memory or that anyone should change treatment without medical guidance. However, they do suggest that the type and depth of sleep matter at least as much as the number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-better-sleep-lower-alzheimer-s-risk"&gt;Better sleep, lower Alzheimer’s risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple habits can tilt sleep toward deeper stages. Avoiding caffeine – especially later in the day – helps the brain reach consolidated slow-wave sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement, a cool and dark bedroom, fewer screens at night, and even a warm shower an hour before bed can all make it easier to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists still need long-term studies to determine whether training &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-clears-toxic-waste-from-the-brain/"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt; over months or years can slow cognitive decline in people with rising amyloid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams are also exploring safe ways to amplify slow waves during sleep, using sound cues or gentle electrical stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is simple: help the brain keep learning day after day, even in the face of early disease markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNa2RzSEVod2xEaUJCRXBxbjhtcjZlVmRHR0Z6NTlNSlctNEZlVXFScjFRU3J1QjNGSVB2dFRoY002LXdNRkpkTjlDNmV4M2ZkbXJtMmNUZ1J4YnJEaHRMa2ktNktmaUdrRHpJS1piTHdpWWZ1Tk40R0VqNXNQVS1TVXhuQ1QtbjR1akJ6WTZnb1FsbmNkZkoyTTVucEJTU2xncW8teUtTV2hNRXJHNFE</guid></item><item><title>马歇尔镇一人死亡， 21人感染退伍军人病- KWWL</title><link>https://www.kwwl.com/news/top-stories/one-person-dead-21-infected-with-legionnaires-disease-in-marshalltown/article_164221cc-100c-4efc-a977-dd11dab2c382.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Washington state’s health department is trying to straighten out confusion about who can or should get a Covid vaccine — and has given legal heft to their recommendation. Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/COVID19VaccineStandingOrder.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; signed by the state health officer Thursday, anyone in the state can get the vaccine without consulting their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standing order means that pharmacists, nurses, and other health care providers can give the Covid vaccine to everyone 6 months or older, including pregnant people, unless there’s a specific, individual reason not to. The agency issued the order in the wake of confusing and sometimes conflicting guidance from the federal government about who’s eligible for the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/senators-from-both-parties-grilled-rfk-jr-on-vaccines-and-more" target="_blank"&gt;Senators from both parties grilled RFK Jr. on vaccines and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state agency said they continue to recommend that everyone stay up to date with the most recent Covid shot. That’s in line with advice from the major medical associations of pediatricians, family doctors, and OB-GYNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standing order is a prescription from the state health officer that addresses a disease or health threat — such as &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/Pubs/150-127-StatewideStandingOrderToDispenseNaloxone.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one that authorizes pharmacists to give Naloxone&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who wants it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This standing order gives legal cover to pharmacists, who might be confused about to whom they’re allowed to give the shot, and it gives all Washington state residents the right to get vaccinated, if they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/florida-working-to-end-vaccine-mandates" target="_blank"&gt; Florida working to end vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health agency said &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/3481125-COVID19VaccineFAQForPublic.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;people can bring a printed copy of the order to their vaccine appointment&lt;/a&gt; at, say, a pharmacy, if they’re worried they could be denied the shot. If they still cannot get vaccinated, they can file a complaint against the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on state Medicaid, or Apple Health, can get the Covid vaccine for free. For people with private insurance, coverage will depend on their individual health status and insurer, but many insurance companies are expected to continue covering the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This is because other animals have an active gene for an enzyme called uricase, which breaks down uric acid in the blood and thereby prevents the formation of crystals. However, due to a number of mutations picked up over our evolutionary history, the uricase enzyme in humans cannot process uric acid. Some researchers believe this happened because increased levels of uric acid can also turn fruit sugar into fat, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.13-243634" target="_blank" data-url="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.13-243634" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;helping primates survive winters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and grow bigger brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/us-baby-receives-first-ever-customized-crispr-treatment-for-genetic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/us-baby-receives-first-ever-customized-crispr-treatment-for-genetic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US baby receives first-ever customized CRISPR treatment for genetic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320393111" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320393111" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously identified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which ancient genes may have been responsible for producing uricase by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/3/msac041/6530294" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/3/msac041/6530294" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inferring ancestral genes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means figuring out what the genes of ancient organisms looked like by studying the DNA of living species today. Scientists compare the genes of different animals or people, use computer programs to build family trees, and then make educated guesses about what the original, ancient gene sequences were. Once they have a good idea of what those old genes looked like, they can recreate and "resurrect" the ancient proteins that the genes encode in the lab and possibly open the door to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers used CRISPR gene editing to insert the ancient uricase gene into the genomes of human &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2228" target="_blank" data-url="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2228" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver spheroids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spheroids are 3D blobs of lab-grown tissues that mimic complex, full-size organs found in the body. The insertion of the ancient gene resulted in a drop in uric acid, as well as a reduction in fat buildup related to fruit sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are existing gout therapies that use uricase to manage high levels of uric acid; for example, the treatment &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.krystexxa.com/?cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:CP2TYXD_25_NEP_KRX_UG_DTC_BRND_SRC_AL_GO_Core_N/A_7300806379-searchterm:krystexxa-adgroup:Core-keywordid:p81859646413&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk8zNOrHHvHxXoddGa6TgHCWlxwzzi9N4WEgkSWsXDBhzQ50TXFsMMaArrxEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22451017598&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADNzm_rBfI_Cg7BvcHx8f_Mchb1gd" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.krystexxa.com/?cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:CP2TYXD_25_NEP_KRX_UG_DTC_BRND_SRC_AL_GO_Core_N/A_7300806379-searchterm:krystexxa-adgroup:Core-keywordid:p81859646413&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk8zNOrHHvHxXoddGa6TgHCWlxwzzi9N4WEgkSWsXDBhzQ50TXFsMMaArrxEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22451017598&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADNzm_rBfI_Cg7BvcHx8f_Mchb1gd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Krystexxa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involves injections of uricase proteins made using a combination of pig and baboon gene sequences. However, these protein-based therapeutics often elicit &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017216302888" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017216302888" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong immune responses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and require clinical monitoring due to the risk of anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a gene therapy that restores the original, ancient human gene sequence could enable the body's own cells to produce uricase. In theory, the immune reactions could be minimized because much of the uricase protein sequence is already recognized and accepted by the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers have a long way to go before such a gene therapy could be used in human patients. For next steps, they are transitioning from liver spheroids to lab mice, and they're using nanoparticle delivery systems that introduce CRISPR gene-editing components directly into liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="666e1d2d-d576-44c1-b766-a7aed78bd3c1"&gt;Such a gene therapy has the potential to transform gout treatment by providing a long-lasting and possibly safer alternative to current therapies, the researchers say. Gene-editing therapies like this, however, are still in early stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that this approach — of taking and adapting ancient genes for modern therapies — could be more broadly applied in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My ultimate goal is to be able to wed molecular evolution and clinical medicine," Gaucher said. "Ideally we can use ancient proteins or ancient enzymes to develop therapeutics to help modern society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ-NgRdMxYMdMNQqo8DYgk0mkb4gKC5DiiR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ-NgRdMxYMdMNQqo8DYgk0mkb4gKC5DiiR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-background-1" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-background-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently facing concurrent outbreaks including mpox, cholera and malaria (1-4). The Ministry of Public Health, DRC has declared the 16th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak on 04 September 2025 after PCR confirmation of Ebola virus (EBOV), formely &lt;em&gt;Zaïre ebolavirus,&lt;/em&gt;  in patient’s specimens from Bulape Heath Zone, in Kasai Province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The re-emergence of EBOV in remote areas with very limited access is not unprecedent since 15 Ebola outbreaks have previously occurred in the country &lt;a href="https://10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00259-8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt;. In late August 2025, the local health authorities in Bulape Heath Zone, Kasai Province, DRC raised an alert about cases presenting with haemorrhagic fever symptoms and associated fatalities among both infected individuals and healthcare workers. Suspecting EVD, a buccal swab (from a fatal case) and five blood specimens were collected from six suspected cases then shipped to the national reference laboratory, Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa, for diagnosis confirmation and whole genome sequencing (WGS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-methods-2" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-methods-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 03 September 2025, six samples were tested at INRB using the point-of-care GeneXpert Ebola assay, the automated BioFire FilmArray System (Global Fever Panel), and real-time PCR with Altona RealStar Filovirus RT-PCR kit. EBOV PCR positive samples were subsequently sequenced on a nanopore sequencing device (Oxford Nanopore Technology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 140 µL of inactivated specimens using viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with LunaScript RT SuperMix kit (New England Biolabs). Multiplex PCR was performed on cDNA using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X master mix (New England Biolabs), and EBOV-specific primer pools, designed for EBOV Mangina variants, were used to amplify the EBOV genome. Library was prepared in triplicate using the rapid sequencing DNA V14 barcoding kit (SQK-RBK114.96; Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing library was loaded on a R10.4.1 flow cell and run on a GridION sequencer. Reads were base called with the High accuracy model from Guppy. Subsequently, iVar tool ( &lt;a href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"&gt;GitHub - andersen-lab/ivar: iVar is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing.&lt;/a&gt; ) was used for trimming sequencing adapters, primers, and low-quality bases, and for generating the consensus genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-results-and-discussion-3" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-results-and-discussion-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results and Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to generate an accurate consensus genome in less than one hour starting from the library preparation. The newly EBOV genome is 99.97% complete and consists of 18,819 nucleotides. Multiple sequence alignment of 71 complete EBOV genomes, including the newly generated genome, was performed using MAFFT (6). A phylogenetic tree (&lt;a href="/404"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) was constructed using IQ-TREE v2.1.4 (7). The new EBOV genome has a nucleotide similarity of 99.52% to the most closely related genome, Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga (GenBank accession number NC_002549.1), suggesting that this case represents a new zoonotic spillover event and is not directly linked to the 2007 Luebo or 2008/2009 Mweka EVD outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

Benefits lasted up to three months after just one treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Fava pointed out that the study was designed in a way that made it harder to show a benefit, because participants knew there was a good chance they would get LSD, which likely increased the placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Despite a significant placebo response, there was still a clear, robust difference at the higher LSD doses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unlike most psychedelic studies, this trial deliberately excluded therapy alongside the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's most remarkable about this study is that it did not involve any significant psychotherapy. That suggests the drug itself has long-lasting anti-anxiety effects," De Wit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;At the higher doses, most people had brief hallucinations or visual distortions, along with some nausea and headaches. Serious side effects were rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"All 40 people assigned to the 200-microgram dose reported perceptual changes. That may be part of the therapeutic effect -- we don't know. But it wasn't necessarily an adverse effect," De Wit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Still, LSD's long duration -- often eight to twelve hours -- poses challenges for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For safety reasons, I feel very strongly that drugs with psychedelic properties should be administered in a healthcare clinic, not at home," Fava cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For decades, LSD was regarded primarily as a risky hallucinogen, but attitudes are shifting as evidence builds for its potential medical uses, De Wit noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's very impressive that a single administration had effects lasting eight or even 12 weeks. But these participants were carefully screened. We need to know how safe it is in broader populations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Fava stressed the need for larger trials to confirm the study's results and noted that phase 3 trials are already underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, De Wit praised the current research as a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;" ... there should be more studies like this," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Christian S.

   &lt;p&gt;CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta vividly remembers the day he impaled himself on a wrought iron fence. He had just turned 12, and he was running through the neighborhood when he spontaneously decided to vault over a fence that he usually ran around. Except he didn't quite make it. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the spikes caught me on my side and went in the back area of my side and out the front," Gupta says. "It was the skin, thankfully, as opposed to going into the chest or into the abdomen, which would have been much worse, but it was sort of a classic in-out sort of injury."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Gupta says he was impaled for several minutes before his mother arrived to help hoist him off the fence. Looking back now, he remembers feeling a strange sense of euphoria when it happened, which he attributes to his body's natural pain relief system. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For some people, it reacts really vigorously — like really, really churns out a bunch of endorphins," he says. "And so you could have this really sort of ironic situation where you've got a terrible injury and you're almost laughing. It's a very protective sort of response from the body. And not everyone responds the same way."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his new book, &lt;em&gt;It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life&lt;/em&gt;, Gupta, a trained neurosurgeon, writes about pain — what causes it, and the various medications that can be used to treat it. He also reflects on ways to train the mind to minimize certain kinds of pain, using distraction and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With pain, people are usually hyper-focused on a particular sensation. Being able to take them out of that hyper-focus can be really helpful," he says. "The idea [is] that you could take someone's pain score from really terrible pain to a zero out of 10 ... for the 30 minutes that they are meditating. ... I think the brain can be trained that way."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On mistakes the brain makes in processing pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the best examples of how the brain can make a mistake is phantom limb pain ... It was amputated, and yet it still hurts. I think that's one of those sort of insights about the brain that I think led to a lot of learning about what exactly the brain's role was with pain. If the brain's the decider of pain, can it create pain as well? And the answer is yes. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Referred pain is another sort of mistake. So some people may be having what should be chest pain from a heart attack, but instead of having chest pain, they may have jaw pain. They may have just left arm pain. ... And then there's sorts of things where whatever the reason may be, the brain continues to play the loop of pain over and over again. I guess that's not so much a mistake as it is maybe some sort of glitch, where the pain loop doesn't stop and it just gets recycled over and over again, and that's chronic pain. So those are some of the ways that the brain can sort of either mistake or misinterpret the signals and the pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how pleasure can rewire brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What I think is really interesting is that we have this system within our body, the endogenous opioid system. … This is like our internal morphine system, endorphin system. We can activate this system in all sorts of different ways. And by activating, I mean exactly what it sounds like. You just basically release a lot of these endorphins, these basically personalized morphine molecules all throughout your body. And one of the ways that they have shown can really facilitate that is to not just practice gratitude, but to actively practice gratitude. Meaning, actually savor something. I'm not just grateful for this ice cream cone. I'm so enjoying this ice-cream cone. I'm just not grateful for being able to look at this sunset. I am gazing at every different color in the sky and just taking it all in. It's a very active form of gratitude. And it seems to be very associated with basically activating the endogenous opioid system, which is really fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On opioid drugs compared to the body's natural opioid system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So many techniques and medications that we use in real life take their inspiration from our human body, and that's one of them. … With your own opioid system, it is very, very sensitive. So it can turn on and it can turn off really, really well. So instead of having the lingering sort of side effects of opioids and sedation and all these other things, the opioids that you make yourself can just be washed away very, very quickly. … &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I always say if the endogenous opioid system didn't exist, women would probably never have more than one child. It can be a painful experience, but those [natural] opioids help with the pain. They help with the mood, and … [they] can actually inhibit your memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how inflammation serves a purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I think for the most part, inflammation has sort of gotten a bad rap. ... I think when you look at a sprained ankle, for example, and it looks swollen and red, the idea that I want to get rid of that. That's associated with my pain makes intuitive sense. I think the idea that that inflammation serves a real purpose, that not only is it sort of helping protect the site of injury, but also sending all these various molecules to the site of injury to help with the healing. ...&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thing about pain is that everyone's threshold is going to be a little bit different. … I think for a lot of people, they think they need to take anti-inflammatories. Oh, this is bad, I gotta treat that, that inflammation's not good, that's hurting my body. But if I flip the script on you and I say, "It's not bad for your body, that is exactly how your body is supposed to work. This is your body doing its job."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a new FDA approved non-opioid pain medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The medication is called Suzetrigine. … It is a fascinating story of how it came about. There were these families of circus performers in Karachi, Pakistan. That got the attention of researchers, whatever, 25, 30 years ago. And they saw that these circus performers were able to do all these remarkable things, like they could put sharp things through their appendages and they could walk on hot coals and do all that sort of stuff. But what they found was that when they were doing this, they could feel the coals on their feet and they could feel that they were hot, they just didn't have pain. … And that was pretty striking because it gave these researchers a clue as to which sodium channel blocker may be important when it came to just targeting pain and not sensation overall. They studied this family. They found that they had a gene in common. ... And basically for 25 years, these researchers tried to replicate what that gene was doing in the body. ... Now, one of the big challenges of creating a medicine like that is you didn't want to take away pain forever. Pain has utility. It can keep you safe. It can teach you lessons. So they wanted to create a half-life for the drug. So they basically now have an oral formulation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resnx-s1-5527017-103" class="bucketwrap pullquote"&gt;
            
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Cannabis for pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I walked into it thinking that if I really examined all this literature, there was going to be a pretty compelling case made for using cannabis for all sorts of different pains … and I walked away not as impressed, to be quite honest, as I thought I would be. And this is just the data talking. I will say it's hard to collect this data when you're dealing with a substance that has been a level one substance in the United States for a long time. It's just really hard to get good studies.  …&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But having said that, the best available data seem to suggest that for about a third of the people, it could be pretty effective, and maybe in some cases as effective as the best other options for that neuropathic pain. … For about two-thirds of people, it really did not seem to be that effective. And this is the case, I think, for about a third of people, they get significant benefit. And we don't quite know who those third of the people are. We don't know what makes them different than the other two-thirds that they're getting that kind of relief.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars reached out to Google for an explanation, receiving a cryptic and somewhat unsatisfying reply. "Showing accurate information on Maps is a top priority," says a Google spokesperson. "We’re working to fix this technical issue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we are not aware of other Maps searches that have been similarly affected. Google has yet to respond to further questions on the nature of the apparent glitch, which has wiped out COVID vaccine information in Maps while continuing to return results for other medical services and immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden eroding of federal support for routine vaccinations lurks in the background with this bizarre issue. When the Trump administration decided to rename the Gulf of Mexico, Google was widely hectored for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/bowing-to-trump-google-maps-plans-to-quickly-rename-the-gulf-of-mexico/"&gt;its decision to quickly show&lt;/a&gt; "Gulf of America" on its maps, aligning with the administration's preferred nomenclature. With the ramping up of anti-vaccine actions at the federal level, it is tempting to see a similar, nefarious purpose behind these disappearing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, we have no evidence that the change in Google's search results was intentional or targeted specifically at COVID immunization—indeed, making that change in such a ham-fisted way would be inadvisable. It does seem like an ill-timed and unusually specific "technical issue," though. If Google provides further details on the missing search results, we'll post an update.&lt;/p&gt;

However, instead of making her value her life and body more, the experience has made her hedonistic!&lt;/p&gt;

Her logic is, she was healthy before and still developed cancer, why not indulge? I’ve shared with her that alcohol is carcinogenic, and studies have shown that healthy diets and exercise make a significant difference in cancer survival, but she keeps saying that it’s her choice. She even kicked me out of her house the last time I was there! I have high blood pressure so I can’t eat certain foods, and she has cancer and needs to steer clear of anything that will trigger it. It’s not her fault, but that’s what it is to have a disease. She refuses to discuss any of this, and every conversation ends in a fight now. How do I get through to her that this is not judgement, it’s concern for her very life?&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, so, when people are lucky enough to survive cancer, they have all sorts of feelings! In the past 18 months since my stage 1 lung cancer surgery, I have been: euphoric, ragey, terrified, exuberant, depressed, desperate to be alone, desperate to be surrounded by people, energized, fatigued, and lots of other things. I have also had to balance &lt;em&gt;other people’s&lt;/em&gt; feelings about my cancer. And that is, pardon me, fucking exhausting. I get that you are operating from a place of love and concern, but unless you are an oncologist, you need to back off, now, or risk seriously damaging your relationship with your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

I really hate that you had to manage other people’s emotions when you were going through so much yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54fz00223579lesbzd8n@published"&gt;Also, one doesn’t have to have had cancer to understand this kind of mom and this kind of fretting. I think it’s fair to say that the Letter Writer is probably what the kids are now calling an “&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/almond-mom"&gt;Almond Mom&lt;/a&gt;”—someone whose identity is really wrapped up in staying healthy (read: thin) and all that it entails, who thinks three almonds make a totally reasonable snack, and who gets really bent out of shape if other people (especially people who are her daughter!) are not following the same program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54md0023357918jzgwcl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: I had not heard of an “Almond Mom” before, but that is quite a coinage. When someone we love gets sick, there is a desire, often unconscious, to make sure we keep the worst at bay. It is natural, it is human, and it also comes very close to blaming a sick person for being sick. You’re not wrong that alcohol is carcinogenic. It is! But there is a fine line between noting that something is a carcinogen and saying it will “trigger” cancer. I say this especially as someone who had a kind of cancer with a huge stigma. You would not believe how many times people asked me if I am a smoker (no, I have a genetic mutation, but even if I had been a pack a day smoker–rude question!).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54st00243579wsohu5ew@published"&gt;Nothing makes a cancer patient feel worse than the implication that they are being cavalier with their health. Tell your daughter that you love her, that her cancer scared you, and that your fear about her mortality has made you phrase some things badly. Apologize, then ask her what you can do to support her. I promise this will be vastly more effective than shame and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54yj00253579wcpgfv9q@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I can’t believe people asked if you smoked! I mean, I can totally understand if they wondered whether you smoked, but to actually ask? Wow.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s555800263579a4h8hvq4@published"&gt;Anyway, that’s great advice that is hard to follow. But I guess I will add one more little thing: LW, you clearly love your daughter. And you clearly have a strong sense that physical health is precious and important, which tells me you’re someone who is in touch with how valuable life is. So I hope you can take all that and expand it a little to embrace the idea that living a good, enjoyable life—not just surviving for a long time—is also valuable! Your daughter is doing things that bring her pleasure. Might they lead to a shorter life than consuming a strict, no alcohol diet and spending every spare minute doing calisthenics and popping supplements instead of watching TV? Sure. However, maybe the goal is not to live as long as humanly possible, but to live a reasonably long time in a way that’s not defined by restriction. And do you know what else is bad for quality of life? Fighting with your mom. So if you really care about her, drop this topic and make sure conflict with you isn’t a part of her last five, 10,15 or 50 years on &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to lose weight, you've probably been told that cooking your own meals is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been backed up by a recent study, which found that people who ate home-cooked, minimally processed foods lost twice the weight compared to those who ate mainly ultra-processed, ready-made foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, involved 50 adults who were randomly assigned to eat either a diet high in ultra-processed foods or one with mostly minimally-processed foods. Both diets were designed to meet the UK's &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;national dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups lost weight, which makes sense as they consumed fewer calories than they usually did. However, the group that consumed mostly minimally processed foods ultimately consumed fewer calories overall – thereby losing more weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also saw slightly greater improvements to other measures of their health, such as having lower fat mass, reduced triglyceride levels (linked to heart health) and fewer cravings for unhealthy foods at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultra-processed foods group still lost weight and saw some improvements in blood lipids (fat) and blood glucose (sugar), but these changes were generally smaller than those seen in the minimally processed foods group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, this is both an interesting and important piece of research – even though the results are not entirely surprising. In fact, a surprising result is that the consumption of ultra-processed food still resulted in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimally processed diet group consumed fewer calories overall, which would explain why this group lost more weight. But the fact that this group saw greater improvements in other areas of their health highlights how health encompasses far more than calories or a number on the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_118286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118286" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-642x260.jpg" alt="Pizza and processed foods" class="size-medium wp-image-118286" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-118286" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Processed foods tend to have less fibre, more added fats, sugars and salt. (Anastasiia Krivenok/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why processing matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad press, &lt;a href="https://www.ift.org/-/media/policy-advocacy/files/ift_spi_white-paper_processed-foods_1023.pdf"&gt;food processing&lt;/a&gt; plays an essential role in food safety and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much processing a food has undergone seems to be the factor associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;worse health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. These foods tend to have less fibre, more added fats, sugars and salt. This is because they're designed to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;tasty and long-lasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;most common definition&lt;/a&gt; of an ultra-processed foods are foods which are industrially produced and which contain extracts of original foods alongside additives and industrial ingredients. Think crisps or frozen ready meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food system in much of the world has become increasingly reliant on ultra-processed foods, with these foods contributing to about half of food intake in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905428/"&gt;the UK, Europe and the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's clear evidence that high intake of ultra-processed foods is linked with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="173152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more calorie-rich, less nutritious foods we consume, the more our health will suffer – as this recent study has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can you work out which foods are classified as "ultra-processed" and which are only "minimally processed"? In short, this depends on how much processing a food product has undergone to be ready for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are industrially formulated products made mostly from ingredients extracted from foods (such as oils, starches and proteins) and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples include: sugary breakfast cereals, flavoured yoghurts with sweeteners and thickeners, soft drinks, instant noodles, packaged biscuits and cakes, mass-produced bread with emulsifiers and reconstituted meat products – such as chicken nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimally processed foods are whole foods that are altered only to make them safer or easier to prepare. Importantly, this processing doesn't change their nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples include: fresh, frozen or bagged vegetables and fruit, plain yoghurt or milk, whole grains (such as oats or brown rice), eggs, fresh or frozen fish, and tinned beans or tomatoes without added sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150795" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-642x428.jpeg" alt="Foods including meat, eggs, bananas, broccoli, sunflower seeds, beans, lentils, avocado, mushrooms, peanuts and sweat potato" class="size-medium wp-image-150795" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-642x428.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-622x415.jpeg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6.jpeg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150795" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Minimally processed foods are whole foods that are altered only to make them safer or easier to prepare. (fcafotodigital/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Including minimally processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes feel overwhelming to work out whether a food is ultra-processed or minimally processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advice that is often suggested for working out whether a food is ultra-processed include checking to see if a product contains more than five to ten ingredients and considering if it contains ingredients you wouldn't use at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the number of ingredients, it's also the type of ingredients that matter. Ultra-processed foods often contain added sugars, refined starches, emulsifiers, stabilisers and flavourings that serve cosmetic purposes (such as improving colour, texture or taste), rather than preserving the food's freshness or safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimally processed foods will not contain these types of ingredients, nor will they have as many ingredients on their label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to be aware of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;smoked meats&lt;/a&gt;. While this is a common preservation method, most commercially available smoked meats – such as bacon, ham or sausages – are considered ultra-processed because of the curing agents and other additives they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plain smoked fish (such as smoked salmon) is still classed as a processed food, it uses fewer curing agents and additives than other smoked meat products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet rich in minimally processed foods usually means more fibre, more nutrients and fewer calories – all of which can support weight and long-term health, as this recent study showed. So if you're keen to include more minimally processed foods in your diet, here are a few tips to help you get more onto your plate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build meals around vegetables, whole grains and pulses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use tinned or frozen products for convenience and to save time while cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose plain dairy products without sugar or fruit purees, then add your own fruits, nuts and seeds for flavour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healthy meals don't have to be complicated. Aim to include a protein source, a wholegrain carbohydrate and plenty of veggies or fruits at each meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batch cook meals when you have time and freeze them if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, it's important to point out that there's a distinction between the potential harms of excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods and the essential role processing can play in ensuring food safety, preservation and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important not to panic about enjoying the occasional biscuit or ready meal, and we should avoid demonising convenience foods – especially for those who face barriers such as limited mobility or lack of cooking facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because remember, the group that ate a diet high in ultra-processed foods but met dietary guidelines still lost weight and saw health benefits in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well doesn't mean that you need to completely eliminate ultra-processed foods. But shifting the balance towards eating more minimally processed foods, with more home-cooked meals where possible, is a step in the right direction.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262669/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can Azelastine nasal spray really protect against catching a case of COVID?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an excerpt from &lt;a href="https://mccormickmd.substack.com/p/covidlandia-in-august-company" target="_blank"&gt;this month’s Covidlandia run down&lt;/a&gt; I just sent out to my peeps:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;~&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was really excited by this study, and overall remain optimistic that azelastine nasal spray (available by prescription and OTC) has a place at the table of possible ways to reduce transmission a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;a randomized controlled trial&lt;/em&gt;, considered the only thing that matters to certain &lt;em&gt;randos&lt;/em&gt;. But still!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Open Network&lt;/em&gt; two days ago, the CONTAIN Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating &lt;strong&gt;azelastine nasal spray for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/strong&gt; The study included 450 healthy volunteers who received either 0.1% azelastine nasal spray or placebo three times daily for approximately 56 days. Normally people use the spray only twice daily for treatment of allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azelastine significantly &lt;strong&gt;reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections by 67%&lt;/strong&gt; compared to placebo (2.2% vs 6.7% absolute infection rate over 56 days). Secondary benefits included &lt;strong&gt;reduced symptomatic infections&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;longer time to infection starting&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;shorter duration of viral positivity.&lt;/strong&gt; The spray also demonstrated efficacy against rhinovirus infections and showed broader antiviral effects against multiple respiratory pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuance and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study had several constraints affecting interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;modest sample size&lt;/strong&gt; and low incidence of certain infections limited statistical power for subgroup analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A key concern involves &lt;strong&gt;rapid antigen test limitations&lt;/strong&gt; potentially leading to underreporting of infections, particularly in the azelastine group. Since azelastine may reduce viral load, infections with lower viral loads might go undetected by the less sensitive antigen tests, making azelastine appear more preventive when it might instead be making infections less detectable. However, &lt;em&gt;this effect would still represent a benefit in my opinion&lt;/em&gt; - individuals with undetectable viral loads would likely have fewer symptoms and reduced contagiousness. High viral loads have also been associated with higher risk of Long Covid&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the placebo vehicle itself might have had protective effects through barrier-enhancing properties.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As a single-center trial in a mostly healthy, vaccinated population, generalizability to other settings may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings suggest azelastine nasal spray could serve as an accessible prophylactic strategy, though larger multi-center trials are needed for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would do that situationally. I have bad allergies anyway. Very safe medicine with limited systemic absorption, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

About two-thirds of participants reported scrolling through their smartphones while sitting on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Those who were glued to their phone while using the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to those who left their device in another room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The likely explanation is that prolonged sitting increases pressure in the veins around the rectum, which can contribute to hemorrhoids," Dr. Ernesto Gonzaga, a gastroenterologist from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and who did not contribute to the study, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scrollers spent a longer time on the toilet, the researchers found -- about five times as many smartphone users logged over five minutes of toilet time per visit. When researchers asked what they were doing on their phones while doing their business, people confessed to catching up on the news, cruising through their social media feeds, or sending emails and texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Gonzaga pointed out that phone users also reported getting less exercise than non-users, suggesting that their broader lifestyle patterns could also contribute to their risk of hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Stock photo of a person using their phone while going to the bathroom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Antonio Hugo Photo/STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels around the anus and rectum, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

It looked at a small number of subjects and relied on self-reporting, so it doesn't necessarily prove that phone use on the toilet is a direct cause of hemorrhoids, he said.

Xanthelasma is the most common; it’s found around the eyelids and is either benign or a sign of high cholesterol. Other types include eruptive xanthomas, tuberous xanthomas, tendinous xanthomas and plane xanthomas. Depending on which one we’re talking about, they can appear on your elbow, palm, joints, tendons, hands or feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure if you’re looking at that or something different? You can get a biopsy to rule out skin lesions, Dr. Arunachalam explains, but usually, an experienced clinician and dermatologist will be able to identify the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/common-issue-people-over-50-152500696.html" data-ylk="slk:The Common Issue for People Over 50 That’s a Surprising Sign of Heart Disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Common Issue for People Over 50 That’s a Surprising Sign of Heart Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, treating the high cholesterol (if present) can prevent new xanthomas and may reduce existing ones, Dr. Moore adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ways to lower cholesterol include &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/one-thing-cardiologist-begging-start-112500786.html" data-ylk="slk:fitting in 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fitting in 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week&lt;/a&gt; and eating &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/worried-cholesterol-levels-try-incorporating-215159479.html" data-ylk="slk:foods that lower cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;foods that lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, such as oats, salmon, raspberries, dark chocolate, carrots, whole grain bread, extra virgin olive oil, apples, cashews, black beans, green tea and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Skin Changes That May Be Linked to Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note that xanthomas aren’t the only skin change that can point to a heart issue.

In mice, this mutation reduced sociability and defensive aggression by limiting vasopressin reaching the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed that vasopressin acts through two distinct receptors: AVPR1a for sociability and AVPR1b for aggression. By selectively targeting AVPR1a, they restored social interaction without triggering unwanted aggressive responses, opening the door to personalized therapies for autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Shank3 mutation reduces vasopressin release in the lateral septum, impairing sociability and aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receptor Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; AVPR1a receptor regulates sociability, while AVPR1b controls aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Selective AVPR1a activation improved social behavior in mice without increasing aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UMH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cognition and Social Interactions laboratory, led by Félix Leroy at the Institute for Neurosciences, a joint center of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Miguel Hernández University (UMH) of Elche, has identified for the first time the mechanism linking a mutation in the &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; gene with alterations in social behavior. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model carrying this autism-associated mutation, the study shows that vasopressin, a brain hormone essential for social relationships, is not properly released in the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that the proper release of vasopressin in this region regulates social behaviors through two distinct receptor pathways: one controlling sociability and the other controlling social aggression, and that selective activation of these receptors can reverse deficits in social interaction without triggering unwanted aggressive responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide the first detailed explanation of how a genetic mutation linked to autism leads to problems in social interaction. Until now, the &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; gene had been associated with the disorder, but the biological mechanism underlying this connection remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, as this study demonstrates, lies in vasopressin: a brain hormone that acts as a messenger between neurons and is essential for regulating sociability and aggression in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that in animals with the mutation, part of the population of vasopressin-releasing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was lost. In addition, they confirmed that these neurons release vasopressin in the lateral septum. As a result, little vasopressin reached the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alteration explains why the mutant mice showed reduced sociability and a marked decrease in defensive aggression, a behavior that, under normal conditions, allows males to defend their territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also shows that vasopressin acts in the lateral septum through two different receptors, each responsible for a specific aspect of behavior: receptor AVPR1a controls sociability, while receptor AVPR1b regulates social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers manipulated these receptors, they were able to restore each behavior independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We managed to improve sociability without increasing aggression, which is fundamental if we are thinking about a future treatment”, explains Leroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the team used a new vasopressin biosensor developed in collaboration with Yulong Li’s laboratory at Peking University. This tool, never before applied to this hormone, made it possible to visualize in real time how vasopressin was released in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to this technology, we were able to demonstrate that the alteration was not present across the entire nervous system, but in a very specific circuit,” emphasizes María Helena Bortolozzo-Gleich, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, collaboration with researchers at the University of Zurich made it possible to validate the reliability of the results through computational data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this research are protected by a patent application aimed at developing drugs capable of selectively activating the AVPR1a receptor, which is responsible for sociability. The goal is to design therapies that improve social deficits in people with autism without inducing side effects related to aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in male mice because the vasopressin pathway is more developed in males, and only they display the territorial aggression under study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sex difference could help explain, at least in part, why autism is more frequent in males, although it is also possible that in females the disorder manifests differently or is underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that future treatments could be personalized, taking these differences into account,” adds Leroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study has been supported by funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the CIDEGENT fellowship program of the Generalitat Valenciana, the Severo Ochoa Foundation, and the “la Caixa” Foundation. It was also supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA), the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is part of the &lt;em&gt;MotivatedBehaviors&lt;/em&gt; project (H2020-ERC-STG/0784, n°949652), which aims to study the role of the lateral septum in regulating motivated behaviors to uncover the changes that occur in disorders associated with social behavior deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this line, Leroy has developed extensive expertise in studying this brain region. In 2023, his group published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; a study showing how corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling from the prefrontal cortex to the lateral septum suppresses interaction with familiar individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scientific trajectory has consolidated Leroy as a reference in the field, a recognition further reinforced by the EBBS Mid Career Award, recently granted by the European Brain and Behaviour Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#711016101d1d100331041c195f1402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angeles Gallar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umh.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angeles Gallar – UMH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61994-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impaired vasopressin neuromodulation of the lateral septum leads to social behavior deficits in Shank3B+/- male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Félix Leroy et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired vasopressin neuromodulation of the lateral septum leads to social behavior deficits in Shank3B+/- male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has been repeatedly associated with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice, a model of ASD, exhibit deficits in sociability and social aggression, we focused on the lateral septum (LS), a brain region involved in the regulation of motivated behaviors and observed reduced AVP inputs from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to LS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manipulating AVP release from the BNST to LS of wild-type male mice, we found that AVP promotes both sociability and social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) in LS impaired sociability, while blocking the receptor 1b (AVPR1b) disrupted social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, selective activation of AVPR1a or AVPR1b rescued the respective behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that AVP release in LS modulates two distinct social behaviors via different receptors and highlight a possible strategy to rescue sociability during ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:24:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5DNmtqVDYwMmw3aWxCSGxLMVBmNjY5WjNiaEVDLXUwRFZmMnk3d1E2WkpFV0pPb3E4R3NXUDBReTYzcG9xVi1VN0c0bzU0NGVybnE5N1ZFcDU1eGVSQXR6Q05STXlWWkpsUmhXSnp1bU5md3lBaWREbjNwVQ</guid></item><item><title>旧金山猫在食用受禽流感污染的宠物食品后被安乐死- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/sf-cat-food-bird-flu-21030651.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Yet despite an abundance of research, the earliest brain changes that trigger this disease still remain unclear, making it challenging to find effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could lithium – a metal most of us know better for its use in batteries or as a treatment for mood disorders – play a role in cognitive health? &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02471-4"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; shows that this mineral may play a key role in protecting against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is linked to the buildup of two harmful proteins: amyloid-beta and tau. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3505"&gt;Amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; clumps outside brain cells (neurons), forming sticky plaques that block communication. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28386764/#:%7E:text=Tau%20is%20well%20established%20as%20a%20microtubule%2Dassociated%20protein%20in%20neurons.&amp;amp;text=Recent%20advances%20in%20our%20understanding%20of%20the,synaptic%20plasticity%2C%20and%20regulation%20of%20genomic%20stability."&gt;Tau&lt;/a&gt; twists into tangles inside cells, disrupting their structure and function. Together, they damage the delicate network of neurons that supports memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for nearly a decade now, scientists from Harvard University have also been uncovering lithium’s unexpected importance in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium is naturally present in small amounts in the brain. This lithium comes from our diet, where it’s transported through the bloodstream to the brain’s cells. But researchers have found that as people move from &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1533317518791401"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; – a stage often seen as a warning sign for Alzheimer’s – to full Alzheimer’s disease, their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Sec11"&gt;lithium levels drop&lt;/a&gt;. This loss of lithium appears to set off the cascade of changes that lead to memory loss and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Sec11"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; now helps to explain why a loss of lithium is linked with Alzheimer’s disease. The study showed that lithium acts as a natural defender – helping to keep amyloid and tau in check. When lithium levels fall, the brain becomes more vulnerable to these toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers uncovered this connection by conducting postmortem examinations of brain tissue taken from people who had been in different stages of cognitive health. Those with mild cognitive impairment had noticeably less lithium in their brains compared to those who had been in good cognitive health. Levels were even lower in Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found that the lithium doesn’t just disappear. Much of it becomes trapped within amyloid plaques, which lock it away from the brain cells where it’s needed most. This means even if total lithium levels don’t drop drastically, brain cells may still be starved of its protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to explore what happens when lithium is missing completely, the scientists then studied mice – both healthy mice and mice that had been genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer’s symptoms. They cut the mice’s dietary lithium by 50% and observed the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking. Mice with reduced lithium showed faster amyloid and tau buildup, more brain inflammation and lost connections between neurons – all crucial for learning and memory. The genetically engineered mice also performed worse in memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this process is an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2860202/"&gt;GSK3β&lt;/a&gt;. Lithium normally keeps this enzyme under control. But when lithium is low, GSK3β becomes overactive, encouraging tau to behave abnormally and form tangles that damage neurons. This enzyme acts like a switch, tipping brain cells toward disease if unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is the study didn’t stop at identifying the problem. Researchers treated mice with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8413749/"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, a form of the mineral that’s less likely to get trapped by amyloid plaques. This treatment prevented the harmful buildup of amyloid-beta and tau, reduce inflammation, preserved neuron connections and improved memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lithium’s importance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research recasts lithium as more than a forgotten trace mineral. It appears to be a vital guardian of brain health, protecting neurons and maintaining cognitive function throughout life. Disrupting lithium balance might be one of the earliest steps toward Alzheimer’s – even before symptoms show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium’s protective role isn’t entirely new. It’s been used in psychiatry for decades, particularly to manage &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9484534/"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; where it stabilises mood. But medicinal doses are much higher than the tiny amounts naturally present in the brain. This study is the first to reveal that even these small, natural levels have a crucial protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Alzheimer’s, lithium supports brain growth, shields nerve cells, and calms inflammation, all important for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10227915/"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping lithium levels stable could have wider benefits in preventing dementia and supporting brain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason lithium hasn’t featured prominently in Alzheimer’s research before is its simplicity. It doesn’t target one molecule but acts like a conductor, balancing multiple brain processes. This makes it harder to study but no less important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that lithium deficiency worsens Alzheimer’s damage opens new possibilities. Unlike current treatments focusing on removing amyloid plaques or tau tangles, lithium replacement could boost the brain’s defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium orotate is especially promising because it doesn’t get trapped by amyloid and delivers lithium where neurons most need it. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6643006/"&gt;Lithium salts&lt;/a&gt; have long been used safely in medicine, so this approach could be easy and accessible for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s unclear why lithium levels fall in some people. Is it due to diet, genetics or another cause? Could differences in the natural levels of lithium in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11364728/"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; worldwide influence Alzheimer’s risk? These puzzles invite future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that much of this work was done in mice. While animal models offer valuable insights, human brains are more complex. Clinical trials will be needed to see if lithium orotate can safely prevent or slow Alzheimer’s in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also don’t yet know how supplements or diet might affect brain lithium levels over time, or if this would be practical as treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the idea that a simple mineral could delay or prevent one of the world’s most devastating diseases is both exciting and hopeful.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262880/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262880/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

She revealed that she learned on the third day after Devi’s birth that her daughter was born with two holes in her heart. Bipasha described the experience as far tougher than the smile she now wears and said she wouldn’t wish it on any mother. She shared her story to support other mothers, noting how difficult it was to find guidance and support during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early days were overwhelming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress further spoke about Devi’s condition, visibly emotional as she spoke. She admitted that neither she nor Karan fully understood what a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was initially. The early days were overwhelming for the couple, leaving them in a blur. While they wanted to celebrate the birth of their daughter, the reality of her heart condition left them feeling numb and unsure of how to process everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also opened up about preparing for Devi’s surgery, revealing that Karan Singh Grover initially struggled to come to terms with it. She shared that the first five months after Devi’s birth were extremely challenging, but praised their daughter’s resilience from day one. Doctors advised monthly scans to monitor if the ventricular septal defect could heal on its own, but given the size of the hole, surgery was deemed inevitable and best performed when Devi was three months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Facing the tough decision&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipasha recalled the third month when they went for Devi’s scan. She shared that she had done extensive research, met surgeons, visited hospitals, and consulted doctors, feeling mentally prepared for the surgery, while Karan was not. She was determined that their daughter would be fine, and thankfully, Devi came through successfully. The most challenging part, she added, was making the decision to operate at the right place and the right time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress also revealed to Neha that Devi’s surgery lasted six hours, and admitted she didn’t sleep for 40 days and 40 nights, emphasizing the emotional toll the period took on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwJBVV95cUxOUk11NVJNc19NZE54bFR0VW1XOHBQWDhtT2tFM0hhVHpPLXN1TmQzdXpIUTJ1a1E2SnNfN29hX1hLUGotR0tWYUVrd1A2RjFIUHhTUjFHa0hIamNXc1BGMUtvcUJCZ05NdjR4aDU2UmdRaDVkbE0yTDZvVlJ6bDdPaDM2YXBTMTBoXzBENGhUMnFObGZkaTkwX1UtSDNoSUozOGJySmJJUkQ4Qi1hWlBzUkxvbzVkMldOaGx1a3ByT09pcFJjeUpiZFR0ay1ucjlSWlZoZ2ZJVjJtVldkRm1hdHllQWJ2MEpqOFZMbFBlX1oxMjJXLUJRTEk3RHBhNnJXTnMzMnRKWjFxSElkWEZuQXdzQjZ2U0FRNWNnTlNFd3lJZXh6bFNyWEdRSVNtNzlEemdnSElkNA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，空气污染会导致毁灭性的痴呆症-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/04/fine-particulate-air-pollution-trigger-forms-dementia-study-lewy-body</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fine-particulate air pollution can drive devastating forms of dementia by triggering the formation of toxic clumps of protein that destroy nerve cells as they spread through the brain, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exposure to the airborne particles causes proteins in the brain to misfold into the clumps, which are hallmarks of Lewy body dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"environment","tags":[{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"society/dementia","type":"Keyword","title":"Dementia"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/iansample","type":"Contributor","title":"Ian Sample","twitterHandle":"iansample","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8e4848b5cd47215a09f2a5d1f2d4dd9d","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9455f2ae800441cdaea2f1e216d52ea5"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-environment","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Environment"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"environment/2025/sep/04/fine-particulate-air-pollution-trigger-forms-dementia-study-lewy-body","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The finding has “profound implications” for preventing the neurodegenerative disorder, which affects millions worldwide, with scientists calling for a concerted effort to improve air quality by cutting emissions from industrial activity and vehicle exhausts, improving wildfire management and reducing wood burning in homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unlike age or genetics, this is something we can change,” said Dr Xiaobo Mao, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US and the study’s lead investigator. “The most direct implication is that clean air policies are brain health policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers began by analysing hospital records from 56.5 million US patients who were admitted for the first time between 2000 and 2014 with Lewy body-related neurodegenerative disease. Armed with the patients’ zip codes, the scientists estimated their long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution, airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre. These can be inhaled deep into the lungs and are found in the bloodstream, brain and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 raised the risk of Lewy body dementia, but had less of an impact on rates of another neurodegenerative brain disease that is not driven by the toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lewy bodies are made from a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein is crucial for healthy brain functioning, but can misfold in various ways to produce different kinds of harmful Lewy bodies. These can kill nerve cells and cause devastating disease by spreading through the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To see if air pollution could trigger Lewy bodies, the team exposed mice to PM2.5 pollution every other day for 10 months. Some were normal mice, but others were genetically modified to prevent them making alpha-synuclein. The results were striking: in normal mice, nerve cells died off, leading to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. The genetically modified mice were largely unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further work in mice showed that PM2.5 pollution drove the formation of aggressive, resilient and toxic clumps of alpha-synuclein clumps that looked very similar to Lewy bodies in humans. Although the work is in mice, the findings are considered compelling evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Putting the two together, to me, indicates that there’s a pretty strong association with air pollution causing Lewy body dementia. We think it’s a very important driving factor for dementia,” said Ted Dawson, a senior author on the study and a professor in neurodegenerative diseases at Johns Hopkins. “There needs to be a concerted effort to keep our air clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The work, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu4132" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, builds on previous studies that have found PM2.5s in people’s brains where damage has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reductions in intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our findings have profound implications for prevention because they identify air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for Lewy body dementia,” Mao told the Guardian. “By lowering our collective exposure to air pollution, we can potentially reduce the risk of developing these devastating neurodegenerative conditions on a population-wide scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, researchers at University College London and the Francis Crick Institute in London &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/does-air-pollution-cause-dementia-uk-scientists-launch-study-to-find-out" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launched a project called Rapid&lt;/a&gt;, for Role of Air Pollution in Dementia, to investigate how the air we breathe may harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is an important and compelling study that deepens our understanding of how air pollution can drive neurodegenerative disease,” said Prof Charles Swanton, a co-leader of the Rapid project and deputy clinical director at the Crick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By linking fine-particulate matter exposure to the biology of Lewy body dementia, it provides a mechanistic bridge between environmental exposure and disease pathology. More broadly, the work underscores the urgent need to understand and mitigate the impact of air pollution on dementia and disease risk more broadly, given its enormous and growing public health burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNQmhoU0E2MWNxWTJ6ZjVIeTliY25ONzhpNzktam94aVJHa3o1aU5rRkIyMTZiX2Jsd2xVb3ZmZmdrZXVnbHlJMHRKSVlmdFVOcm9WelYwWmRySDBaMVdsekE5b09GT3VEUWlBNVBiNkg3TVNiY0FJYk55ZnkzTnlRb29FWTZBd1VJbkNuS09zaTYycnpoRkJGNG9DOGMxanR6SVVNaTJkS0RpSS1qYjAzQzdSN3Q2VmRHRVh6ZUxn</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏协会发布血压指南改革...对您意味着什么-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15066223/American-Heart-Association-issues-overhaul-blood-pressure-guidelines-means-YOU.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the widespread belief that hypertension or high blood pressure is an old-age problem, doctors are increasingly treating younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now estimated that about 25 percent of young adults (aged 18 to 39) have hypertension, a reading of anything higher than 130/80 mm Hg, and a notable percentage of children and adolescents (aged eight to 19) are also affected. Meanwhile, half of US adults suffer from high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition can lead to serious health complications later in life, such as heart disease and stroke, as well as kidney disease, cognitive decline and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-high-blood-pressure-guideline-emphasizes-prevention-early-treatment-to-reduce-cvd-risk"&gt;American Heart Association's&lt;/a&gt; guidelines, which have been revamped for the first time since 2017, there is a greater emphasis on preventative measures to 'address the growing burden of morbidity and mortality attributable to high blood pressure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart specialists have established a tool called PREVENT: Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease events. It is a calculator to estimate 10- and 30-year cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes variables such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and other health indicators, including zip code as a proxy for social drivers of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measures also provide updated guidance on medication options, including using GLP-1 medications for some patients with high blood pressure who are overweight or obese, and recommendations for managing hypertension, before, during and after pregnancy, as the condition can cause life-threatening complications during these periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the American Heart Association's PREVENT equation for estimating cardiovascular risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diet recommendations were also made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to small dietary changes, in adults with or without hypertension, the new guidelines recommend potassium-based salt substitutes over traditional table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologists note that this can be useful to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure and hypertension, 'particularly for patients in whom salt intake is related mostly to food preparation or flavoring at home'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults are advised to limit their sodium intake to less than 2,300mg per day, moving toward an ideal limit of 1,500mg per day, by checking food labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at diets as a whole, the heart health experts recommend the DASH diet, which emphasizes reduced sodium intake and a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and low-fat or nonfat dairy, and includes lean meats and poultry, fish and non-tropical oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, concerning alcohol consumption, the guidelines recommend consuming no alcohol or for those who choose to drink, consuming no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other pointers in the guidelines to prevent the risk of high blood pressure include managing stress with exercise, as well as incorporating stress-reduction techniques like meditation, breathing control or yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also advised to maintain a healthy weight, and increase physical activity to at least 75 to 150 minutes each week, including cardio and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart specialists have established a PREVENT (Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs) risk calculator to estimate cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the change in hypertension prevalence among all American adults, as well as among men and women from 1999 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023, which is about the same as the prevalence in the CDC's report from 2017-2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, four in 10 adults of that percentage don't know they have the condition, the CDC said, meaning they are not receiving treatment and are therefore at much higher risk of deadly complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is a primary or contributing factor in more than 685,000 deaths each year in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings mean the government is on track to fail in its goal to bring hypertension prevalence down to 41 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence among men remained mostly unchanged from survey-to-survey and women's prevalence dropped by about one percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And between the sexes, the 2024 CDC report showed that men had a higher prevalence than women - 50.8 percent compared to 44.6 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People 18 to 39 years old had a prevalence of 23 percent. Prevalence was about 53 percent in people 40 to 59 years old and it was 72 percent in Americans 60 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphs show all cardiovascular disease risk (top), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (center) and heart failure risk (bottom) for men (right) and women (left) based on how many risk factors, which include blood pressure, medication regimen, smoking status, cholesterol level and diabetes status, a person has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While prevalence slightly decreased in the older age groups, younger age groups saw a slight rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slight increase could be a contributing factor to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13451921/strokes-rate-surge-young-people-cdc.html"&gt; the rise in strokes and cardiac events among young people&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes in Americans under 45 have risen nearly 15 percent since 2011, according to a separate report from the CDC.  The agency partly attributed the rise to an increase in high blood pressure, but also to an increase in nationwide obesity and drug addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic lists recreational drug use, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle a risk factors for hypertension. However, healthy and active people are not immune to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest CDC 2024 report found, among people with hypertension, 59 percent were aware they had the condition and about half were taking medication to lower their blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this varied widely across age groups. Just 27 percent of 18- to 39-year-olds were aware they were suffering from hypertension, compared to the 74 percent of people 60 and older who were aware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, treatment also varied. Just 14 percent of younger people were treating their hypertension compared to 69 percent of seniors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the level of treatment, however, just 21 percent of all people had their blood pressure controlled to a healthy level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows hypertension prevalence in counties across the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant change in the percent of people who were aware of, in treatment for or in control of their hypertension observed from the 2017-2021 survey and 2021-2023 survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, hypertension does not cause symptoms, which is why doctors call it a 'silent killer,' according to the Cleveland Clinic, but when blood pressure is higher than 180/120 mmHg - considered a medical emergency called a hypertensive crisis - a person may experience headaches, heart palpitations and nosebleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, high blood pressure was the primary contributor to approximately 685,900 deaths in the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high blood pressure can weaken the heart and blood vessels, which can cause cardiovascular disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13154677/young-people-having-heart-attacks-lead-seemingly-healthy-lifestyles-suffered-heart-problems.html"&gt;including sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;, and increase risk for stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat hypertension, doctors will recommend lifestyle changes, such as reaching and remaining at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, limiting alcohol, exercising and making sure to consume enough potassium, a mineral and electrolyte involved in important body processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The mom in this story is a mother of four, in her 40s, living in the Northeast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had my fourth child at 37, it was like my body completely shut down every time the word "sex" was mentioned. And I don't mean like during the fourth trimester or even while I was just breastfeeding or sleep-deprived or some other postpartum "excuse." It went like this for years. I blamed it on those &lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/know-about-sex-after-childbirth-pregnancy"&gt;postpartum hormones&lt;/a&gt;, on perimenopause, on my own anxiety. I started medication and blamed &lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/lifestyle/sex-therapist-advice"&gt;the lack of sex drive&lt;/a&gt; there, and then I started going to counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I had been together for 15 years at that point, and it really was a hard time for both of us. I didn't want to have sex, but I also didn't want to make my husband feel bad or let him down. But unlike other times, like when I was simply too tired or not in the mood, I could never rally for him. He would suggest things to try or promise me he'd add in more foreplay or use toys or do whatever I needed, but the thought of sex just still totally drained me of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a session with my therapist, I mentioned that I had looked up HSDD — &lt;a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;hypoactive sexual desire disorder&lt;/a&gt;. I told her that both my husband and I thought maybe I had it, and asked her if I should reach out to a doctor for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in that session that my therapist leaned forward and asked me to explain why I thought I wasn't interested in sex, and to not come up with some science behind it. Just answer quickly: &lt;em&gt;Why don't you want sex?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without a second thought, I said, "Because I'm not in love with my husband."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like a light bulb went off. Suddenly, all of these scenes started popping up in my head. Like coming home from the birth of our third child — our older two were only 5 and 3 at the time — and finding that I couldn't even open the laundry room door because he had piled so many dirty clothes in there. I would've given him grace as a dad who'd been at the hospital with his wife and then home with two young kids if he hadn't turned to me and said, "Yeah, nobody has any clean underwear right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recovering from a C-section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was pregnant with our fourth, I overheard him telling my father-in-law how easy this pregnancy had been. "Much easier than the last one," he said. I made eye contact with him and asked him to explain. He said, "I haven't had to do as much for you this time," and laughed it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had just quit my job so I could finally be a stay-at-home mom. He wasn't doing as much because he was coming home and napping on the couch because he was "so exhausted" from working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started clicking, and I realized that I wasn't suffering from a low sex drive; I just didn't want to have sex with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent a few more months in therapy before asking my husband to do couples therapy with me. He refused. And when I told him I thought maybe my lack of sex drive was because our marriage wasn't good, he said, "That's bullsh*t. When you want dick, you want dick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I filed for divorce a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been divorced now for two years and have had more sex than I did the last three years of our marriage. I was worried about sex post-divorce at first. What if my husband sucked &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I had some kind of sex disorder? But the first time I went on a date after my divorce, I ended up in the guy's bed and had an incredible time. My sex drive is more than OK. She's thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've had casual hook-ups and I've had more serious relationships, but through it all, I've realized how many excuses I made for my husband. I was willing to believe any kind of medical excuse — putting the entire blame on me — for my lack of sex drive before I figured out it was just him being a loser that made me feel grossed out about sex. I was willing to try creams and therapies and hormone replacements instead of just looking at the root cause of my ick: my own husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, of course, loves to talk about what a giant slut I am now. But I don't care. I'm owning that word, and I'm taking my sex life back. Because sometimes, it is the woman who just doesn't want to have sex, and it is the medication, and it is the anxiety, and the hormones, and the HSDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, it's just the sh*tty husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Scary Mommy</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 17:48:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYTdrNEpmUlNlbXRHVnBnd2JlVjJOZjh2Q1pYY0JuRWwxSl9FMFBQX0JQdzhyTmFucS1oamdLMXZuaUpPVVB2OU8zS0p5bFlMdVU5LXRqVDltOW9tWXRJd1pVQVZMekROR1JVM2hFX1A0NmttT0xPc2liYmtpNG9WZTc0MGZpUHFuZl9qNHJRRHdYWU9BdG9NWFVJUXhwcHBxVTBKNEh5OC0yRGNLSnlLM2FB</guid></item><item><title>全身核磁共振成像正在兴起--我的家族健康史促使我去做核磁共振成像。这是我学到的东西。-《东爱达荷新闻》</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/09/whole-body-mris-are-on-the-rise-and-my-family-health-history-pushed-me-to-get-one-heres-what-i-learned/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;EastIdahoNews.com reporter prepares for a whole-body MRI scan at a Prenuvo clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. | Jordan Wood, EastIdahoNews.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, Arizona — My dad had a widowmaker heart attack in his 50s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BRCA breast cancer gene runs in my mom’s family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my father survived his heart attack, and my mother hasn’t been diagnosed with cancer, but doctors have told me to keep an eye on my health, given my genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned 44 in April, and over the past year I’ve been making changes: losing weight, exercising regularly, eating smarter (and less), trying to manage stress (not easy when you work in news), and making sure I’m in bed by 10 p.m. every night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A close friend — also in his mid-40s — recently had his own wake-up call. His dad died suddenly of a stroke, and not long after, his mom was diagnosed with dementia. It shook him. He started taking better care of himself and signed up for a whole-body MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full-body scans are on the rise – attracting celebrity promoters, tech mogul investors, and waiting lists of people hoping to identify life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend told me about &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;, a company founded in 2018 that offers radiation-free MRI scans designed to detect hundreds of conditions and cancers. He said the process was simple: he booked the scan, spent an hour at the clinic, and within days, results were waiting in his inbox. His experience got me curious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prenuvo doesn’t have any clinics in Idaho, so when I found myself in Phoenix recently, I decided to try it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process was simple. I booked an appointment online, filled out a detailed health history, and fasted for a few hours before the appointment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d never had an MRI before, and to be honest, I was somewhat nervous. I get claustrophobic, and as the table slid me into the machine, I felt my chest tighten. However, Prenuvo has a nice solution: patients can watch Netflix during the scan using special glasses and headphones. It was surprisingly calming — I actually got caught up on a show I’d been meaning to watch, and it helped the time go quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table.jpg" alt="nate on table" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-775301" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-300x169.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-860x484.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-889x500.jpg 889w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton prepares for his MRI. | Jordan Wood, EastIdahoNews.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The scan itself took about an hour. Between the machine’s beeps, thumps, and taps, the technician guided me through everything via headset, even reminding me when to hold my breath. I always had a “panic button” in my hand if I needed to get out, which helped me relax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it was over, I changed back into my clothes, grabbed a few snacks waiting outside the room, and went on with my day. Three days later, the results were ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I logged into the Prenuvo site and scheduled a 40-minute virtual appointment with Dr. Vikash Modi, their Senior Medical Director of Preventive Medicine. He walked me through every detail. The scan picked up a small cyst on my kidney and liver — both benign and nothing to worry about — but otherwise, everything looked good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst.jpg" alt="kidney cyst Nate Eaton" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-775298" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-300x196.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-768x501.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-860x561.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-767x500.jpg 767w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-600x391.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A small cyst was found on Nate Eaton’s left kidney during his MRI. | Prenuvo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Modi made it clear that Prenuvo isn’t a replacement for certain screenings, like colonoscopies, and it can’t detect calcium deposits in the heart’s arteries and veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some physicians &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/18/nx-s1-5009259/full-body-scan-mri-prevention-cancer-screening"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; whether expensive full-body MRIs are necessary for people without symptoms, pointing out risks like false positives, unnecessary follow-up tests, and limited data proving the scans extend life.

However, each lab studied this question in different mice's brains, and performed slightly different behavioral tasks with each set of rodents. Once you added in uncertainties around how each research group defined distinct regions within the brain, these inconsistencies muddied the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wouldn't know whether we actually agree or disagree, because so many things were different," Carandini told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/most-detailed-human-brain-map-ever-contains-3300-cell-types" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/most-detailed-human-brain-map-ever-contains-3300-cell-types"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most detailed human brain map ever contains 3,300 cell types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZXewFsX2meZaxAmQazVt6i" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZXewFsX2meZaxAmQazVt6i slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the IBL came together to design a single, robust, standardized experiment on a scale that no individual lab could tackle alone. They then paired this megatest with precision brain measuring tools and preset analysis methods to make the results as reproducible as possible. The aim of the experiment would be to overcome an enduring obstacle in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the longest-standing challenges in neuroscience is to decipher how variation in neural systems — both structural and functional — maps onto variation in behavior," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/federico-turkheimer" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/federico-turkheimer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Federico Turkheimer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at King's College London who was not involved in the study, said in a statement to the U.K. Science Media Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project ultimately included 139 mice, spread across 12 labs around the world, that were implanted with brain-recording devices called Neuropixels probes. The probes can record up to 1,000 individual neurons simultaneously. The researchers tested the mice with a simple behavioral task that each of the dozen labs could reliably replicate: Researchers placed mice in front of a screen, and a black-and-white striped marker would flash either on the right or left. If the mice moved a small wheel in the same direction as the flash, they received a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what you'd read in a neuroscience textbook, said Carandini, you'd expect the brain activity that occurred during the experiment to follow a linear path. First, cells in the visual cortex that recognize images would fire up, followed by neurons in a different part of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, known to be involved in abstract decisions. This information might then be combined with additional activity that represented the mouse's prior experiences — in other words, memories — before being sent to motor regions of the brain that control muscle responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="2a0476d9-8c5c-4d58-b04c-d6ab6d1d520c"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The studies included data from more than 600,000 brain cells across 139 mice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Dan Birman, International Brain Laboratory)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="9f964cb6-8fb3-4fff-bcd1-cb250703e96c"&gt;The researchers' findings supported some of this chain reaction; the visual cortex was the first thing to activate, for example. Yet other findings clashed with the team's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found decision signals and signals related to the prior information in way more brain regions than we might have thought," Carandini said. Taken together, the activity across nearly all of the brain regions studied could be used to deduce whether or not the mouse had received a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some of the experimental trials, the researchers made the on-screen marker incredibly faint, so the mice essentially had to guess which way to move the wheel. The second Nature paper focused on how the mice used prior expectations — based on where the marker had been in previous tests — to inform their guess. The brain activity that flashed up when the mice guessed in these tasks was also far more widely distributed in the brain than the team anticipated it would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBL modeled its approach to understanding the brain on similar initiatives, such as the particle physics experiments conducted at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/cern" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/cern"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CERN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/complete-gapless-human-genome-sequenced" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/complete-gapless-human-genome-sequenced"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Human Genome Project's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work to understand our DNA. To describe the project's impact, Carandini reaches for yet another field: astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="515793c1-b40c-47c0-a815-e4f99f1ca98f"&gt;He noted that the earliest astronomers could look up at the night sky and see every star, but in very poor detail. With the advent of the telescope, individual celestial bodies could be explored. Previous work in neuroscience, he said, was "as if somebody had pointed a telescope only to one galaxy, and then different astronomers had pointed their telescopes at different galaxies, and said, 'My galaxy does this!' or 'No, my galaxy does that!" The new project, he explained, was like being able to view all the features of the night sky at once and up close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such work has only been possible with recent technological advances and improved collaboration across labs, but Carandini hopes that it can now be used to address other big questions about the brain. The current paper's findings are only correlational, so it is currently not possible to say whether the observed brain activity directly causes a decision to be made or is only associated with the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's the next frontier," he said, "is to add causality to the study."&lt;/p&gt;

She grew up as the eldest child in an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/i-got-all-of-my-dating-advice-from-my-evangelical-church.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;evangelical Christian family&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a mother who was often bed-bound due to health problems and a father who worked long hours outside of the house. Jordan took on child care, laundry, and other parental duties starting at age 7. She also served as her parents’ confidante, constantly kept abreast of their financial and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/couples-therapists.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;marital woes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. By the time she was a teenager, she had &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/adult-friendships-vs-kids.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lost all interest in ever becoming a parent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “I’d seen what that responsibility looks like and how it could consume your whole identity,” the 39-year-old says. She envisioned her adult life as child free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5ps001b3b78ojzkvx4g@published" data-word-count="40"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when she started dating Blake, whom she met during a college study-abroad program, she began to reconsider. Blake had grown up with a career-driven mom, and hearing about his childhood, Jordan started to envision a different model of motherhood. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5rd001c3b78vudyj0i5@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All the men I had grown up with had very limited views of what women’s roles were supposed to be, and here was this guy who had grown up admiring a mom who was at the top of her field,” says Jordan, who has two graduate degrees and works for a startup in Boston. “I had this sense of, &lt;/em&gt;I’m going to be supported for who I am, who I want to be, and I how I want to grow with this guy.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5su001d3b78bpqis0pr@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The couple married in 2015 after six years of dating. Several years later, after copious journaling, reading, therapy sessions, and consultations with friends, Jordan decided she was ready to start trying. “I decided I didn’t want fear to hold me back from something that could open up my life,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5xn001e3b78qopgnjxb@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But first, she told Blake, there was one item left on her pre-kids bucket list: She wanted to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/open-marriage-divorce.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt; open up their marriage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. She and Blake had long been candid about their sexual fantasies about other people, so Jordan said, “What if we actually tried this for real?” Blake was “immediately game,” Jordan remembers. They started seeing other people together — going to sex parties where they’d swing or have a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/how-to-arrange-three-way-with-husband.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;threesome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a woman or nonbinary person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5zt001f3b78aqm6uipr@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Initially, it was a total rocket boost for our sex life. It was really hot and we were both really into it,” Jordan says. “We even framed it as: This is our last hurrah before we have kids. Let’s go wild and crazy.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd612001g3b78mff1csew@published" data-word-count="4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what happened next. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000m0ihqkou85dof@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;At first, I thought I liked threesomes with women due to the male gaze; that it was hot to be in a situation with another woman and be observed. But it shifted for me when I realized, &lt;em&gt;I’m interested in women separate and apart from my relationship with my husband&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jdl2u001p3b788hpoo9lw@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;There was one woman in particular I had a strong attraction to. With men, I’d always needed to feel smaller to feel sexy, but with her, I was taller and I was attracted to that dynamic. That was a lightbulb moment. I thought, &lt;em&gt;I would want to hook up with her regardless, not just because we’re in this sexy circumstance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000o0ihqk3hxdz5u@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;When I told Blake I was bi, I thought I was taking this awareness in one area of my life and integrating it — making it more meaningful and giving it more texture. I thought I was strengthening our relationship by being vulnerable with him. But he was immediately fearful. He even said, “We’re going to get divorced over this.” That was really hard to hear. I felt betrayed. I had tried to be honest, but was met with fear and anger. I left for the weekend to stay with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jdy8j001x3b78nfblsezv@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;When I came back, we worked it out. He apologized and framed his response as an initial reaction that he wasn’t standing by. He said he was very supportive. So we resumed going to these parties and working through my sexuality as something that was going to be part of our lives that we’d figure out together.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000q0ihqlf1uncm1@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;About a year after I came out to Blake, I told him I was interested in dating other people — but now without him involved. He said he was as well. So we set boundaries: We could see people multiple times, but it was supposed to be casual — we weren’t supposed to be falling in love with other people or developing emotional attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600243b78oi45ho26@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;On my first date with a woman, Nora, I remember feeling nervous and hyperaware of my body. I felt very locked in with her in terms of our eye contact and easy conversation. I walked her to the train afterwards and I was like, &lt;em&gt;How do I say good-bye? &lt;/em&gt;We had a quick kiss. It was the beginning of the summer. Soon we had that new-relationship energy and I wanted to see her all of the time. I started falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600253b786ffix028@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;But that fall, Blake and I also started to try to conceive. We thought: &lt;em&gt;We’re both done with grad school, we both have good jobs, and we’re both in our mid-30s. &lt;/em&gt;We also both wanted two kids, so timing-wise, I felt like, &lt;em&gt;I need to get pregnant tomorrow.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600263b78pie2alcf@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;I knew our sex life was in a tricky stage, but we had figured out hard things before. We’d been through moves and a parent’s death and had a good track record of managing all of that. After a few months of failed attempts, I felt my conviction to become a mother intensify. Getting my period made me really sad. I realized there had been an energetic shift within me — I’d moved away from ambivalence about parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jep5g002j3b78cfdjpf4z@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;I was in a Pilates class when I heard a little voice within me say, “It’s time to go on an adventure.” So on some level I wasn’t surprised when, later that day, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I had this sense that &lt;em&gt;This is right where I want to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003l3b78hxow0tnc@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;Blake was over the moon. He insisted on coming with me to the first appointment to confirm the pregnancy. The doctor said, “Oh, there’s two little people in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003m3b78ehtisffw@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;I was shocked but also not shocked. One of my big fears around pregnancy had been feeling like I was in &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; — the body-horror aspect&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Blake had always joked that he hoped I would get pregnant with twins because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to convince me to get pregnant a second time. So my first reaction was, “You manifested this.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jevvl00303b78wtsu13cb@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;Blake and I closed our relationship during the pregnancy. I had been very honest with Nora that I was going to try to get pregnant in the fall and that Blake wasn’t supportive of how emotional our relationship had become, so she wasn’t surprised when I ended things. I didn’t let myself feel too upset about it. I just put it in the&lt;em&gt; this-is-how-it-was-always-supposed-to-be&lt;/em&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003v3b78kyrsr55u@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;I had a dream pregnancy. I had a little nausea, but not bad. I got tired more easily, but also had an ideal work-from-home situation, so it wasn’t a problem. And even though the pregnancy was high risk because of the twins and my age, it never felt stressful because I had amazing medical care through my tech job. I’d been worried I was going to feel invaded by the pregnancy, but instead I felt connected to the babies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003w3b78ye98y6bl@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;Meanwhile, Blake and I started trying to understand and digest what my relationship with Nora had meant and how we were going to move on and figure out the rules post-pregnancy. He’d told me about a few of the women he’d enjoyed dating, but he hadn’t fallen in love like I had.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003x3b78w6mgl05h@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I also wasn’t feeling very sexual, so sex wasn’t an aspect of our relationship at that point. We thought, &lt;em&gt;Let’s just focus on the pregnancy and the nesting and the excitement.&lt;/em&gt; Our relationship was good, but there was an elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jg58800443b78phqz6144@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;During a doctor’s appointment at 34 weeks, the doctors found that one of the twins wasn’t growing anymore, and sent me to the hospital to receive the first of two steroid shots. The next day I returned for the second shot and they found I was showing signs of preeclampsia — and they wouldn’t let me go home. So all of a sudden it was like, “You’re having the babies tomorrow.” When Blake and I woke up the next morning in my hospital room (he slept on a pull-out chair bed), we sang to the babies together so they could hear our voices. It was sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgbkv004b3b78pca5hot2@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;The doctor pronounced my C-section “textbook.” Giving birth was very surreal. Everything was super-smooth and the babies were healthy but very small, so they were whisked away immediately for tests before I could even hold them. An hour or so later, before I’d even had a meal, the clinicians wheeled a breast pump into my hospital room. I felt like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m just a mammal.&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t even get to hold both of them the first night because they needed to be in an incubator. It felt like I wasn’t in charge — it was the NICU nurses who were calling the shots, and I didn’t mind that so much, but in retrospect, I was a little bit sad about it. But I was sad about everything for a while because one baby came home a couple of days before the other baby. When one was in the NICU and one was home, I was just a mess.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgnvb004o3b78deg7keqp@published" data-word-count="205"&gt;In the initial weeks after they were born, it was all hands on deck — figuring out sleep and feeding schedules and getting help. It was very hard for me to bond with the twins, because I was tied to a very grueling schedule: pumping and then feeding one (with a mix of breast milk and formula, as suggested by our pediatrician) and then feeding the other (with that same mix) and then pumping again. I’d put them down to sleep and start all over. It was a blur and felt very mechanical. Plus, about six weeks into my leave, I got laid off. I had guessed that it was coming — my company had recently been acquired — and in a way, it was a good thing, because I had been itching to leave this job for a while and had only stayed because I had great health insurance. I was worried about finding a new job as a mom, but I’m also accustomed to this kind of thing. I’m an elder millennial who entered the workforce in a recession. And most importantly, I was able to negotiate a good severance package: an additional four months of pay on top of my maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgtet004v3b78m2sxra7t@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Blake was incredibly supportive through that whole process, encouraging me to find a new job that I’d like better than the old one that I’d outgrown. Our strength as a couple was figuring out all of these logistics. It was easy for us to do that and not really emotionally connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004w3b78w9t0sut5@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;About three months after the twins were born, Blake returned to work and I stopped pumping. That’s when my schedule finally opened up and I was able to spend more relaxed time with the twins. I started taking them on long walks and meeting up with other moms. That felt really good, and it boosted my confidence. I was starting to bond with the twins at that point — just by being able to hold them and snuggle them more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004x3b78pymqtiot@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;Blake and I also stayed very focused on seeing friends and family. One of my favorite memories is hosting Thanksgiving that first year with longtime friends. It was the first time we had hosted that holiday rather than being guests. It felt like we were establishing our own family traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhcwr005a3b784pky0o6u@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;When the twins were 8 or 9 months old, we visited my parents. Blake and I had always agreed that I was never going to come out to my family or his family. He also had a Christian upbringing. But during this particular visit, I was struck by the fact that being closeted with my family meant I couldn’t truly be out to my kids. And if I was closeted to them, what would that mean if they ever wanted to come out themselves? I felt like a hypocrite — hiding myself but expecting my children to be comfortable with whomever they turned out to be. Simultaneously, I had the realization that I couldn’t be honest with Blake about how I was feeling since he’d always been adamant that my sexuality should be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005h3b78cakzu1f2@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I really started feeling this alarm in my head going off all the time. Whenever I had a moment where I wasn’t taking care of my kids or trying to find a job or actively busy, my inner self was a five-alarm fire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005i3b78foevjtlm@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;I tried to have conversations with Blake, but he resisted acknowledging that we were in a crisis. After a couple months, I said, “I don’t quite know what to do here. I feel like I have to start to consider divorce.” That got his attention. We both started doing individual therapy and couples therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj78005j3b78igq6h751@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;Our biggest issue was my bisexuality: Blake didn’t think it was possible for me to come out to our families without &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; outing us as nonmonogamous. He knew they viewed that as very taboo, and he wasn’t willing to have that confrontation. That felt invalidating to me. Our inability to be vulnerable and emotionally connect in this one area kind of spread throughout the whole relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj78005k3b787l826fdv@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;We found we were in a reinforcing loop that locked us into miscommunication and disconnection, and each of our bids to break out of that cycle failed to land with the other person. It was heartbreaking, but we finally decided that we weren’t going to be able to figure it out. We needed to get divorced.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jht5j005x3b78xyojx4mw@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;About six months after I started a new job, when the twins were almost 18 months old, I told my parents about the divorce and then went to visit them a few weeks later. They didn’t acknowledge the divorce. I felt isolated and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhyox00643b78gmobht1b@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;When I came home, I wrote them an email. I came out to them as bisexual and said I needed a break from talking to them so they could digest the news. Three months later, I got on a video call with my parents and siblings. They said they love me even though they don’t agree with my “lifestyle.” In other words, they still think I’m going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhyoy00653b785k6bm0op@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I told them I couldn’t remain in a relationship with them like that — that’s not my definition of love. Since then, my parents haven’t tried to reach out to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4ji95g006i3b787251vpc3@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;About three months after deciding to divorce, Blake and I found a second apartment. We started bird-nesting right away, which is a way of co-parenting where the kids stay in the same home all the time and the parents switch back and forth between the two homes they share. It was really disorienting at first. I would jerk awake not sure where I was, thinking I was hearing my kids crying even when they weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jiskj006w3b78tmfycxyy@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;I never got back with Nora because she had moved to another city. But I did reach out to another woman I’d dated around the same time. We are now in an open relationship, and I’m deeply in love with her. I’m not dating other people right now because there’s a lot on my plate, but I don’t necessarily see myself being in a monogamous relationship ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jiyiz00733b781sy7l9pi@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;It might sound weird for someone to say they were in their 30s before they realized who they were attracted to. I had always had these emotionally rich, intimate relationships with women. And I also always thought that everyone just acknowledged that women were more beautiful than men. In retrospect, maybe I should have put those two pieces together earlier. But because of how I was raised and how early I got together with Blake, I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jj6ln007n3b78xo9mob5x@published" data-word-count="32"&gt;The twins turned 3 this summer. I haven’t introduced them to my girlfriend, who I’ve been with for a little over a year, because I want to take things slow on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jjj5e007v3b78d0gf29mk@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;I’m proud of Blake and me. It hasn’t always been easy, but we’ve put our ability to handle difficult situations and be on the same team to use. Our bird-nesting arrangement is still going strong. We’re embedded in each other’s day-to-day lives in terms of groceries and laundry and rent pay. Our custody is 50-50 too. He is a wonderful dad and a really good co-parent, even though we parent differently. I really hope he’s happy romantically, but he keeps that information to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

I was &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-evangelical-obsession-with-corporal-punishment.html"&gt;spanked regularly as a child&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m definitely not doing any physical correction with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jjzc9008f3b780owslfyv@published" data-word-count="111"&gt;Beyond that, I’m doing gentle parenting — not in terms of permissiveness, but in terms of acknowledging feelings. When I was growing up, I felt I couldn’t reveal anything I was struggling with. And when I did, it became a running joke in the family. I got a lot of messages very early on that my emotional interior state was not something that there was space for. So I’m really trying to give space for what my kids feel. Toddlers have a lot of big feelings. My mantra with them is: Be brave, be curious, and be kind. When I see that behavior in them, I try to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jjzc9008g3b78yocsyf4e@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;I’m thinking a lot about how I’ll introduce my bisexuality to my children in the future. I want them to know they can be exactly who they are. I also have gratitude for them. Coming out to my family was something I did for my kids — I never would have done it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jkabv008t3b784a8zwru4@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;Before I had kids, I had very low expectations for the infant and toddler phase — I was more interested in what it would be like once they could communicate. But it’s surprising and humbling how much you can communicate with a little nonverbal creature. The bond that I was afraid wouldn’t develop actually did without me having to force it.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is reportedly planning to add seven new members to the Centers for Disease Control’s vaccine advisory panel, including known vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, physician and writer Jeremy Faust &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-rfk-jr-seeks-to-rush-7-new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the list of potential new members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, in his newsletter, Inside Medicine, with other sources seeming to confirm its authenticity. Among the names on the list are several researchers and clinicians who have misrepresented the scientific consensus around vaccinations, or otherwise questioned their use. The panel’s purpose is to act as an independent adviser to the CDC, and its recommendations help steer vaccine policy, as well as insurance coverage for jabs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;News of the list comes after Kennedy fired the panel’s members in June and installed his own picks, causing concern among public health experts and lawmakers alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee Thursday, Kennedy deflected criticisms of his ACIP picks. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) noted that several of Kennedy’s current ACIP members have received money from testifying in vaccine-related lawsuits. Cassidy argued that this history constituted a financial conflict of interest—the same rationale Kennedy used to dismiss the old ACIP members. Kennedy disagreed entirely, instead claiming that someone being paid to testify against vaccines was merely evidence of them potentially having a bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s first vaccine target&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early June, Kennedy unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, citing conflicts of interest despite significant vetting and disclosure processes. He then quickly restocked the panel with several ideological allies, some of whom have a record of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; vaccine safety by citing widely criticized research, or who have &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/fda/two-of-kennedys-new-acip-picks-were-paid-expert-witnesses-in-merck-vaccine-cases"&gt;financially benefited&lt;/a&gt; from testifying against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that month, the new but still short-staffed ACIP &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; the removal of an additive called thimerosal that contains mercury from the very few remaining vaccines that contain it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccination proponents have long blamed thimerosal in vaccines for causing autism and neurological problems, but a mountain of studies over the past two decades have failed to find any such connection, and it is widely considered to be safe. Regardless, Kennedy and the HHS &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; the panel’s recommendation in July.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Stacking the deck&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, Kennedy appears to have picked who will fill the remaining seats on the panel. At least half of the reported new selections appear to have some bias against at least one vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the names on the list is Joseph Fraiman. An emergency medicine specialist in New Orleans, he has authored &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X22010283?via%3Dihub"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.18.25329352v1"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; claiming to show the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines caused more serious adverse effects than commonly believed. At an event led by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in late 2022, Fraiman even &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/12/scicheck-desantis-dubious-covid-19-vaccine-claims/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccines were not safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, many other scientists have &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67E0F21A314339B377BB5DC412A4A8"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; Fraiman’s research and methodology, and the vast majority of studies have reaffirmed the safety and life-saving benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another person on the list is pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan, who has also attacked the COVID-19 vaccines and testified in a 2024 congressional hearing on vaccine injuries &lt;a href="https://greene.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=60"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Milhoan’s also a senior fellow at Independent Medical Alliance, a group that has &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fringe-doctors-groups-promote-ivermectin-for-covid-despite-a-lack-of-evidence/"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; dubious treatments for the coronavirus and questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Also named is John Gaitanis, a pediatric neurologist who has &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cofc-1_19-vv-00795/pdf/USCOURTS-cofc-1_19-vv-00795-0.pdf"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; as an paid expert witness in a specialized federal vaccine court on behalf of people who believe they or their children were harmed by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so is Catherine Stein, a tuberculosis expert at Case Western Reserve University who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;previously called&lt;/a&gt; for an end to COVID-19 vaccine mandates at universities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy also seems to have tried eliminating pro-vaccine voices from elsewhere in the government.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, a former ACIP member, and outspoken Kennedy critic, was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/02/health/offit-fda-vrbpac"&gt;reportedly barred&lt;/a&gt; from further participation on the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee. Offit claims he was offered an extension of his current term by FDA officials until 2027, but that this extension was overturned by HHS without any explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grim outlook ahead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is set to meet later this month, when it is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/acip-review-covid-hep-b-and-mmrv-vaccine-recommendations-september-meeting"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to weigh in on several issues that could have widespread implications for vaccine access moving forward. The panel will discuss and potentially offer recommendations on the COVID-19 vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine, and the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Several members of Congress have called for the meeting to be delayed, including GOP members &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures"&gt;previously supportive&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy’s nomination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, it takes months of vetting before prospective new members are formally added to the ACIP, so it’s not clear whether the people on the possible additions list will be part of that meeting. It’s also unclear whether the vetting and disclosure process for ACIP members will change as a result of these moves, or how it might affect vaccine policy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the Senate hearing on Thursday, Sen. Cassidy said Kennedy appeared to be disrupting access to vaccines through his actions as health secretary—an accusation Kennedy denied. The health secretary also repeatedly criticized the CDC for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Kennedy seems as committed as ever to pushing forward his agenda, even as his decisions &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;fueled the collapse&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s senior leadership last week. And without a drastic change of course, it seems unlikely that Kennedy and the new ACIP will be deterred.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My dad started wearing baseball caps to breakfast. This should have been my first clue that something was wrong—the man who taught me that hats indoors were disrespectful was suddenly treating our kitchen like a stadium. When I finally saw him hatless, I understood: his crown looked like a helicopter landing pad, surrounded by increasingly creative swirls of denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a two-year journey through every hair loss "solution" marketed to desperate boomers with disposable income and dial-up levels of internet skepticism. He fell for every testimonial featuring a distinguished gentleman his age who'd supposedly regrown the hairline of a 30-year-old. The real tragedy wasn't the thousands he spent—it was watching him make his situation worse while actual solutions sat untouched in his medicine cabinet, too boring to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The aggressive scalp massage oils his barber sold him&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every boomer barbershop now pushes "stimulating" oils that promise to "reactivate dormant follicles." My dad bought the whole line—tea tree, eucalyptus, something called "masculine mint." He'd massage his scalp like he was tenderizing meat, convinced that harder meant better. But aggressive massage actually increases hair shedding through mechanical stress, especially in aging follicles that are already hanging on by a thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Gentle application of minoxidil, available at any drugstore without the barbershop markup. It's unsexy, it's been around since the '80s, but it actually works for about 60% of users. My dad dismissed it as "that old stuff" while paying $80 for oils that smelled like a cough drop factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The vitamin megadoses from late-night infomercials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started taking supplements sold by silver-haired men who looked suspiciously full-maned for their age. Biotin, saw palmetto, mysterious "proprietary blends" that required signing up for monthly shipments. But megadosing vitamins without deficiency can interfere with blood tests and mask real health issues—dangerous for boomers who actually need accurate health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Getting actual blood work done. When my dad finally saw a real doctor, he discovered low vitamin D and borderline thyroid issues—both fixable and actually related to his hair loss. The $300 monthly supplement subscription had been masking real problems with expensive placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. The military-grade buzz cut to 'strengthen' remaining hair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some genius at his gym convinced him that cutting hair super short would make it "grow back stronger." So my dad, who'd worn the same businessman's cut since 1985, suddenly looked like he was reporting for basic training. But traumatic cuts can actually shock follicles into premature resting phase, especially in older scalps. He literally scared his own hair away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Maintaining a consistent, gentle grooming routine. Regular trims, yes. Shocking your 68-year-old follicles with dramatic changes, no. Hair doesn't "strengthen" from being cut—that's like thinking your arm gets stronger from amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. The testosterone supplements from his men's health magazine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every boomer men's magazine runs ads for "natural T-boosters" featuring jacked grandpas. My dad ordered pills that promised to restore his "masculine vitality" and, by extension, his hairline. Plot twist: boosting testosterone can actually accelerate male pattern baldness by increasing DHT, the actual hormone destroying his follicles. He was literally fueling his own baldness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Finasteride, which blocks DHT formation. Yes, it requires a prescription. Yes, he'd heard rumors about side effects from his golf buddies. But it's one of only two FDA-approved treatments that actually addresses the cause, not the symptom. His fear of side effects was keeping him from the one thing that might actually help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The constant hat-wearing that became his security blanket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He owned seventeen baseball caps. Boat caps. Golf visors. Even a fedora he thought was "classy." He wore them everywhere—restaurants, family photos, probably in the shower. But constant hat-wearing causes traction alopecia from pressure and friction, plus creates a moist environment perfect for scalp problems. His security blanket was slowly strangling his remaining follicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Scalp sunscreen when outside, and otherwise letting his head breathe. When he finally ditched the caps, his scalp health improved within weeks. Turns out follicles appreciate oxygen more than concealment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. The laser helmet that cost more than my first car&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent $3,500 on a helmet that made him look like Darth Vader's accountant. He'd sit watching Fox News while wearing this monstrosity, convinced he could feel it "working." While laser therapy has limited evidence, consumer devices are usually too weak compared to clinical versions. He'd bought the hair loss equivalent of a very expensive nightlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: That money could have paid for years of proven treatments or consultations with an actual dermatologist. Or even clinical-grade laser therapy that actually has proper wavelengths and power. But that would mean admitting he'd been scammed, and boomer pride doesn't allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. The 'ancient Chinese herbs' from Facebook ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook knows exactly how to target desperate boomers: fake news sites, stolen doctor photos, and promises of "what doctors don't want you to know." He ordered mysterious pills from websites that looked like they were designed in 1998. These unregulated supplements can contain anything from sawdust to actual pharmaceuticals in dangerous doses. He was playing Russian roulette with sketchy internet pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: FDA-approved treatments from legitimate pharmacies. Boring? Yes. Safe? Also yes. But safety doesn't come with testimonials from "Dr. Chen from Beijing" who discovered this "one weird trick."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. The complete shampoo elimination after reading health blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some wellness blogger convinced him that shampoo was a Big Soap conspiracy. He went "no-poo," certain his natural oils would revive his follicles like some biblical miracle. Three months later, his scalp was a disaster of buildup and inflammation. Turns out scalps need basic hygiene, especially aging scalps dealing with changing oil production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually works: Gentle cleansing 2-3 times weekly, plus ketoconazole shampoo once a week. It's an antifungal that actually reduces scalp DHT. Available at any pharmacy, no conspiracy theories required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching my dad fight his hair loss was like watching someone try to negotiate with time itself. Every cure he tried was really just elaborate denial—if he threw enough money and effort at it, maybe he could trick biology into reversing course. The supplements, the devices, the oils—they were all just expensive ways to avoid saying the words "I'm going bald."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saddest part? The things that actually work—minoxidil, finasteride, proper nutrition, stress management—sat ignored because they seemed too simple. He wanted a battle, a transformation, a comeback story. What he got instead was gradual acceptance and a lot of empty bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he stopped wearing hats. Not because his hair grew back, but because he got tired of hiding. He keeps his remaining hair short and neat, uses the boring treatments that actually help a little, and jokes about his "solar panel for a sex machine." The cure he was looking for was never in a bottle—it was in letting go of the idea that baldness was something that needed curing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His bathroom cabinet is still full of failed experiments, monuments to hope over evidence. But at least he's stopped adding to the collection. These days, when he sees a Facebook ad for hair restoration miracles, he just laughs and keeps scrolling. That might be the real cure after all: the wisdom to know when you've lost, and the grace to stop making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

And nearly 18million use it daily or near daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But because marijuana boosts levels of certain enzymes in the liver, those who take the drug regularly may also break down anesthetics, both the kind used for sedation during medical treatments and over-the-counter painkillers, much faster, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana also interferes with the same system in the brain as anesthetics, which can also make the sedation-inducing drugs less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the drugs are less effective, people could wake up during surgery, which poses dangers because it could prompt muscles to move suddenly, increasing the risk of injury, and cause psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than people who do not take the drug in order to ensure that their anesthetics are effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above picture shows a woman receiving anesthetic in a hospital (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors urge patients to alert their physicians whether they smoke, vape, or consume marijuana as edibles, since all can affect their response to anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who have previously woken up during surgery have described it as 'terrifying' and causing them significant distress from seeing their body cut open, leading to regular nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But patients do not experience pain, reports suggest, with their nerves still remaining numbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sood shared the advice online in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorsood/video/7543620531510054157"&gt;clip on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that has gone viral and received 2.1million views and more than 185,000 likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It showed the Maryland physician with the phrase across the top of the video: 'Did you know if you do cannabis long-term you will require a higher dose of anesthesia to achieve the same effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Make sure you tell your anesthesiologist if you smoke or consume cannabis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were quick to respond to the post, with many praising the doctor for raising awareness and some self-described marijuana smokers saying they had woken up during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient wrote, 'Yup, woke up during my colonoscopy [due to this]. Horrible feeling.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors said edibles posed the greatest risk to patients because their effects are longer lasting (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several also said they had woken up during wisdom teeth removals, which they thought was due to their cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some patients also said they had told their doctor about their marijuana use but had been told 'not to worry'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'I told them that before surgery and they said that's not real', while a second said, 'I&lt;span&gt; asked my anesthesiologist before my surgery. He told me I watch too much TV and to not be worried'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kunal Sood, pictured, raised awareness over the complication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that edibles have the greatest effect on anesthetics because these are longer-lasting and can be released from the intestines for hours after consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect of marijuana that is smoked or vaped typically lasts just one to three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are also advised to tell doctors the strength of the marijuana's THC, the ingredient in the drug that produces the high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians will not judge patients for cannabis use, the society said, and will not share the information outside of their medical team. It will only be used to ensure a patient receives the right amount of anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alerting doctors to this would ensure patients avoid unintended hospital admissions after surgery, longer hospital stays or readmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is not clear how many patients wake up during surgery in the US due to marijuana, but it may be in the thousands, with between 40 and 50million surgeries completed in the country every year. And 17.7million Americans describe themselves as habitual pot users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2020/10/cannabis-and-postoperative-pain"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that people who used marijuana before surgery required 50 percent more anesthetic than those who did not use the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/marijuana-and-anesthesia-why-tell-your-doctor-about-your-use/"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have even suggested marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Jiff Zafar, an anesthesiologist at Yale, said previously on the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/what-to-tell-your-anesthesiologist-before-surgery"&gt;Yale University website&lt;/a&gt;: 'We want patients to tell us what form of marijuana, and how much, they are using, so we can understand the potency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This is important because it can affect how well the anesthesia works. You may actually have more of a tolerance to anesthesia, which means you need more of it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American Society of Anesthesiologists tells people to avoid marijuana from midnight the day before surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They warn the drug can raise heart rate and blood pressure, putting further strain onto the cardiovascular system alongside anesthetics that can cause a surgery-related heart attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After surgery, the experts also recommended that people avoid the drug to ensure they recover correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have created a remarkable new approach to repairing spinal cord injuries by merging 3D printing, stem cells, and lab-grown tissues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They engineered tiny scaffolds that guide stem cells to form nerve fibers capable of bridging severed spinal cords. In experiments with rats, this method restored nerve connections and movement, offering new hope that one day similar techniques could help people living with paralysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, scientists at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities have successfully combined 3D printing, stem cell science, and lab-grown tissues to explore a new approach for treating spinal cord injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the work appear in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injuries affect more than 300,000 people in the United States, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center. There is still no treatment that can fully reverse the paralysis and long-term damage these injuries cause. One of the biggest barriers to recovery is that nerve cells die, and the remaining fibers cannot regrow across the site of injury. The Minnesota team designed their study to directly address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3D-Printed Scaffolds and Stem Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a specialized 3D-printed structure known as an organoid scaffold. This tiny framework contains microscopic channels that are filled with spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs). These cells, which originate from human adult stem cells, can divide and develop into specific types of mature nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We use the 3D printed channels of the scaffold to direct the growth of the stem cells, which ensures the new nerve fibers grow in the desired way,” said Guebum Han, a former University of Minnesota mechanical engineering postdoctoral researcher and first author on the paper who currently works at Intel Corporation. “This method creates a relay system that when placed in the spinal cord bypasses the damaged area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Successful Transplants in Animal Models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. The cells successfully differentiated into neurons and extended their nerve fibers in both directions—rostral (toward the head) and caudal (toward the tail)—to form new connections with the host’s existing nerve circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new nerve cells integrated seamlessly into the host spinal cord tissue over time, leading to significant functional recovery in the rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Toward Future Clinical Translation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research,” said Ann Parr, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. “Our laboratory is excited to explore the future potential of our ‘mini spinal cords’ for clinical translation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The 59-year-old Melville, New York, resident knew he faced a higher risk of heart disease because of blood pressure that remained high despite medications and a family history of cardiac problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malin thought he’d covered all the bases. But at a visit with his primary care doctor in early 2023, the grandfather of one mentioned a new development — dull, come-and-go pain in his left shoulder and arm when exercising. He soon found himself getting an electrocardiogram (EKG) to gauge his heart’s electrical activity and an exercise stress test with nuclear imaging. &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Jeffrey Kuvin, M.D., looked at Malin’s risk factors, symptoms and test results and quickly set up a coronary angiogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A window into a widowmaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results made the scope of Malin’s heart problem stunningly clear: He had a 99% blockage of his left anterior descending (LAD) artery. A heart attack originating in the LAD is sometimes called a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/widow-maker-heart-attack-treated-with-therox" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“widowmaker”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“widowmaker”&lt;/a&gt; because the artery plays such a key role in supplying blood to the heart. The interventional cardiology team fixed the problem on the spot, inserting a mesh stent in Malin’s LAD to prop it open. Six hours later, Malin went home, healthy, grateful and ready to adopt the medications and lifestyle changes his doctors advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got pictures of my heart that clearly show the before and the after,” says Malin. “It’s very alarming how close I was to a tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was able to avoid a major — and perhaps life-ending — heart attack,” agrees Dr. Kuvin, senior vice president of cardiology at Northwell Health and co-director of the Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital. “It speaks to the importance of picking the right test for the right patient at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Communication points the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when it comes to a heart check-up, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all checklist. The most crucial factor is a frank conversation with your care provider. “There are a number of factors that go into choosing the appropriate tests,” explains Dr. Kuvin, who is the health system's Lorinda and Vincent de Roulet Professor of Medicine. “Everyone’s on their own path, and the clinician’s analysis can determine whether certain tests might be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Difference-making cardiac tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the tests your doctor might recommend — and how can they help you stay healthy? Here are some examples, and what they can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cardiac MRI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; To get detailed information about your heart function, including the texture of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a platform that slides into an MRI machine. Often, dye is injected through an IV to help produce refined images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The size of the heart and its pumping power, damage or scarring from a previous heart attack or disease, heart valve function and other cardiac conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chest x-ray&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you have chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; While standing, you’ll be positioned between an X-ray machine and a plate that creates an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It provides a good view of the entire chest cavity and can give us information about the size of the heart and how it functions in relation to the lungs,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary angiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re having new or worsening symptoms suggestive of heart disease or received abnormal test results that require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; A flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in your wrist or groin and threaded to the coronary arteries in your heart. Dye is injected to make it easier to get a detailed view of blood vessels on an X-ray image called an angiogram. You’ll likely get a light sedative to help you relax. As with Malin, results might lead to the immediate placement of a stent; a short hospital stay may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; It can detect restricted blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; It can show whether there’s hardened plaque in the coronary arteries, which indicates a higher risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a table that slides into a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/imaging/services/cardiac-ct" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CT scanner.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CT scanner.&lt;/a&gt; Electrodes on your chest connect to a device that records heart activity and allows images of the coronary arteries to be taken between heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; Levels of calcium-containing plaque in arteries that can restrict blood flow to your heart. Results can determine if you need medication or lifestyle changes to reduce your heart attack risk. The test isn’t appropriate for someone with active heart symptoms, such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary CT angiography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it&lt;/strong&gt;: You have symptoms suggesting heart disease or have received abnormal results from other heart tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ll lie on a table that slides into a CT scanner. An IV will inject contrast dye that will help blood vessels show up better on CT images. Chest electrodes will also record heart rate. You might require medication to slow your heartbeat so the images are clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows&lt;/strong&gt;: Detailed images of the arteries can detect abnormalities in blood flow, show areas of plaque buildup and pinpoint areas in need of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Echocardiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You have symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort or palpitations; you had a heart attack; or you may have heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; An ultrasound probe on your chest will bounce or “echo” sonogram waves off heart structures, showing moving images of heart walls and valves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It’s a great window into the heart,” Dr. Kuvin says. “We can see how the heart is functioning, including the muscle, valves and surrounding tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Electrocardiogram (EKG)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you’re having symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Electrodes and wire leads will be placed on your chest, arms and legs. The leads are attached to an electrocardiograph machine that records your heart’s electrical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The electric impulses of the heart and whether you’re having abnormal heart rhythms; it can also reveal a history of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should you see a cardiologist?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people across the world. Seeing a cardiologist can make all the difference, but sometimes people don’t realize they should make an appointment, says Dr. Kuvin. ”We have advanced technologies that allow us to diagnose and treat heart conditions and improve and prolong life,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons to make an appointment with a cardiology provider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort (which may include pain in the arm, neck, jaw or back), palpitations or flutters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure or cholesterol that’s not responding to treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise intolerance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes or diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizzy spells or fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family history of early-onset or major cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications during pregnancy, including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia or eclampsia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy or other cancer treatments, such as radiation or immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease or other systemic inflammatory diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of smoking or obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genetic condition known to raise the risk of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/insights/heart-checkup-9-tests-that-can-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9Ga2VhaHNLMjJCX2lBLWZCM2ljRDI2anJLZnlOV2RBdUpuWnNCX3pCcVBPeFpETTFsRWF5bkQwTTc0b0FLaUI5Wkctem1RYVZabkFrUGE2aHRCTlN1</guid></item><item><title>家庭建议：我的争吵姻亲不可能在身边。现在他们毁了我女儿的生日派对。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-bickering-in-laws.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqqk000i3b79603jydu6@published"&gt;My husband’s parents get along about as well as oil and water, but last weekend their bickering caused a major upset for our 6-year-old daughter “Alicia,” ruining her birthday party at our local kids’ fun center/arcade.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5f82zn000x3b7933ivl7n1@published"&gt;My father-in-law went to get another piece of cake, and my mother-in-law criticized him and made a snide remark about his weight. This ignited an argument that escalated to a shouting match, which culminated in her dumping a cup of soda on his head. They did this right in front of Alicia, her friends, cousins, and no small number of other parents who were there with their own children. The staff ended up asking my in-laws to leave. Alicia was left in tears and asked why her grandparents are always mean to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqsp000j3b795h52u04h@published"&gt;I want to impose a six-month timeout on my in-laws visiting with the condition that they either get into some kind of anger management or from now on they will have to take turns coming over individually. My husband thinks this is too much to ask; he says his parents have “always been like this” and to let it go. I don’t think it’s asking too much to shield my daughter from their dysfunction because two people in their 60s can’t behave like adults for a few hours. This is a perfectly reasonable position, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqy4000m3b79jhzk90b0@published"&gt;It’s a fact that a solid quarter of the questions this advice column receives wouldn’t need to be asked if people stopped dismissing their spouses’ legitimate concerns and held their own parents accountable for the wild things they’ve done. But it is also true that some people in more volatile families learn to survive or cope by keeping their heads down, and I really do understand that, to a point. While I don’t think you need to just ignore what happened at the Fun Zone, as your husband seems to be suggesting, I read a lot of experience and resignation (and maybe hopelessness) in his comment about how his parents have “always been like this.” He has probably had to let a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things go just to stay sane and in a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr02000n3b79dva7l0ju@published"&gt;Your expectations regarding your in-laws’ behavior seem totally reasonable to me. But sometimes there’s a lot of daylight between “reasonable” and “realistic.” Your husband’s parents have been sniping at each other all their lives. And some people are just not going to deal with their anger issues or go to therapy, no matter what you say to them. Some parents also refuse to listen to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; criticism from their own children, even when those children are fully grown and 100 percent correct. I don’t know if your in-laws are reachable on this—they may well be! That would be great. But it is often impossible to get people to change, even when they should.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr27000o3b79aif5stzr@published"&gt;You and your spouse cannot control how his parents choose to behave. You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;decide who your family sees and spends time with, and how, and how often. If you personally need a break from your in-laws, that’s fine. If you strongly feel that your child needs to be “shielded” from her grandparents’ terrible behavior, that is also something you and your husband can discuss and figure out how to address. You can’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; your in-laws to change, but you can make suggestions (like anger management therapy), attempt to establish some rules for the time they spend with their granddaughter, or even insist on separate visits, as you suggested. The next time they cross a line, you and your family can also just leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr3x000p3b79x3rq02dr@published"&gt;I’m not making any excuses for your in-laws’ treatment of each other, which would also drive me up the wall. And I’m not saying that you have to just tolerate their particular brand of dysfunction. But you cannot hope to shield your child from all dysfunctional behavior forever. She’s already seen some things, and she will notice more and more as she gets older.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr5r000q3b79o72x7o31@published"&gt;Given all that, I think maybe the most important thing you can do, as a parent, is talk with her honestly about what she’s seeing and experiencing. Ask how she feels about what happened at the Fun Zone, or at other times with your family. Don’t pretend like everything is okay, or that certain behaviors are acceptable when they’re not. Make sure your child knows she can always share what she’s thinking or feeling with you. As she gets older, she, too, will have decisions to make about what she thinks is right, what sort of boundaries she needs, and what she’s willing to tolerate for the sake of relationships she cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

This was often painful for me, and I frequently felt like an odd duck. I grew up to be a still introverted but more outgoing adult. I have only a few close friends, but those friendships are rewarding and I’m generally a content person.

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian Randall “Bash” Williams, of Wellington, was taken from us tragically on Monday, September 1, 2025 at the age of 19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian was born the son of Brett Williams and Crystal Hill on July 11, 2006 in Wichita.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A charismatic and dedicated soul,  Bash could always be found with a sly grin that was his signature. He lived a life of loyalty, supportiveness, and energy that was as infectious as his smile. Sabastian was a young entrepreneur with an unwavering spirit of determination. He was a supportive friend, a dependable family member, and an individual who radiated respect and trustworthiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="more-105612"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;His love for cooking was notable, as he harbored dreams of becoming a chef one day. His other passions included music, collecting shoes, and the sanctuary of video games. Bash’s personality was as warm as a Kansas summer; his presence was like a melody that resonated within people’s hearts, leaving an indelible imprint. His love for hoodies was a testament to his laid-back style and a reflection of his easy-going nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;He will be remembered for his charisma, dedication, loyalty, and the unwavering support he offered to those around him. His memory will live on in the hearts of those he touched, as will his infectious grin and his love for life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian is survived by his father, Brett Williams; mother, Crystal Hill (John); sister, Chenoa Williams (Hunter); brother, Sullivan Williams; nephew, August Cowherd; and grandparents, Randy Williams (Dianna); and Lisa Moore who will forever cherish their memories with him. His absence will be profoundly felt, yet his spirit will continue to flourish in their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A viewing for Sabastian will be held on Friday, September 5, 2025, from 1 to 7 p.m., with family present from 5 to 7 p.m. at Cornejo Funeral Home &amp;amp; Crematory, 1030 Mission Road, Wellington, 67152. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Red meat, processed foods, and sweets are kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While variations of the Mediterranean diet have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;linked to reduced dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; before, a team led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that it could be especially protective for people with two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; gene variant, almost acting as a countermeasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-diets-can-slash-cancer-risk-by-up-to-45-large-study-finds"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Can Slash Cancer Risk by Up to 45%, Large Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.1668"&gt;in a randomized trial&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Yuxi Liu, from the Harvard Chan School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a complex condition, with risk factors known to include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-tea-and-a-vitamin-supplement-could-protect-against-alzheimers"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. There's also a genetic element, because having one or two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene significantly increases the chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;getting the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the Mediterranean diet in people with specific genetic backgrounds, while also analyzing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;blood metabolites&lt;/a&gt;: molecules that can act as indicators of how the body is functioning and processing food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg" alt="Study design" class="wp-image-173023 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study combined data on diet, cognition, and genetics.

This could give us a greater understanding of how Alzheimer's risk factors influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association is significant, the findings are based on well-educated individuals of European ancestry, and don't show direct cause and effect, suggesting there may be unknown factors having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the metabolite markers were only measured once, so the researchers don't have a full picture of how diet or the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-in-younger-people-is-often-overlooked-here-are-5-key-reasons"&gt;symptoms of dementia&lt;/a&gt; might have changed them over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, metabolite markers might be used to evaluate dementia risk and to target specific biological pathways for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03891-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In a small 2025 study published in the journal Biomolecules, 37 healthy people consumed 37 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil a day for 100 days. Blood and fecal tests showed that multiple markers of inflammation had decreased compared with pre-study levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91" data-toc-id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91"&gt;Kefir or live yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A healthy gut microbiome containing "good" microbes is thought to lower markers of inflammation, according to a 2020 review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-fermented-foods-ex-noma-chef-has-in-fridge-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; such as kefir and live yogurts typically contain prebiotics — fiber that promotes "good" bacteria — and probiotics — or gut-friendly bugs — which make the gut microbiome more diverse and release helpful molecules. Buckley usually has one of the two for breakfast with some oats, milled chia seeds, and frozen berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some emerging evidence that fermented foods may reduce inflammation, too, Buckley said. A 2021 study published in the journal Nutrients found that of the 1,753 people involved, those who ate yogurt had lower levels of two markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11" data-toc-id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11"&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foods containing omega-3 fatty acids — such as oily fish like salmon, sardines, and trout — have anti-inflammatory properties, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 rich foods are thought to lower the risk of heart disease, which is partly why the American Heart Association recommends eating fish (particularly the oily kind) twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests it could decrease the risk of abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to sudden death, lower triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood, and slow the growth of fatty deposits that clog arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley likes to grill hers, season it with lots of extra virgin olive oil, lemon, and fresh herbs, which she keeps in the freezer, and pair it with a salad and rice or potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
