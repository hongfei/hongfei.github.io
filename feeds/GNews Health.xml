			&lt;p&gt;Cases of the fungal infection &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_auris"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are rising rapidly and coming from more sources too, a new US study reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; was first reported in the US &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-drug-resistant-fungus-has-arrived-in-the-us"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and is considered an "urgent antimicrobial resistance threat" in hospitals, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a large health system in Miami, Florida, the new research found that reported clinical cases had risen from 5 in 2019 to 115 in 2023 – a considerable jump of 2,200 percent in four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consistent with US national trends, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rapidly spread in our community as noted by a sharp increase in the identification of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; from clinical cultures in 2020 and 2021, followed by a less steep rise in 2022 and 2023," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the US team in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many strains of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genome-study-reveals-this-deadly-fungus-has-been-having-sneaky-sex"&gt;don't respond to regular treatments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;and are resistant&lt;/a&gt; to common cleaners and disinfectants too. The fungus spreads quickly in hospitals, often via equipment like catheters and breathing and feeding tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AkI5NeD4Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it takes hold, a &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infection can cause various serious &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65055878"&gt;and even fatal illnesses&lt;/a&gt; in the bloodstream, the respiratory system, the central nervous system, in organs, and in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus doesn't pose much risk to the general public. Most healthy people are unlikely to pick up an infection as they're less exposed to C. auris, and their bodies are better able to repel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for people who are already ill and in the hospital, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fungal-pathogens-are-mutating-dangerously-as-the-world-gets-hotter"&gt;growing threat&lt;/a&gt; is a very real one. Bloodstream infections continue to be the most common, but infections in soft tissue or bone, and in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, are increasing. The more bases there are to cover, the harder &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; will be to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg" alt="Hospital cleaning" class="wp-image-156397 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean-600x339.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The CDC has issued guidelines for limiting &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; spread. (CDC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern that's emerging in the US is being repeated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-across-the-world-and-we-don-t-know-how-to-stop-it"&gt;across the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and health experts have been struggling to contain &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; since it was first discovered in Japan in 2009. The first US cases were reported in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-fungus-could-be-linked-to-climate-change-study-suggests"&gt;warnings have been issued&lt;/a&gt; about the threat posed by &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; – including a study released &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-deadly-superfungus-can-now-be-found-in-half-of-us-states"&gt;almost exactly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that infections had reached half of the states in the US – but as this Miami study shows, the surge is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;has a lengthy list of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for stopping the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infections, including diligent cleaning routines for surfaces and devices, and the use of single-patient rooms where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measures to prevent the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rely on isolation and contact precautions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that early identification of patients colonized with &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; and the prompt deployment of infection prevention strategies can potentially impact the incidence of bloodstream infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Infection Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hallmark symptoms of ADHD — inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity — typically aren’t as noticeable in adulthood, likely because adults whose ADHD wasn’t diagnosed in childhood have had a lifetime to parse together the skills necessary to compensate for their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some symptoms of ADHD also mimic those of anxiety or depression,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkrissybrady%2Fadult-adhd-signs-symptoms&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacehumanistic.com&amp;amp;xcust=7852141%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cristina Louk;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Cristina Louk&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Washington state, told HuffPost. “Most people will first get diagnosed with these disorders and get frustrated when treatment fails to alleviate their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the moment, you might find yourself attributing certain feelings and behaviors to other things — blaming feelings of hype on too much coffee or snapping at your frozen computer on sleep deprivation — when really, they’re symptoms of adult ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here are some of the sneakier signs you might be overlooking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Procrastinating to the extreme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Henrik Sorensen / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;ADHD brains are always on the lookout for activities that will cause a rush of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that leads to feelings of reward and pleasure and that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkrissybrady%2Fadult-adhd-signs-symptoms&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC2626918%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7852141%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tends to be lower;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;tends to be lower&lt;/a&gt; in people with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because people with ADHD have trouble sustaining enough dopamine during routine tasks that aren’t as interesting to them, they might find themselves doing everything possible to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The average person might feel bored by a routine task, but with ADHD, the negative feeling is more extreme — and so, too, the avoidance of it,” O’Shea said. “It can be missed as a potential ADHD symptom because it looks like intentional laziness and lack of motivation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Hyperfocusing on the same task for hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Microgen / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have ADHD, starting tasks can be a grind — especially tasks you find daunting or believe will be time-consuming — but once you get started, you might find yourself so absorbed by what you’re doing that other important tasks end up neglected as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hyperfocus is a symptom that can easily be missed because it looks like the person is only motivated to do certain activities,” O’Shea said. “It’s sometimes mistaken as selfishness and overzealousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Difficulty switching gears is thought to be caused by low dopamine levels in the brain: The more engrossed you are in a task, the greater the dopamine boost.

As a result, you might use food as a way to unconsciously cope with boredom and emotional distress — or get sucked into a task to the point where you forget to eat for hours, thanks to feeling disconnected from your body’s hunger and fullness cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

			&lt;p&gt;The developmental progress from daredevil teen to risk-averse senior is more complex than we thought, according to a new study that identified changing relationships between neural structures related to risk avoidance at different life stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, led an investigation into a critical part of the brain that help us determine whether we ought 'take the leap' or avoid life-threatening danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ours isn't the only species where adolescents engage in markedly risky behaviors – a pattern that's at odds with protecting ones' survival at all costs. Other animals, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00006-X"&gt;such as mice&lt;/a&gt; for example, share this trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These behaviors may compete with the drive to avo&lt;span&gt;id threatening situations, leading to a reduction in avoidance behaviors in PMA (platform-mediated avoidance assays)," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in their new paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Here, we uncover a circuit mechanism that causally contributes to lower levels of threat avoidance in adolescence."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying the brains of mice, they found the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsomedial_prefrontal_cortex"&gt;dorso-medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (dmPFC) 'referees' neural pathways that take on distinct structures at certain points throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as if the prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain credited for our ability to steer our emotional meat ship on a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/3/794/7424860"&gt;more deliberate course&lt;/a&gt; – is negotiating with the structures that advocate for what we might call 'instinct' (the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basolateral_amygdala"&gt;basolateral amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, or BA, being the locus of fear and pain memory; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;, NA, being crucial to reward, reinforcement and aversion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These negotiations, the experiments showed, depend greatly on age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an experiment reminiscent of James Dean's game of 'chicken run' in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtEp7zFdrc"&gt;Rebel without a cause&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;mice were trained to step on a platform to dodge a threat; a decision made more difficult with a smorgasbord laid out in front of them just out of reach of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing very well how to escape the beep they'd come to associate with an electric shock, juvenile and adolescent mice chose to take their chances and keep on eating for longer, while older mice generally stepped dutifully onto the platform, waiting until the threat had passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A&lt;span&gt;lthough mice of all ages had similar levels of conditioned fear and some exploratory behaviors during the retrieval test, juveniles and adolescents explored the threatening part of the environment more than adults," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fluorescent molecules injected into the test subjects' brains allowed the researchers to track the physiology underpinning these behaviors. Higher levels of glowing molecules generally indicate greater amounts of neural activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Activating genes using light through a process of optogenetics revealed further details on how activity in these brain structures related to threat avoidance strategies in juvenile, adolescent and adult mice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155753" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model.jpg" alt="three similar diagrams showing dmPFC, nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdyla connections at juvenile, adolescent and adult stages." class="size-full wp-image-155753" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model.jpg 1509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-642x197.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-1024x314.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-768x236.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-600x184.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1509px) 100vw, 1509px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155753" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Proposed model of the development of dmPFC circuits underlying threat avoidance. Further detail &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w/figures/8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Klune et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dmPFC, it turns out, becomes more sensitive to threats with age. Much like aging in the rest of the body, however, changes in the structure's configuration occur in staggered stages characterized by maturation of synapses and re-arrangement of the circuits connecting the&lt;span&gt; BA and NA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's risk-avoidance system may be wired to best suit age-specific challenges as they arise, prioritizing risk when the nest is getting too crowded, and safety when it comes time to settle down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mouse study, so it's not clear if these same patterns hold true for humans. But, as mammals, we aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;far-removed from mice&lt;/a&gt;, providing us with a proxy understanding of how our own brains might navigate the tug-of-war between rewarding risk and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The lack of studies on the causal functions of the mPFC, BLA and NAc circuits in the developing brain has left a major gap in our understanding of how interactions between these regions produce developmental transitions in threat-induced behaviors," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;In revealing the processes by which top-down circuit maturation guides changes in threat-induced behaviors, we establish a foundation to understand how they can become disrupted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past neuroscience and psychology studies have shown that after the human brain encodes specific events or information, it can periodically reactivate them to facilitate their retention, via a process known as memory consolidation. The reactivation of memories has been specifically studied in the context of sleep or rest, with findings suggesting that during periods of inactivity, the brain reactivates specific memories, allowing people to remember them in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions in the United States recently conducted a study exploring the possibility that the brain engages in a similar reactivation process during wakefulness to store important information for shorter periods of time. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01884-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the spontaneous reactivation of specific stimuli in the brain during the brief intervals between their encoding predicts the accuracy with which people remember them at the end of a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mike Kahana and I were both quite interested in the long history of thinking about rehearsal and its effects on the way in which people later recalled things," Dr. David Halpern, the first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "Rehearsal is challenging to study since people often do it without any overt behavior (unless we ask them to rehearse out loud)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael J. Kahana's lab at the University of Pennsylvania has been conducting studies related to memory processes for some time. This led to the creation of a dataset that includes memory task performance and matching intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from several people, offering insight into what happens in the brain while people attempt to remember information for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We decided to try to look at when neural activity related to specific words seemed to be reactivated while they were looking at other words and see if that looked like what theorists in psychology thought was going on," said Dr. Halpern. "In addition, there is this parallel literature on consolidation in neuroscience that also suggested that reactivation was key to understanding what gets remembered later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies and theoretical psychology models suggest that memory consolidation processes primarily take place during sleep and over extended periods of rest. During these periods, the brain is not actively engaged in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/everyday+activities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;everyday activities&lt;/a&gt; and external perceptions, but rather focused on internal thoughts or processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, past works suggest that certain neurotransmitters are involved in long timescales, much longer than the time between two-word presentations," said Dr. Halpern. "This meant that looking at neural reinstatement in our data would also have interesting implications for those theories as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers analyzed the data collected by the Kahana Lab, which measured neural activity using intracranial EEG. This is a technique that relies on implanted electrodes, which some patients diagnosed with epilepsy are already exposed to as part of their treatment (i.e., to identify the brain tissue that should be surgically removed to diminish or entirely stop their epileptic seizures).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"These patients need to wait in the hospital until they get enough measurements to determine the source, so a network of our research assistants across the country asked them if they would be willing to do a memory task while their neural activity is being recorded," explained Dr. Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The task we usually use is called free recall: we ask the patients to look at a sequence of words on a screen and then, after a short delay, recall as many of them as they can in any order."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Halpern, Dr. Kahana and their collaborators combined intracranial EEG recordings collected while patients were completing a short-term memory task with their performance on the task (i.e., what they remembered and the order in which they remembered stimuli). The study participants' ability to recall information and the order in which they remember it offers valuable insight into how memories are organized in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Firstly, we found that there seems to be some process happening involving reinstatement of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; on a sub-second scale that is related to later memory performance," said Dr. Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a way in which the brain/mind can, after having an experience, make it more likely to be remembered later and perhaps alter the way in which it is remembered. It is interesting that the processes are, at first glance, quite similar to what we think is going on during sleep."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the initial findings gathered by this team of researchers suggest that the brain also re-activates stimuli that we are trying to remember over short periods of time while we are awake. Further research could help to better understand the brain re-activation processes they observed and determine how they differ from those associated with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+consolidation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt; during sleep or rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, these results could also help devise interventions aimed at improving people's ability to remember information in the short-term, which could be beneficial for both students and people diagnosed with memory disorders. Dr. Halpern has now left the Kahana Lab and now works in another research lab that is exploring the connections between memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am very interested in the way in which rehearsal and reinstatement might be involved in the evaluation process that leads us to make a choice," added Dr. Halpern. "Another question I am quite interested in exploring is, if we are routinely (perhaps subconsciously) rehearsing our past experiences, how does our brain keep these separate from our ongoing veridical perceptual experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In theory, this should cause some interference in terms of remembering the order in which things happened, but this doesn't seem to be the case, even in our data."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hair loss affects millions, yet treatments remain frustratingly complex. Some require a daily commitment, others have side effects—and many simply don’t work for everyone. But scientists may have uncovered a simple hair loss cure that’s been hiding in plain sight: sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just any sugar, though. This new cure is heavily based on one that’s already part of your DNA. Researchers from the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University were studying how a natural sugar called deoxyribose helps heal wounds in mice.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During those experiments, they noticed something odd: fur near the treated areas was growing back faster and thicker than expected. That accidental observation turned into a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full"&gt;focused study&lt;/a&gt; on what would become one of the simplest hair loss cures scientists have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the sugar’s &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/an-actual-cure-for-male-pattern-baldness-may-have-been-discovered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential for treating hereditary-patterned baldness&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers created a gel infused with deoxyribose and applied it to mice with testosterone-induced hair loss. Within weeks, the treated skin began to sprout new fur—dense, long, and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment.

Image source: goodluz/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results weren’t subtle either. In fact, the sugar gel matched the effectiveness of minoxidil, a popular over-the-counter treatment also known as Rogaine. What makes this finding even more compelling is how safe and accessible it could be as a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/the-key-to-a-permanent-cure-for-baldness-may-have-been-discovered/"&gt;hair loss treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deoxyribose is already a naturally occurring sugar in the body, and the gel developed by the research team is biodegradable and non-toxic. In photos comparing different treatments, mice given the sugar gel showed regrowth as strong as those given minoxidil—without needing to combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noticed that the sugar in the simple hair loss cure appeared to increase blood vessel growth and skin cell activity around the hair follicles. Since better blood supply often translates to healthier, thicker hair, this may be one reason the treatment worked so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examined under a microscope, the regrown hairs were visibly thicker than those in the control groups. While it’s not yet clear exactly how deoxyribose triggers this response, the findings are promising—especially given the limited options currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple hair loss cure could potentially help treat alopecia or even aid hair regrowth after chemotherapy. And because it’s built on a naturally occurring molecule, it might offer a gentler alternative for those who can’t tolerate existing medications.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the team is focused on understanding how the sugar works and whether these results can be replicated in humans. But the early signs suggest that an easier, safer approach to treating hair loss could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

But here’s the kicker: the process isn’t as slow and steady as most of us thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive study reveals some eye-opening insights about aging, focusing on exactly “when” things start to shift and how our bodies begin to break down, both inside and out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging isn’t just about wrinkles and gray hairs – there’s a whole internal, built-in timeline, surprisingly similar for all humans, that we’re only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-the-human-body-start-to-age"&gt;When the human body start to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man at the helm of the study is Michael Snyder, chair of genetics at &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. His team’s research provides some fascinating insights into the specifics of our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-delays-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological aging process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his team explored data from individuals ranging from 25 to 75 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research focused on the different molecules playing significant roles in aging, including those constituting our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-your-fingerprint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; – the microcosm of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that exist within us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they discovered that 81% of these molecules don’t follow a predictable, chronological pattern as one might expect. Instead, our bodies experience two periods of rapid change as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp molecular and microbial shifts occur precisely at ages 44 and 60, a finding that may alter our understanding of how our bodies age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome-the-basics"&gt;Understanding the microbiome – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your microbiome is basically the bustling community of trillions of microbes – like bacteria, fungi, and viruses – that live in and on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of them live in your gut, especially in your large intestine, and they’re not just there for lack of anywhere better to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help you digest food, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-meat-less-protein-lacks-certain-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorb nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, and even produce vitamins like B12 and K. Think of them as your behind-the-scenes health squad, working 24/7 to keep things running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiome also plays a huge role in your immune system, mood, and even how your brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the balance of good and bad microbes gets thrown off – like from antibiotics, stress, or a poor diet – it can mess with everything from your energy levels to how well you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why you hear so much buzz about probiotics, fermented foods, and fiber. They’re like fuel for your inner ecosystem, helping your microbiome thrive and keeping you feeling your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-between-aging-and-diseases"&gt;Correlation between aging and diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of death worldwide, showed substantial changes at both of these age intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, molecules connected to our immune function – our body’s vital defense mechanism against disease – changed significantly in individuals entering their early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were driven to investigate these trends after noticing a sharp rise in the risk of developing age-related conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-why-some-brains-resist-alzheimers-disease-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease during mid-life, rather than a steady increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-age-and-the-human-body"&gt;Studying age and the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings are based on data obtained from 108 participants, aiming to unlock the mysteries of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-could-be-the-key-to-better-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biology of aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several years, participants’ biological samples were analyzed every few months, allowing the scientists to track an astonishing 135,000 age-related changes in different molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered thousands of molecules and microbes that undergo shifts, either increasing or decreasing in their abundance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 81 percent of the molecules studied experienced dramatic changes at specific ages. Notably, these transformations were most prevalent when participants were in their mid-40s and early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, who was part of the Stanford Medicine team, pointed out significant changes in the number of molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetics-behind-different-levels-alcohol-consumption-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, and lipid metabolism; cardiovascular disease; and skin and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/molecule-in-coffee-trigonelline-keeps-muscles-young/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; in individuals in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those in their 60s, changes were observed in carbohydrate and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-coffee-good-for-you-it-may-depend-on-your-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, immune regulation, kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and skin and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-lifestyle-a-factor"&gt;Is lifestyle a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could our lifestyles be contributing to these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/losing-loved-ones-can-speed-up-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age-related changes&lt;/a&gt;? Snyder suggests it’s a possibility worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, alcohol metabolism may falter due to the increased alcohol consumption that often occurs in people’s mid-40s, a decade frequently marked by significant life stressors such as career changes, family obligations, or personal challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in behavior can lead to a cascade of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physiological changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists plan to delve deeper into the various triggers for these periods of rapid change, exploring how factors like diet, exercise, and stress management interplay with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these connections could pave the way for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/harvard-scientists-fountain-of-youth-pill-sparks-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthier aging strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-genetics-in-aging"&gt;Role of genetics in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside our environment and lifestyle choices, our genes significantly impact &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exposure-certain-odors-pheromones-speeds-up-aging-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how we age&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone has a unique genetic blueprint that can make them more susceptible to certain health issues as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some gene variations can affect how well our bodies break down substances, handle stress, and even heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these genetic markers, we can gain valuable insights into why some people face age-related health problems sooner than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This knowledge opens the door to personalized medicine, allowing us to create tailored interventions that could boost prevention efforts and enhance our quality of life as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these findings, paying special attention to our health in our 40s and 60s becomes even more critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple measures like increasing physical activity to protect heart health and maintain muscle mass, or reducing alcohol consumption, could go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/monthly-aging-treatment-helps-you-live-long-die-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;delaying the ‘break down’ process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we’re still healthy,” Snyder aptly concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:26:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZEUxdHBzNS1NN3NjZVJPQTBUcXhhYklQVURZbW80UnpTUENGdzhpOFFVQ2hibkdVYVhxVndERzEzcnJJT2pBSWFLWGVMVHMzdHBwLWdYNl9FVkJnbGEwbzJoRmtjOC1GTl96Yk5TRHB6VjdWSWdRa2twMnEyMFM1X3VDeUd4OHFKQmc</guid></item><item><title>Take your fitness to the next level with the 7-Minute Power Workout - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNnA0dGxNZXZGN3V3WDg2WjlTcllHMU9kdWJReGhDTzg3X2dSRHBsbkExMFN1MmlkWXRBYzMyaF8zSGYzZm1BcnMtV1A2OWtNSDVJWVI3Y3U4WExtUXVuY2dELTMzRnEwMTA2MVBVcjU5c2QtSzVfRmh1UlVwaHJNUFZiQnd0Snh1MzdrdG9SS181cG1pZDJZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" data-contentid="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;The more you exercise, the easier it gets. That’s why, at some point, you may need to power up your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" data-contentid="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;It’s important to “find ways to challenge yourself again,” said Chris Jordan, an exercise physiologist and the creator of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;original, science-based 7-minute workout&lt;/a&gt;. Our bodies adapt to the demands of our current workouts, he continued, adding more heart and lung capacity and other changes that make the same workout you’ve been doing for months feel progressively easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" data-contentid="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This process, known as exercise adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-0377-1?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;makes us more athletic and fit&lt;/a&gt;. But, even more important, it can “contribute toward the delayed onset of age-related disease,” according to a comprehensive 2018 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983157/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of how regular exercise benefits our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" data-contentid="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;To help increase your fitness, Jordan developed the 7-Minute Power Workout for The Washington Post. It builds on the scientific principles he used in the original 7-minute workout — featuring 12 movements that increase strength, power and endurance. The exercises focus alternately on the upper and lower body and are meant to be completed at a relatively high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" data-contentid="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;That means your effort should feel like an eight on a scale from zero to 10, Jordan said. Or, more informally, you should be able to speak a few words before pausing for breath, he said, but you shouldn’t be able to sing during the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" data-contentid="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Since the exercises in the new workout are more complex than before, involving a greater range of muscles and coordination, it’s fine to start deliberately and dial in the proper form, Jordan said. Then gradually speed up until you’re pushing yourself during each move for the full seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" data-contentid="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;As always, consider talking with your doctor before trying a new exercise routine. Warm up with a few stretches, jumping jacks or high knees. Then complete as many of each exercise as you can in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" data-contentid="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;So, how can you tell if you’re ready for this power version?

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORT BEND COUNTY, Texas — Fort Bend County Health and Human Services on Sunday announced that it has confirmed its first case of the measles in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county said the case is in a woman between the ages of 50 and 60. They said the case is associated with international travel and is not connected to the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-texas-outbreak-march-25-update/285-a1c5e8c8-37fd-4dbb-975f-4e3af739b9b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your safety and well-being remain my top priority," said Fort Bend County Judge KP George. "I urge all residents to check their immunization records, get vaccinated if necessary and stay vigilant for symptoms. Together, we can protect our families, neighbors and the greater Fort Bend community."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBCHHS is investigating the case and working to identify any potential exposures to limit the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is through vaccination," Fort Bend County Local Health Authority Dr. Gale-Lowe said. "The MMR vaccine is safe, effective and provides strong protection against measles."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBCHHS listed the following measles symptoms to be on the lookout for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (101 degrees or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash, typically starting on the face and spreading downward two to five days after initial symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Koplik spots (bluish-white specks or a red-rose background appearing on the buccal and labial mucosa usually opposite the molars)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health authority said people with the measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears to four days after.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe you've been exposed to the measles or are experiencing measles symptoms, FBCHHS says to isolate yourself to prevent the spread and to contact your healthcare provider via phone before getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

        Samples taken by a Swedish team of researchers show how daily coffee drinkers may be at risk of higher cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease.

A new study by Swedish researchers has found that high levels of cholesterol-elevating substances were present in most coffee machines in workplaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two substances in question are cafestol and kahweol, both found in coffee beans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Uppsala University, in collaboration with the Chalmers University of Technology, took samples from fourteen coffee machines in break rooms at different workplaces using five different coffee brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentrations varied depending on the machine and the time, according to the findings published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nmcd-journal.com/article/S0939-4753(25)00087-0/fulltext"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism &amp;amp; Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewing machines - the most common type of coffee machine in the workplaces studied - and boiled coffee in a pot showed the highest concentration of cholesterol-elevating substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From this, we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee," David Iggman, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, not all coffee machines manage to filter them out. But the problem varies between different types of coffee machines, and the concentrations also showed large variations over time," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL - or low-density lipoprotein - cholesterol is often referred to as the "bad" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Filtered coffee 'is preferable'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it’s clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters was found to almost completely filter out the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine the precise effects on cholesterol levels among consumers, according to Iggman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally present in the body, cholesterol can become a problem if there’s too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can build up in plaque in the walls of arteries making them arteries hard and narrow, according to the US-based Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot that may cause a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe is the region with the highest prevalence of cholesterol in the world, with over 50 per cent of adults estimated to be living with higher than average levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Statista data from 2021, Lithuania had one of the highest average cholesterol levels in Europe, whereas Greece was among the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:13:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQUmlBckJVTnUxNTJLWE1aWUl3b0Jndl9nOG1kZEpDWkwzZi04X0M3MlFfYTdjaVZRdUkwcTRPYU82aG1WdFMwWkJPWFNNSUpFUFc0OVFkSEJsN2hVYVhpdDB1UUJJb2IwNHh2OEVkT3g3RW1JRmFSQm9iWVZsd1ZmVEtTeVZhSFVoOE1fdFNEWF9kdXlfQ1pCVDJOWU5CUDgxR1FlbmNtVUV2UWdkNFUxUlU4MC0xVDBzdkNxUGF0YTRHNU1FZXZHWXV3</guid></item><item><title>World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOZ2dtT1lVU054U0dZUjJLbnJReVdHc2J6cU53VmFWV09MdW5DMVpaN3F0aEkxX3hPSEhYeU5ZUmNLOWNFZjBlNGE4NGx1OUxLam8wQ2xUejIxU3BRMW1nMUdmZXRGRFppYXdpYUlHNFdzZG9xY0pFd2pyNFktZTNfMHRTUEdlTzNxbzVMc2JUcExhWXVJcnpGVXkxc2lYMEUxdk1Kdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most consumed drugs in the US – and the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00316"&gt;most commonly taken analgesic worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;– may do a lot more than simply take the edge off your headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;span&gt;cetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and sold widely under the brand names Tylenol and Panadol, may also increase risk-taking, according to a study from 2020 that measured changes in people's behavior when under the influence of the common over-the-counter medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don't feel as scared,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;neuroscientist Baldwin Way from The Ohio State University when the findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With nearly 25 percent of the population in the US taking acetaminophen each week, reduced risk perceptions and increased risk-taking could have important effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that acetaminophen's effects on pain reduction also extend to various psychological processes, lowering people's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610374741"&gt;receptivity to hurt feelings&lt;/a&gt;, experiencing&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/9/1345/2224135"&gt;reduced empathy&lt;/a&gt;, and even&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tylenol-may-make-it-harder-for-users-to-spot-errors-says-study"&gt;blunting cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147551 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-545x415.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-600x457.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 3D molecule of acetaminophen. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paracetamol-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png"&gt;Ben Mills/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;span&gt;n a similar way, the research suggests people's affective ability to perceive and evaluate risks may potentially be altered or impaired when they take acetaminophen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the effects might be slight – and should be considered hypothetical for now – they're worth noting, given acetaminophen is the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://liverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Common-Medicines-with-Acetaminophen-Know-Your-Dose.pdf"&gt;most common drug ingredient in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found in over 600 different kinds of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments involving over 500 university students as participants, Way and his team measured how a single 1,000 mg dose of acetaminophen (the recommended maximum adult single dosage) randomly assigned to participants affected their risk-taking behavior, compared against placebos randomly given to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the experiments, participants had to pump up an un-inflated balloon on a computer screen, with each single pump earning imaginary money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their instructions were to earn as much imaginary money as possible by pumping the balloon as much as possible, but to make sure not to pop the balloon, in which case they would lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the students who took acetaminophen engaged in significantly more risk-taking during the exercise, relative to the more cautious and conservative  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group. On the whole, those on acetaminophen pumped (and burst) their balloons more than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147552 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-303x415.jpg 303w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-600x821.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Baldwin Way, who led the research. (&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Ohio State News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don't want the balloon to burst and lose your money,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the balloon simulation, participants also filled out surveys during two of the experiments, rating the level of risk they perceived in various hypothetical scenarios, such as betting a day's income on a sporting event, bungee jumping off a tall bridge, or driving a car without a seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the surveys, acetaminophen consumption did appear to reduce perceived risk compared to the control group, although in another similar survey, the same effect wasn't observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While an experiment like this doesn't necessarily reflect how acetaminophen might affect people in real-life scenarios, based on an average of results across the various tests, the team concluded that there is a significant relationship between taking acetaminophen and choosing more risk, even if the observed effect appears slight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers acknowledged the drug's apparent effects on risk-taking behavior could also be interpreted via other kinds of psychological processes, such as reduced anxiety, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It may be that as the balloon increases in size, those on placebo feel increasing amounts of anxiety about a potential burst,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa108/5897711"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the anxiety becomes too much, they end the trial. Acetaminophen may reduce this anxiety, thus leading to greater risk taking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring such psychological alternative explanations for this phenomenon – as well as investigating the biological mechanisms responsible for acetaminophen's effects on people's choices in situations like this – should be addressed in future research, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential impact of acetaminophen's effect on people's risk perception, the drug nonetheless remains one of the most important and highly used medications in the world, considered an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines"&gt;essential medicine by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, even if other questions linger&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We really need more research on the effects of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter drugs on the choices and risks we take," &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Apples also count as one of your five servings of fruits and vegetables, which should be a daily goal, says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they do contain sugar, to minimize blood sugar spikes, control the portion size of apples and pair them with protein and healthy fats, such as nut butter, cheese, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the nutritional value of apples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the breakdown for &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium apple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one medium apple&lt;/a&gt; with skin, which is about three inches in diameter (roughly the size of a baseball or a small fist):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, Johnson and Evelyn Arteche, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I., at Cooper University Health Care, break down some of the reasons to consider eating apples regularly. “It is important to note that you get more nutrition value from eating a whole apple with the skin,” Arteche says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother digestion: &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber in apples can help promote bowel regularity. “Additionally, the pectin in apple skin serves as a prebiotic, supporting a healthy microbiome and overall gut health,” says Johnson. “Research indicates that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in various aspects of health, including mental well-being, disease risk, and immune function.” Studies explicitly examining the effects of apples on gut health are limited, but extensive research supports the beneficial impacts of fiber and pectin on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;“Apples can aid in weight management, particularly when consumed in place of higher-calorie, less healthy options,” says Johnson. Research specifically evaluating the effects of apple consumption on weight management in humans is limited. But, Johnson points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one 2015 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; which found that higher fruit and vegetable intake, as well as increased intake of apples and pears, was inversely associated with weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-fiber foods with high water content, such as apples, promote satiety so you feel fuller longer than if you, say, ate a cookie. “Fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness lasting longer when compared to drinking juice, for example, which does not contain much fiber,” says Arteche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have yielded mixed results specifically regarding apple consumption and heart health. “Despite these mixed findings, substantial research links diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as seen in those following the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;,” says Johnson. “Increasing fruit and vegetable intake, including apples, may contribute to cardiovascular health by supporting gut microbiome balance, promoting weight management, and providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals implicated in cardiovascular disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential side effects of eating apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diarrhea:&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber in excess can cause diarrhea in some people,” says Arteche. “For example, people with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, a new colostomy, or a new ileostomy may need to avoid apples, especially apples with skin on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; “People who are allergic to apricot, plum, almond, peach, pear, and strawberry can also be allergic to apples and should avoid them,” says Arteche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar elevation:&lt;/strong&gt; “Although apples are a healthy, low-calorie food, they are naturally high in sugar, which may contribute to blood sugar elevations, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,” says Johnson. “However, in comparison to other fruits, apples have a lower glycemic index, meaning that they do not spike blood sugar to the same extent as some other carbohydrate foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples generally are safe to eat daily unless you have a food allergy, or other medical reason to avoid them. (Always talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure whether a food is for you or not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their fiber and water content, apples promote digestive regularity and also may help you feel fuller longer, so they can play a role in weight management. They also contribute to your daily goal for both fiber and servings of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BTjRheEgwZ0JYaGZRLTRQZ2R1aE96VXlndl9VeVBXejdMXzVXaEhkYzhBbjFhenVXRlRJZjk5dDhGYnlsNWxmb1lOMDYzYnVGMDNTVmhhYjJwUGdlZm1GWFR5SnpaQW9lb3c</guid></item><item><title>Tech for babies is booming.

provide sustained energy, according to studies," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a larger meal at night can be more difficult to digest, increase the likelihood of acid reflux and disrupted sleep due to slower metabolism during the evening, Routhenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a large meal before bedtime can cause acid reflux and disrupt sleep, a dietitian told Fox News Digital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The

registered dietitian, founder of the NY Nutrition Group and author of "The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan," isn't entirely on "team big breakfast" or bust, but she does see the merits of consuming a

have an appetite and the time for a larger breakfast, you may notice fewer cravings and urges to eat at night, more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz stressed, however, that there is no one-size-fits-all methodology for meal planning and portion distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to plan out meals is to sit down and figure out your specific needs, lifestyle and what's realistic," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you want to ingest some kind of nourishment every three to four hours throughout the day — starting with the first hour you wake up and aiming to give yourself at least two to three hours of digestive rest before bedtime, Moskovitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a big breakfast could lead to more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, according to a dietitian.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, people report feeling more energy, fewer cravings and reasonable calorie intake when they make time for a balanced, protein- and fiber-rich breakfast," she said, further making the case for a filling breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz shared a day-in-the-life example of front-loading your diet by eating a larger breakfast, followed by smaller meals for lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose from any of the following options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 eggs + 2 slices of sprouted grain bread + ½ avocado + 1 cup of fresh fruit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1

inspiration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One breakfast option that's rarely discussed, said Moskovitz, is eating &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/dinner" rel="nofollow

and sufficient energy throughout the day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein's sample meal plan, adhering to this bigger breakfast principle, makes use of a robust, savory breakfast, followed

class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that adults who report high levels of autistic traits through online surveys may not reflect the same social behaviors or clinical profiles as those who have been formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although these two groups may appear similar on paper, the study found meaningful differences in their social interactions, mental health symptoms, and the way they perceive and influence others during social tasks. The findings raise questions about the widespread reliance on self-report surveys in online autism research and suggest that diagnostic evaluations by trained professionals remain essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by a team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were motivated by a growing trend in psychiatric research: the shift toward large-scale, web-based studies. Online platforms like Prolific allow researchers to gather data from thousands of people quickly and inexpensively. While this approach has clear advantages in terms of scale and accessibility, it often relies solely on participants’ own descriptions of their traits and mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By allowing people to participate in research remotely and anonymously, online studies ease many of the burdens associated with in-person involvement and allow researchers to recruit large samples quickly. However, as online studies become increasingly popular in psychiatric research, it is essential to evaluate their limitations,” said study authors Sarah M. Banker, who is now a postdoctoral fellow NYU Langone, and Xiaosi Gu, an associate professor and director of the Center for Computational Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably, anonymous online research typically relies on self-report to measure symptoms and identify participants with specific psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Without the added context of clinical evaluation, self-reported symptoms may be limited in their ability to capture the experiences and diagnoses of people who have difficulties describing their emotions and struggles – including many autistic individuals. Our study sought to evaluate whether autistic participants identified through online self-reported symptoms show similar profiles to those identified through in-person clinical evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared three groups of adults. One group included 56 individuals who were diagnosed with autism after undergoing in-person clinical evaluations. The second group consisted of 56 people recruited online who reported high levels of autistic traits using a standard survey. A third group, also recruited online, reported low levels of autistic traits and served as a comparison. All participants were matched in age and gender to allow for fair comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a mix of questionnaires and interactive tasks. All participants completed the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire, which measures characteristics often associated with autism, including social difficulties and rigid behavior. The in-person group also underwent clinical interviews and standardized assessments conducted by trained professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all three groups participated in two computer-based tasks designed to simulate social interactions. One task measured the participant’s ability to influence the behavior of virtual characters to gain rewards, while the other tracked their social decision-making over time, such as whether they acted warmly or distantly toward new characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that although the high-trait online group and the in-person autism group reported similar levels of autistic traits, their profiles differed in key ways. The online group with high autistic traits reported more symptoms of social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder than the clinically diagnosed group. In fact, their psychiatric profiles resembled those of people who are socially anxious but not necessarily autistic. This suggests that some people who score high on autism trait questionnaires in the general population may actually be describing a different type of social struggle—one rooted more in anxiety than in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings came from the comparison between self-report and clinical assessment. Among participants with a confirmed autism diagnosis, there was no meaningful relationship between how they rated their own symptoms and how clinicians rated them. This held true for both core domains of autism: repetitive behaviors and social communication. The two types of measures seemed to capture different aspects of the condition—one reflecting internal experience and the other focusing on observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that, for adults with a confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (and without co-occurring intellectual disability), higher clinician-rated symptoms did not correspond to higher self-reported symptoms,” Banker and Gu told PsyPost. “This finding suggests that the two measures capture different aspects of autism: while self-reported assessments may capture internal experiences, clinician-rated assessments may capture external presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences also emerged in how participants behaved during the social interaction tasks. In the first task, which tested whether participants could influence virtual characters by accepting or rejecting monetary offers, the in-person autism group showed reduced ability to recognize and use social influence. They rejected fewer high offers and did not adjust their behavior in ways that would have led to better future outcomes. They also reported less awareness of their ability to influence the game, suggesting a diminished perception of social controllability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, both the high-trait and low-trait online groups performed similarly on this task and showed more awareness of their influence. This points to a key distinction: while individuals in both online groups may share internal feelings of social difficulty, their external behavior in social contexts does not mirror the social differences seen in people with a clinical autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second task, which involved choosing how to interact with different characters during a simulated narrative, the in-person autism group again showed unique patterns. They were less likely to choose friendly or affiliative responses, even when their self-reported feelings toward the characters were similar to those of the online high-trait group. This gap between internal attitude and external behavior was specific to the clinically diagnosed group, suggesting that their social behavior was more affected by their condition than by their feelings or intentions alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite similarly high levels of self-reported autistic traits, adults recruited online (without self-identification of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis) and those recruited in-person (with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis confirmed through clinical evaluation) displayed different psychiatric profiles and tendencies during simulated social interactions, suggesting they may represent different groups,” Banker and Gu explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that, without additional information (such as diagnostic information collected by trained professionals), self-reported symptom surveys may not be sufficient to identify or draw representative conclusions about certain diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder. This work emphasizes the important distinction between diagnoses and traits and provides a caution against the potential for generating assumptions about one group based on the findings from research conducted in another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters not just for research, but also for clinical care. If online studies are used to shape understanding of autism or to develop interventions, it is important that the participants truly reflect the population the research aims to help. Otherwise, there is a risk of creating treatments or policies that are not effective—or even relevant—for those who are clinically diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is also interesting when considering the emerging use of online mental health platforms, where clinician evaluation is not always available and symptom severity (and improvement) only relies solely on self-report,” the researchers noted. “Our finding suggests that such approach might need to be revisited and compared against human clinician evaluations/ratings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers were also careful to note that self-reports still have an important role to play. They are valuable tools for understanding how individuals experience their own challenges. In fact, self-reports can offer insights that clinicians might miss, particularly when it comes to internal states like anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although our findings highlight discrepancies between self-reported and clinician-rated symptoms, they do not diminish the value of self-report surveys in autism research,” Banker and Gu said. “In fact, self-reports are crucial for understanding individuals’ own experiences, internal distress, and overall wellbeing. They also empower individuals with lived experience to shape narratives about their condition and help to challenge inaccurate assumptions about the reasons behind autistic behaviors. Rather than discounting personal perspectives, our results emphasize caution for researchers in relying solely on self-reported symptom measures when defining or generalizing about diagnostic groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phenotypic divergence between individuals with self-reported autistic traits and clinically ascertained autism&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah M.

The collection had accrued over the course of several years, picked up – and then swiftly dropped. Health sprees that &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/century-of-fad-diets-history-weight-loss-trends-b2689369.html"&gt;only had a hefty bill&lt;/a&gt; from Holland &amp;amp; Barrett to show for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of us are susceptible to the idea that&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/collagen-food-diet-supplements-b2717960.html"&gt; “investing” in our health&lt;/a&gt; equates to spending hard-earned cash to prove to ourselves that we’re serious. The unworn trainers or expensive yoga pants, the unused gym membership (a cliché because it’s true) – and, for others like me, a huge box of very good intentions, rattling around the drawer under the bathroom sink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I clear out everything best before 2022 (or, in some cases, 2019)? Yes. Did I also reignite the urge to buy more? Naturally. Like most people, I’d also been recently caught in the TikTok wellness trap, where everyone appears to have the answers, no matter what their credentials. Powdered greens – a dietary supplement of vegetables, fruits and algae which claims to be a concentrated dose of nutrients – appeared to be a brilliantly easy panacea, as did &lt;a href="/topic/supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; I’d never previously taken notice of – milk thistle, to cleanse a tired liver for a tenner, or ashwagandha to lower blood pressure and anxiety, and collagen for pretty much everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need pointing out that the platform has very little merit in the health world, yet sales of beauty and wellness products such as supplements are through the roof on ever-influential TikTok Shop – and this is big business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supplements industry, health really is wealth. Over the last 15 years, the over-the-counter &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals market has grown exponentially, generating more than £650m in UK sales last year. In the US, it’s far higher, with one of the more conservative estimates suggesting Americans will be swallowing $70bn of supplements by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, unsurprising. Five years ago, we lived through an unprecedented global health crisis that, when life was boiled down to the bare basics, gave us all a thorough wake-up call. Covid led us all to reconsider our perceptions of health, the way we live and, crucially, how we prevent ourselves from getting ill. Naturally, many people turned to quick-fix supplements – and sales were their highest in more than a decade; almost twice the amount sold nationally last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is what the supplement sector thrives on – but as to whether they work, it’s a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One size does not fit all &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should think about taking supplements like a prescription,” says registered nutritional therapist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gqjordannutrition"&gt;GQ Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the time, we’re conditioned to think that taking supplements, whatever they are, must be safeguarding or improving our health. We forget that health – existing or genetically predisposed conditions, our levels of fitness and diet – is not an equal starting point for all of us. Additionally, some over-the-counter vitamins and minerals can interact with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another; everyone has their own signs and symptoms of what they might be lacking, probably the first thing to do is to track those to see if there’s any consistency. So, if you’re waking up in the night consistently or having an energy dip in the afternoon, it might be a good sign to consider taking some magnesium or vitamin D to see if they help,” advises Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 iTcyPS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177518"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, Jordan says, speak to your GP about your own health status before deciding what you need supplementing, and before sinking a load of cash into your local pharmacy. Or, if that’s not possible and you can afford to, put that money towards seeing a nutritionist. Getting goodness through diet is more sustainable in the long run because of how things are broken down in our gut. Some supplements aren’t suitable for people with underlying health concerns, especially when it comes to the liver, which must process everything you put in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that your requirements will change depending on your current situation. As we age, our hormones change drastically, which can change what we need and how much of it is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all supplements are made equal &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from it. Supplements, says Lynsey Vaughan, nutritionist and product innovation lead at wellness brand &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.highernature.com%252Fpages%252Four-story%253F_gl%253D1%252A6w73fg%252A_up%252AMQ..%252A_gs%252AMQ..%2526gclid%253DCj0KCQjwkZm_BhDrARIsAAEbX1EmG8buaB6PRaZzLVF2Wm9Rieu9dTWLYwJ4J9Ys3BCibB2hnVF79IoaApkFEALw_wcB%2526gbraid%253D0AAAAAD_kRq7f59ux-F7N4wZkZOUZIbnBQ%26sref%3D%2Fhealth-and-wellbeing%2Fsupplements-gut-health-wellness-b2723535.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fhealth-and-wellbeing%2Fsupplements-gut-health-wellness-b2723535.html&amp;amp;article_id=2723535&amp;amp;author=Zo%C3%AB+Beaty&amp;amp;tag=supplements%2Cgut+health%2CVitamins%2Cwellbeing&amp;amp;section=N%2FA&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-03-30T12%3A05%3A34.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=feature-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;Higher Nature, &lt;/a&gt;which is “committed to unmasking the world of supplements”. “There are a few things to keep in mind,” Vaughan explains, particularly whether the capsule or tablet is made of natural ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A non-active ingredient might be the physical shell that you put the ingredients into, and then there are also excipients, which is an industry term for non-active ingredients. Not all supplements have them in – and many don’t have the right amount in. For a good supplement, you want the actual ingredient, limited non-active and synthetic ingredients, and to get the right dose. There are many that I come across where I’ll look at the formula and think, ‘What is that even doing?’ Often there’s no real benefit at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 jDSKHB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="You can’t out-supplement a bad diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177519"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;You can’t out-supplement a bad diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in ultra-processed foods, look at how many ingredients are listed. Too many non-active or synthetic ingredients make it much harder for the body to digest and, adds Jordan, can cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “You could think that you’re safeguarding your health or being proactive, which comes from a really good place, but then choose supplements that might not be right for you on a personal level or up to scratch. That could have a real impact on other aspects of your health, particularly your &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, because the supplements contain all these buffers and preservatives that aren’t really essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut lining is super-sensitive. It’s the barrier between our outside world and our body, essentially, and these things can have a compounding irritating effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the label, look out for “synthetics versus natural food form”, recommends Vaughan. “Most people assume that vitamins and minerals are natural. In fact, one survey found that 70 per cent of people think that vitamins and minerals in fortified foods are natural, but they’re not – they’re synthetic. Similarly in the supplement world, there’s a huge knowledge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can’t ‘out supplement’ a bad diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m allergic to the wellness industry wheel,” Jordan jokes. “Most of the ads we all see online – things like green powders, for example – should be under investigation, in my opinion. Many of them create pain points for people and then target them for vulnerability: weight loss, infertility … Solve your PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] with an expensive green powder. It’s really dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177520"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can mean that we end up feeling more comfortable paying less attention to what we’re actually eating. “Nothing can supplement a bad lifestyle,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan agrees. “Based on dietary data, around 75 per cent of people in the UK are not eating enough oily fish,” she says. Generally, our diets have changed exponentially in the last few decades – and Vaughan knows the impact from her own health struggles with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. “I forced myself to eat liver, which is full of nutrients, when I went through my own health struggles,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, especially in poorer communities, we used to eat much more offal and cheap oily fish such as kippers. It goes without saying that we should also be focusing on eating lots of rich, leafy greens and moving our bodies enough, which all helps with our gut health and would alleviate the need for so many supplements in the first place. That baseline, both Vaughan and Jordan agree, must be heeded before we start trying to compensate over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you take just one supplement, this should be it &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a close call here: for Jordan, vitamin D, omega 3 and magnesium all chart high; for Vaughan, omega 3 just about tips it with vitamin D a close second. In fact, the government recommends we should all take a supplement for vitamin D, as thanks to the lack of sunlight in the UK, which stimulates the production of it in our bodies naturally, most of us are deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in winter and autumn months,” says Jordan. “Just having that can really help your energy, help your mood, help your gut as well, and your immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hItpXp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177521"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even when we are eating enough oily fish, which is packed with omega 3, Vaughan notes that recent years have seen fluctuations in the amount of nutrients we’re getting from fish like salmon and mackerel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s some evidence that omega 3 levels in oily fish have been declining over the last 50 years,” she explains. So there’s a combination of, not only are we not eating enough, but the amount that you used to have to eat to get enough omega 3 is now no longer enough either, so it exacerbates it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega 3s are so important for us at the cellular level – every single cell membrane needs omega 3s to kind of work their membranes to work flexibly, to let nutrients in, let waste out. They’re also good for hormone balance, brain function. It’s incredibly necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan agrees, adding that it’s especially important in pregnancy and postpartum. “A particular DHA, a specific type of omega 3, is given to the baby, not mum in that time. So women who have experienced brain fog after giving birth, for example, might benefit from supplementing with omega 3 to get those levels back up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTGhJd2h1Vjl0bDhubWRhMjl5QmUtdmc2bzBYdm1mOFA0OEpOdVAwMjlENVF0WTRNN0MzcG0tb0t3TkJiUFpDMFFtaEZrM0FqcDV1aDRfY0JMakxsUWplSjFaNGRtZVBWZUhFU2NON1hMY25KOUZsN3otVWwwX280WDFDbjJ5MVZRYnBJS25xWVp2MVBDa0VNZk50MnA</guid></item><item><title>In research-rich San Diego, Trump cuts hit studies of HIV, domestic violence and more - The San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNSy1PWW5NbllUWlFnclhUOTd0MC1vTklXRlhsSkpYQ1dqcUt2djBDdDRRcGtJTVBrVEQ4ZE5jZmlaNTh6VFJxT29oZHVjb25JUnAxUWs0OVc5YUxBU0RPdjlPaUx2OHdpV0NRN1d5ejlwNmRMYjlGMXVpaGozX3pEcDdOX1JVaVFNdDdzOUpOM2lLNUFQLTd0TzdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is pulling funding to San Diego researchers exploring issues from HIV prevention to violence against pregnant women, and local scientists warn the impacts will extend far beyond simply ending current projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the cuts will cost students future jobs and training opportunities, stunting the country’s pipeline of future scientists, and that the administration’s targeting of diversity programs and research will make the scientific workforce less diverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists say they even feel pressured to censor or distort known scientific facts in their grant applications, for fear of being denied funding because the applications relate to topics the Trump administration has sought to defund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has said the federal government “spends too much money on programs, contracts, and grants that do not promote the interests of the American people,” as he wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/radical-transparency-about-wasteful-spending/"&gt;Feb. 18 memo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health, where many of the research cuts are concentrated, did not answer questions about what kinds of grants the NIH is cutting and why or about scientists’ concerns about the impacts of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But funding termination letters from the agency indicate it is cutting projects it believes deal with topics such as diversity, equity and gender that agency leaders consider unscientific and unrelated to Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Diego Union-Tribune interviewed several local researchers who recently learned their grant funding was cut, or who are anticipating cuts based on the topics they research or the programs from which they derive funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major cut hit UC San Diego on Thursday when the Trump administration ordered Dr. Davey Smith, director of infectious diseases, to pause or limit work on 16 clinical trials focused on HIV/AIDS, including long-term efforts to develop a vaccine against HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said that work collectively represents about $2.5 million in annual NIH funding, and the disruption includes one genomic program that’s involved hundreds of participants dating back more than 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, at least three other NIH-funded projects at local universities have been terminated, &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf"&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include a study at UC San Diego investigating effects of testosterone replacement therapy for transgender men, one at San Diego State investigating mental health impacts from sexual minority stigma and another study at UCSD into how intersectional stigma toward Latino men who have sex with men affects their use of HIV testing and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘A difficult day’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 21 brought bad news and worse news for Keith Horvath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH axed funding for a three-year study about HIV prevention that the San Diego State psychology professor was co-leading with UC San Diego professor of medicine Susan Little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to investigate how to get more people at risk of contracting HIV to take pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a highly effective HIV preventive drug regimen. They developed a mobile app that provides patients with information about PrEP, and their study is investigating whether trial participants who used it were more likely to take and follow through with PrEP than participants who didn’t have the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with just three months left in the study, now Horvath and Little have lost their funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren’t enough, Horvath also learned that same Friday that a decades-old national research network he is involved in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/25/nih-cuts-include-hiv-aids-prevention-program-for-adolescents/"&gt;also was axed&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV Interventions, which began in 2001, is the only research network in the U.S. that focuses on HIV among young people ages 13 to 24, Horvath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sadly, that really ended 24 years of scientific progress for young people in terms of HIV,” he said. “As you can imagine, Friday was a difficult day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These losses are just two of several federal grants focused on HIV research and prevention that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/cdc-hiv-prevention-treatment.html"&gt;has recently targeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of Horvath and Little’s funding will not only hurt the researchers conducting the study, they say, but also the 116 patients participating in their clinical trial. Some patients are still in the middle of completing their PrEP regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are individuals who are seeking the best health care and the best opportunities they can get, and they viewed this study as one way of fulfilling that,” Little said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not all of the participants finish the trial, it will compromise the study’s nearly three years of work and what can be learned from it, Horvath said. Horvath and Little are looking for alternative private funding and considering writing an appeal letter to the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their award was terminated because the NIH decided that their project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” the NIH told them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” an NIH official wrote in the termination letter. “Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horvath and Little’s study is not about gender identity. Horvath speculates that their funding was flagged for termination because men who have sex with men, as well as transgender women, are highly impacted and at risk for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we were following the science of who is at highest risk of HIV, it seems to be that’s why it was defunded,” Horvath said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added, “Our decision to enroll members of those communities isn’t based on a political agenda at all. It’s based off of sound scientific evidence of which Americans are at highest need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It’s not the first time’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian Cazares is becoming a neuroscientist so he can help people like him become scientists, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated from Mexico as a youth and is a product of U.S. public education, Cazares is now a neuroscience postdoctoral researcher at UCSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to be a research professor to not only do cool science, but to help diversify the workforce by providing mentorship that is a lot more relatable to people of low-income means or Latinos,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work focuses on studying brain activity in children with autism spectrum disorder and investigating whether anything gets missed when scientists use animals, such as mice, to model such brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260903" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-research-grants-001.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Christian Cazares poses for a photo at UC San Diego on Wednesday, March 26, 2025 in San Diego.

(Meg McLaughlin / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares’ postdoctoral career is funded by a NIH fellowship called &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250201161136/https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/training/nih-blueprint-and-brain-initiative-d-span-award-f99k00"&gt;D-SPAN&lt;/a&gt;, which has provided up to six years of funding for promising neuroscience graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds nationwide. The fellowship has helped develop more than 200 neuroscientists since 2017, according to the NIH, many of them women and people of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has targeted federal programs like D-SPAN that are &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/"&gt;focused on diversity&lt;/a&gt; and equity because he says such programs discriminate based on race and sex and contradict American values of individual merit and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares is in the second year of what is supposed to be a four-year grant through D-SPAN. He said this month he has not yet been told officially whether D-SPAN is canceled or whether his fellowship funding — his salary — will be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early February, the NIH has changed references to the D-SPAN program on its website from the present tense to the past tense, scrubbed the word “diversity” from the program webpage and the program is no longer accepting applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares worries that the end of funding for diversity and equity programs will mean fewer low-income people of color will become scientists, and will ultimately set back research efforts to solve problems facing those communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, Cazares has no plans to leave science. He is looking for alternative funding as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s basically a matter of adapting and recognizing it’s not the first time in history that people like us have been excluded from science,” Cazares said. “We just have to do what we can in the meantime and hold the line until we can make a better future for the next generation of scientists, once things hopefully change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘We have to just keep trying’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Brenda Bloodgood talks to students almost daily who say they don’t know why they’re trying to become a scientist right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often don’t know what to tell them, except we have to just keep trying and hope that this turns around,” the UCSD associate professor of neurobiology said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of UCSD’s neuroscience graduate student program, Bloodgood said she is now seeing labs losing their funding, which means they are no longer able to pay for the undergraduate or graduate students they employ. As a result, first-year students are struggling to find a lab that is able to take them — a requirement for their training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260904" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-UCSD-Science-Rally07-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="SAN DIEGO, CA - MARCH 7, 2025: Brenda Bloodgood, an associate professor of neurobiology, speaks to the crowd during the Stand Up for Science Rally, one of several rallies nation wide protesting federal cuts to science, at the UC San Diego campus in San Diego on Friday, March 7, 2025.

(Hayne Palmour IV / For The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, the neuroscience graduate program has decided to shrink its incoming cohort size from 18 students to no more than 12, Bloodgood said. Similar reductions are happening at graduate programs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodgood is also the co-director of UCSD’s &lt;a href="https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/start-neuro/index.html"&gt;STARTneuro&lt;/a&gt;, a NIH-funded program that provided training, mentorship and funding for 10 community college transfer students each year to help them enter neuroscience research. The program’s NIH funding expired this year – and Bloodgood’s team has applied for a renewal — but the program’s future is unclear as federal officials have targeted programs that similarly support underrepresented students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had been entirely designed to provide training and mentorship opportunities to students that had not had those opportunities,” Bloodgood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of the ongoing cuts go beyond the immediate impact of ending current research, Bloodgood stressed — it also means that universities will train and produce fewer future scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a brain drain problem that will have ripple effects years into the future, Bloodgood said, noting that it takes a decade to train a neuroscientist. Meanwhile, other countries see an opportunity to gain and cultivate research talent; many European officials have said they plan &lt;a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/europe-offers-refuge-to-americas-researchers/4021201.article"&gt;to recruit&lt;/a&gt; fleeing American scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have a significant contraction of the scientific workforce,” Bloodgood said. “This will be felt in academia for obvious reasons, but this will also be felt in biotech, in pharmaceutical companies — the biomedical industry writ large.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘If I can’t try out things, I can’t tell you how to fix it’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant women and recently pregnant women in the U.S., but relatively little research has been conducted on why that is or how to prevent it, said Rebecca Fielding-Miller, associate professor of public health at UCSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller was part of a team of researchers on a grant project that would have focused on the role of intimate partner violence in mortality for these women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was going to train a dozen early-career scientists and clinicians to conduct their own research on the issue. Each of them would have received a yearlong mentorship and produced a research paper. And the researchers were going to write an open-source curriculum on how to train others to conduct similar research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH axed the project’s $400,000, two-year grant on March 21. The team had not yet recruited any participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260905" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-ICON-UCSD-Jacobs-Medical-Center-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Inside a maternity room the Rady Women and Infants Pavilion at UCSD Jacobs Medical Center in La Jolla on Monday, July 31, 2023 in San Diego, California.

(Alejandro Tamayo / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH stated its reasons in its termination letter for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller found the letter insulting — particularly its suggestion that fostering research into deadly violence against pregnant and recently pregnant women would “not enhance health, lengthen life or reduce illness.” She noted that pregnancy is associated with a significantly higher risk of homicide for Black women and younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller said the administration’s decisions to target research based on its mention of terms and issues it opposes — such as women, gender and ethnicity — means public health realities that affect or disproportionately affect various communities will go unexplored and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t measure a problem, we can’t tell you it exists. If I can’t use the words to describe the problem, I can’t tell you it exists. If I can’t try out things, I can’t tell you how to fix it,” Fielding-Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staff writer Gary Robbins contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever asked yourself why it is, that when the dessert menu arrives, somehow, you always seem to have space? Well, researchers might have the answer. The team at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.mpg.de/24159607/0211-neur-dessert-stomach-emerges-in-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the same nerve cells that make us feel full after a meal are also responsible for our sweet cravings afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fabien Naneix, a neuroscientist from the Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen and an expert on how &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-hidden-sugar-in-everyday-foods/"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; affects the brain, explains that in this study they found “a subset of neurons located in a very deep part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which usually signal for us to stop eating after a meal. These were actually driving sugar consumption in mice, even when they were full.” Using brain imaging, they found similar results in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has interesting implications for how we approach the very real issue of sugar overconsumption, which is one of the main drivers of poor health conditions such as obesity, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we choose to eat is controlled by our brain. But not all foods are equally ‘rewarding’ for the brain,” says Dr Naneix. “Knowing that craving sugary foods and hunger levels are not necessarily correlated – and that these same brain circuits are involved in other processes like emotion, mood and motivation – can help us manage our cravings better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five ways to work with your body if you want to dial down that sweet tooth – or satisfy it in a healthier way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Fill up on fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Clark, a dietitian, advises &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/old-fashioned-foods-full-of-cancer-fighting-fibre/"&gt;upping fibre&lt;/a&gt; in the diet to prevent blood sugar spikes, which drive sugar cravings. Recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5390821/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found that eating prebiotic fibre, found in foods like onions, garlic, asparagus and apples, causes changes in the gut bacteria that directly affect the brain, making you less likely to crave sugary foods. Switch to wholegrain bread, rice and pasta and leave the skins on potatoes for an immediate fibre boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. Ensure there’s a good helping of healthy fats and protein in your meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They make you feel more satisfied and less likely to reach for something sweet after a meal. Healthy fats, in the form of full-fat dairy, nuts, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-of-avocados/"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; and olive oil, and protein in nuts, eggs, fish and beans, are important in determining how satisfied you feel, so try to include them in every meal. For example, at breakfast, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-toast/"&gt;toast with jam&lt;/a&gt; provides little protein and healthy fat and won’t fill you up; choose toast with avocado and scrambled egg instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;3. Go for whole foods to reduce sugary cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is the addictive nature of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/rob-hobson-family-cooking/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs) that food manufacturers have a term for the precise combination of sugar, salt, and fat levels that maximise the consumer’s desire to keep eating by triggering the brain’s pleasure centres; it’s known as “the bliss point”. Reducing UPFs is, therefore, key to reducing cravings. Focus on simple meals with whole ingredients. If you do buy packaged foods, check the list of ingredients and try to avoid those with additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;4. Pay attention to what you’re eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark is keen to point out that often the desire for sweet food comes from the need to be soothed, particularly when we are stressed, and giving in to this craving can be accompanied by feelings of shame. Try eating mindfully: we often eat a sugary snack because we are not tuned into our body’s hunger signals. So before reaching for that biscuit, ask yourself these questions: How hungry am I on a scale of one to 10? If it’s less than eight, you’re not really hungry. Am I just bored or in need of a break? Perhaps have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/why-british-right-about-drinking-tea-green-or-black/"&gt;a cup of tea&lt;/a&gt; instead. Can I ride this out until the next meal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. If you’re going to have dessert, enjoy it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to eat dessert, Clark advises choosing smaller portions but ramping up the comfort in which you eat them, i.e. don’t stand guiltily by the fridge. Use a plate, sit down and enjoy your snack. You can make more nutritious sweet treats too. Have a square of dark chocolate with a teaspoon of nut butter to satisfy your sweet tooth in a more sustaining way.&lt;br&gt;To put it simply, a holistic approach is the best way to deal with sugar cravings, as Dr Naniex confirms: “There is no magic solution, but maintaining a healthy diet to include better quality foods, plenty of physical activity, and a more balanced, less stressful life is the best way to reduce our reliance on sugary foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Three easy (and healthy) chocolate treats to curb your sweet tooth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Dark fruit and nut chocolate ‘pizza’&lt;/h2&gt;

These include hormonal or metabolic changes, age, medications and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor said she herself experienced hair loss some years back &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:due to a medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;due to a medication&lt;/a&gt; she was taking for an autoimmune disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/5-excellent-protein-sources-arent-meat-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Excellent Protein Sources That Aren't Meat, According To Nutritionists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Excellent Protein Sources That Aren't Meat, According To Nutritionists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a hard time putting my hair up in a ponytail.

This phantom noise often takes a toll on sleep, focus, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mental-health-in-the-workplace-navigating-challenges-and-promoting-well-being/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, increasing feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause lies in disrupted nerve activity, usually after damage to the ear or head. But other factors—like background noise, attention levels, memory, and mood—can shape how severe it feels. Despite years of study, no cure has emerged, though the search continues with growing urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the challenge stems from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-study-reveals-hidden-hearing-modes-within-the-human-ear/"&gt;tinnitus’s strange nature&lt;/a&gt;. People hear what isn’t there—buzzing, ringing, or hissing. Because it doesn’t stem from a single injury or illness, treatments have mostly tried to ease symptoms, not eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional therapies focus on reshaping how the brain responds to the phantom sound. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) helps people cope with distress, while sound therapies try to mask or soften the perception. Results have been mixed, and relief varies from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield says this is a treatment made possible by recent technology developments.

Here, tools like Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) or acoustic stimulation attempt to retrain the brain. They work to reduce the sound's emotional impact or help the brain filter it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="transforming_treatment_with_digital_therapeutics"&gt;Transforming Treatment with Digital Therapeutics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study at the &lt;a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; compared TRT with a partial version of the therapy and standard care. Researchers tracked 151 patients for 18 months. In the full TRT group, 47.1% showed clear improvement in quality of life, versus 40.5% who received standard care. While promising, these gains were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other trials have looked to technology for answers. The ACR T30 Neurostimulator used targeted sound bursts to disrupt brain patterns. Yet the results showed little difference from placebo. A separate study that paired sound therapy with tongue stimulation also produced only slight improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield, who led the study, explained, "This therapy de-emphasizes tinnitus, relegating it to background noise with no meaning or relevance." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12-week trial, 65% of participants reported improvement, with some experiencing life-changing results. Audiology research fellow Dr. Phil Sanders noted, "For some, it shifted from overwhelming their lives to being manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.958730/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, randomized 61 patients, comparing the polytherapeutic app to a widely-used white noise app. Significant improvements were observed in the polytherapeutic group, including reduced tinnitus severity and enhanced mental well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings mark a critical milestone in tinnitus treatment, emphasizing the potential of comprehensive, accessible digital interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Example screenshots for (A) the USL intervention (i) Menu, (ii) Passive therapy sounds, (iii) AOIL task, (iv) Tracking task.

Factors such as environmental conditions, psychological predispositions, and individual neural patterns influence its manifestation. This variability highlights the limitations of one-size-fits-all treatments and underscores the need for personalized therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now exploring tailored approaches. By understanding each patient’s unique &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-tinnitus-therapy-could-greatly-improve-the-lives-of-40-million-us-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tinnitus profile&lt;/a&gt; and treatment goals, therapies can be customized to target specific symptoms or underlying mechanisms. Early efforts include goal-oriented counseling and personalized sound therapy, focusing on aspects such as attention retraining and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary studies have shown promise in combining behavioral interventions with digital tools. For instance, a prototype &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifesaving-smartphone-app-turns-your-phone-into-a-blood-pressure-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smartphone-based digital therapeutic&lt;/a&gt; tested alongside counseling methods showed encouraging outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates tools for relief and adaptation, guided by patient feedback and behavioral needs. As these methods evolve, they hold potential to transform the standard of care for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Audiogram for per protocol participants.

Larger, multi-center trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and scalability of digital polytherapeutics. Researchers aim to refine these tools, incorporating real-time feedback and expanding their capabilities. Combining digital therapies with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cholesterol-medications-could-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimer-s-disease-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; or other interventions may further enhance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborative effort between the University of Auckland and &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitracks.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tinnitracks&lt;/a&gt;, a German company specializing in tinnitus therapeutics, illustrates the global commitment to innovation. Tinnitracks' platform, enhanced for the New Zealand market, provided a foundation for the digital polytherapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Searchfield emphasized the importance of continuing research, saying, "We need to see if these results replicate in larger populations and assess long-term effects." By addressing these gaps, the field moves closer to a future where tinnitus is not merely managed but fundamentally mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Change in TFI total score between baseline and 12 weeks for each group.

They are, however, one of a few reasons you might consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-you-need-to-wash-rice-before-cooking-heres-the-science-71588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your grains&lt;/a&gt; in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are rice weevils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are a natural part of the environment, and just like us, they love snacking. They do indeed, as their name suggests, love rice, but they are also known to feast on crops of things like corn and other grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fossilized-insects-photonic-diamonds-reveal-the-evolution-of-structural-color-55717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weevils&lt;/a&gt; they have a delightfully noodly snoot that they use to gnaw into the hard casing of rice grains. Not only do they feed on the good stuff inside, but females will also lay their eggs inside rice grains. This is how a rice weevil’s journey to your pantry begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82965" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;What in the prison break do these rice weevil larva think they're playing at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Tomasz Klejdysz / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do weevils get into rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial rice production involves a certain amount of fumigating to try and keep the stock clear of pests, but it’s rarely 100 percent effective. The adult weevils are tiny, but the larvae are even harder to catch because they travel as stowaways tucked safely inside the rice grain. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjzjphH6CM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Deep Look&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have even tried using sound to track down infestations in rice stores by listening out for their chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feed on the inside of the rice grain until it’s just an empty shell and then crawl out as adult weevils. Once out, they can start the process of laying their own eggs and this is how even just a couple of weevils can result in an infestation if rice isn’t stored properly and goes uneaten for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjzjphH6CM??si=CCyBvOPZMranhIP8&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing rice weevils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are more common the closer you are to the source, as a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5923/j.ijaf.20140401.03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that raw milled rice contained the highest number of weevils. This number dropped off in more treated rice samples, such as that being imported and parboiled rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-storage treatment of rice contributes to the likelihood of a rice weevil infestation as well as the actual rice grains themselves, and the researchers suggest that heat sterilization can be effective in minimizing rice weevils. That said, that some weevils make it past fumigation and importation to the bags in some people’s pantries isn’t the end of the world, because eating a couple of weevils won’t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82966" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;Rice weevils won't hurt you, but if you leave your rice sitting around for months, they could destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Aurius / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are rice weevils harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils aren't always going to be in rice, and even if they were, eating a few won’t harm you. If anything, it’s just going to boost the protein content of your grains a bit, but you can sweep away rice weevils by &lt;a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/risk-at-a-glance/rice-weevils#:~:text=Consumers%20can%20remove%20rice%20weevils,to%20consume%20the%20rice%20thereafter." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where rice weevils can be harmful is in their hunger for dried goods, and if left to their own devices they’ll reduce your grains to a heap of creepy dust. This is why managing rice weevils is a bit matter of concern for large-scale producers who don’t want to lose their stock, but you the consumer with your modest bag of rice at home don’t need to worry. If you’d like to be extra careful, you can make sure to store your rice properly in an air-tight container somewhere cool and dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not want to be accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkKHRp9YO0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;eating insects&lt;/a&gt;, but there is something to be said for making these terrestrial arthropods part of the menu.

Apples also count as one of your five servings of fruits and vegetables, which should be a daily goal, says Johnson.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Since they do contain sugar, to minimize blood sugar spikes, control the portion size of apples and pair them with protein and healthy fats, such as nut butter, cheese, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-nutritional-value-of-apples" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What is the nutritional value of apples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Here’s the breakdown for &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one medium apple" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;one medium apple&lt;/a&gt; with skin, which is about three inches in diameter (roughly the size of a baseball or a small fist):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="9" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0.0"&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; 95&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.1.0"&gt;Carbohydrates:&lt;/strong&gt; 25 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.2.0"&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.4 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.3.0"&gt;Sugars:&lt;/strong&gt; 19 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.4.0"&gt;Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;.5 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.5.0"&gt;Total Fat:&lt;/strong&gt;  .3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.6"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.6.0"&gt;Sodium: &lt;/strong&gt;1.8 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.7"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.7.0"&gt;Potassium &lt;/strong&gt;194.7 mg (4% of the daily value)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="health-benefits-of-apples" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Health benefits of apples&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ahead, Johnson and Evelyn Arteche, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I., at Cooper University Health Care, break down some of the reasons to consider eating apples regularly. “It is important to note that you get more nutrition value from eating a whole apple with the skin,” Arteche says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Smoother digestion: &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber in apples can help promote bowel regularity. “Additionally, the pectin in apple skin serves as a prebiotic, supporting a healthy microbiome and overall gut health,” says Johnson. “Research indicates that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in various aspects of health, including mental well-being, disease risk, and immune function.” Studies explicitly examining the effects of apples on gut health are limited, but extensive research supports the beneficial impacts of fiber and pectin on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Weight management:  &lt;/strong&gt;“Apples can aid in weight management, particularly when consumed in place of higher-calorie, less healthy options,” says Johnson. Research specifically evaluating the effects of apple consumption on weight management in humans is limited. But, Johnson points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one 2015 study" data-node-id="13.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; which found that higher fruit and vegetable intake, as well as increased intake of apples and pears, was inversely associated with weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;High-fiber foods with high water content, such as apples, promote satiety so you feel fuller longer than if you, say, ate a cookie. “Fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness lasting longer when compared to drinking juice, for example, which does not contain much fiber,” says Arteche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Heart health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have yielded mixed results specifically regarding apple consumption and heart health. “Despite these mixed findings, substantial research links diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as seen in those following the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DASH diet" data-node-id="15.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;,” says Johnson. “Increasing fruit and vegetable intake, including apples, may contribute to cardiovascular health by supporting gut microbiome balance, promoting weight management, and providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals implicated in cardiovascular disease risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="potential-side-effects-of-eating-apples" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Potential side effects of eating apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="17" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="17.0"&gt;      &lt;strong data-node-id="17.0.1"&gt;Diarrhea:&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber in excess can cause diarrhea in some people,” says Arteche. “For example, people with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, a new colostomy, or a new ileostomy may need to avoid apples, especially apples with skin on them.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="18" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="18.0"&gt;      &lt;strong data-node-id="18.0.1"&gt;Bloating and gas:&lt;/strong&gt; People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who are sensitive to fructose may find apples difficult to tolerate. “Peeling apples can help reduce some of these symptoms because the skin contains insoluble fiber that may exacerbate digestive issues,” says Johnson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="19" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="19.0"&gt;      &lt;strong data-node-id="19.0.1"&gt;Food allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; “People who are allergic to apricot, plum, almond, peach, pear, and strawberry can also be allergic to apples and should avoid them,” says Arteche.&lt;br data-node-id="19.0.3"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="19.1"&gt;      &lt;strong data-node-id="19.1.1"&gt;Blood sugar elevation:&lt;/strong&gt; “Although apples are a healthy, low-calorie food, they are naturally high in sugar, which may contribute to blood sugar elevations, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,” says Johnson. “However, in comparison to other fruits, apples have a lower glycemic index, meaning that they do not spike blood sugar to the same extent as some other carbohydrate foods.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-bottom-line" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Apples generally are safe to eat daily unless you have a food allergy, or other medical reason to avoid them. (Always talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure whether a food is for you or not.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Due to their fiber and water content, apples promote digestive regularity and also may help you feel fuller longer, so they can play a role in weight management.

During the study period, 11,173 people were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were categorized by how much processed red meat they ate, with “low” being under 0.1 servings per day, “medium” being between 0.1 and 0.24 servings per day, and “high” being 0.25 or more servings per day. A typical serving of processed red meat is 3 ounces, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to a press release" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt; for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared with the “low” group, people with the largest consumption of processed red meat per day had a 13% higher chance of developing dementia.

Deli meat sandwiches are a regular lunch staple for many, and eggs and bacon are commonplace as well. All hope is not lost though ― swapping out processed red meat now can help reduce your dementia risk as you age. The study found that eating fish, nuts or legumes instead of processed red meat could lower dementia risk by roughly 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dylan Wint" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Dylan Wint&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, said the findings of this study are consistent with other research suggesting that people should limit red meat intake for their brain health.

[suggests] no more than four servings per week of red meat.” Wint recommends this particular diet to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet pulls from two other diets. One is the DASH diet, which &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aims to help" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;aims to help&lt;/a&gt; manage high blood pressure and boost heart health. The other is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mediterranean diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically low in saturated fats, salt and refined carbohydrates and can help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and maintain brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurology.duke.edu/profile/andrew-john-liu" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Andy Liu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://neurology.duke.edu/profile/andrew-john-liu" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Dr. Andy Liu&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology at the Duke University School of Medicine, tends to recommend the Mediterranean diet to his patients, particularly those with Alzheimer’s disease or cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Mediterranean diet falls in line very well with what they outlined in the [Neurology journal] study — you know, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, fruits and vegetables,” said Liu, who was not associated with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a number of ways that processed red meat may harm the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say there are a number of theories on how processed red meat can potentially damage the body or brain, with the exact mechanism depending on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are thoughts that saturated fat, which tends to be at higher concentrations in red meat, is not a great thing for the body or for the brain,” Wint explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing methods for processed meats are believed to be harmful, too, Wint noted. “Processed meats include preservatives that seem to be pretty bad for the brain and the body — the nitrites, in particular,” he said. “And then the bacteria that are in our gut, as they work on red meat and saturated fats, they also potentially produce toxic byproducts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, processed red meat is hard on the body, Liu said, saying that it can cause “a lot of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of what we call free radicals that can be damaging to not only the cells, but also to the DNA,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you can’t &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; have processed red meat, Liu said, but you may want to cut down on how much you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Maryna Terletska via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maryna Terletska via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;You don't have to rid your diet of all processed red meat, such as hot dogs and bacon, but it's a good idea to cut back for the sake of your brain health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A healthy diet, together with exercise and cognitive challenges, is important for your brain health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Liu, when people come into his office and ask what they can do for their cognitive health, he tells them that their diet plays a huge role. This notion is not only clear in the recent Neurology study, but in &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="various" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, too. A diet that’s low in processed red meat and high in foods like poultry, fish, legumes, fruit and nuts is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting proper nutrition isn’t the only way to ensure brain health. “I would say that the No. 1 intervention is probably physical exercise,” Wint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every physician wants you to exercise, but from a brain health perspective we know there are small molecules that help improve brain health,” Liu noted. “Specifically, there’s a growth factor that’s released when we exercise, and there’s another small molecule that’s released that helps people concentrate or focus even more.” This could be why you have an easier time focusing on work after going on a lunchtime walk or finishing a morning yoga class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wint said that he’d combine exercise with other activities, too, because “our brains are really made to be moving and to be exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to do physical exercise to move, and we want to have lots of social or mental [or] intellectual activity to do that exploration and discovery,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could include learning a new language, cooking a new dish or planting a new garden, Liu explained. “These are all brand-new things to the brain and the body, which will engage different parts of the brain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important that you manage conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, while also getting enough high-quality sleep. Poor sleep puts you at heightened risk for many health issues, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;including dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you notice cognitive changes, talk to a doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice changes to your memory, learning or any aspect of your cognition, it’s important to see a doctor sooner rather than later, Liu said, pointing to dementia as an example of a condition that needs attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As a measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico continues to grow, and other states report outbreaks of their own, some pediatricians across the U.S. say they are seeing a new trend among concerned parents: vaccine enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our call center was inundated with calls about the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine," says &lt;a href="https://pbpediatrics.com/staff/shannon-fox-levine/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Broward County, Fla. She says parents are asking if their child is up to date on their vaccinations. Or "should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/1239156786/measles-is-spreading-are-you-safe" target="_blank"&gt;spreads quickly in communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination rates are low, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise across the U.S. in recent years. Kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates &lt;/a&gt;have not bounced back to their pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Fox-Levine says the recent interest in the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — is a refreshing change in a state where vaccine hesitancy has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Florida's kindergarten vaccination rates to protect against measles&lt;a href="https://www.wusf.org/health-news-florida/2025-01-13/fewer-florida-kids-getting-routine-vaccinations" target="_blank"&gt; fell to 88.1% in the 2023-2024 school year&lt;/a&gt; — below the 95% vaccination rate considered necessary to protect against outbreaks. So, seeing a demand for vaccines is "exciting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Five U.S. states are currently experiencing measles outbreaks — New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, which has the most cases by far, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases as of Friday&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. has reported more than 480 measles &lt;/a&gt;cases in 20 states. That's more cases than in all of 2024. Almost all of the cases are in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks and concern about potential exposure is growing.  Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;used to kill hundreds of people &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. every year.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In Southern Pines, N.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://sandhillspeds.com/staff/christoph-diasio-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio&lt;/a&gt; says he's had many conversations in recent weeks with families who are interested in getting their children vaccinated against measles earlier than what's usually recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose administered between the ages of 4 and 6 years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20children%20get%20two,date%20on%20their%20MMR%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says infants as young as 6 months old can receive the MMR vaccine if they are traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diasio says families with children younger than 12 months are requesting the shot early, especially if they have travel plans for spring break.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Several families have asked what our game plan is if we get measles in our community," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, Diasio says, his patient families have delayed travel plans until their children are old enough to receive the MMR shot.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The main thing I'm hearing from my patients is not, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm so scared of that measles vaccine. It's more like, can I have one? Should I get an extra?" Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says one mother he spoke with recently was worried about the potential that unvaccinated relatives could contract measles while flying cross-country to visit her. "It's awful that this is now a discussion we have to have," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Interest in vaccinations has ramped up ahead of the spring break travel season, says &lt;a href="https://pediatricpartners.pediatrust.com/Our-Team/Susan-Sirota,-MD" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Susan Sirota&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have many patients calling us because they are traveling to either Texas or places near Texas, or states where they suspect that vaccination rates are lower than we have in Illinois," Sirota says. "Many families are requesting early MMR [vaccines]."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreaks are driving interest in vaccinations, Sirota says they're not the only factor at play. She says many families she works with follow the news, and they worry that vaccines may become less accessible in the future now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee" target="_blank"&gt; a longtime critic of vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; is the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm seeing is that there's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them," Sirota says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which protects against human papillomavirus.  HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, but can also cause other malignancies, including cancer of the throat and anus. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He has called vaccines a personal choice. NPR reached out to HHS for comment about their plans to maintain people's access to vaccines. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's too soon to tell whether anecdotal reports of vaccine enthusiasm will help counter longer-term trends toward growing vaccine hesitancy. According to one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806351/" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 5 U.S. parents are now hesitant about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And studying changes in these attitudes may be harder in the future: The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;terminated millions of dollars worth of grants&lt;/a&gt; for research to study vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;Editor’s Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This story contains mild spoilers for the current season of “The White Lotus.”&lt;/em&gt;

            “Kids! Are one of you taking my lorazepams?” Victoria Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/entertainment/parker-posey-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Parker Posey&lt;/a&gt;) asks her children in a scene from this season’s “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/entertainment/white-lotus-season-3-episode-6-recap/index.html"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0007356msg65twik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just had my prescription filled, and I can tell some are missing,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0008356mlkc48nzb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By this point in the series, the viewer knows that it’s not her children Victoria needs to worry about, it’s her husband, Timothy (Jason Isaacs).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0009356mc3h3ka75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just one episode earlier, Victoria tells Timothy that he looks tired and should take a nap (as we know, it’s actually crippling anxiety due to events unfolding at home). She offers him a pill from her prescription bottle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000c356ms6zap0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not addictive. I just take them when I need it,” she says. “You make fun of me, but they work. Not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000d356mq1an4syq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682053.html" target="_blank"&gt;lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is actually a big deal; it’s a powerful &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/benzodiazepines" target="_blank"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; used to treat anxiety disorders. And although it can be a very effective medication, it should be taken only as prescribed by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000e356moh5687cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What else do you need to know about this scene-stealing drug? I asked &lt;a href="https://drgailsaltz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/locations/newyork-presbyterian-weill-cornell-medical-center" target="_blank"&gt;New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, to share her expertise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000f356mwjgsgc0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000g356mret9tp9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to being a big fan of the show, you’re a doctor who prescribes this very medication. What did you think when you first saw it enter the storyline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000h356mdg5fhoq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought, “Wow, people get their information about psychiatric care – and all medical care – from watching shows like this, and I really hope they get it right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000i356mq44sggnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is lorazepam right for, and how does it work?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000j356mjj2koqf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam is in the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which is a depressant, and also sometimes referred to as a sedative hypnotic medication. It works by increasing a neurotransmitter in your brain called GABA, and that is what makes it somewhat sedating, which is a primary focus of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000k356mhuv85ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is often used to treat short-term high anxiety or panic – panic attacks, specifically – and even sometimes short-term sleep difficulty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000l356mnkvbzawa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Benzodiazepines across the board are highly addictive, both physiologically and psychologically, meaning that one, over time, develops a tolerance to this drug. And so the effects that you do initially get – “I have less anxiety” – will, with the same dose, wane, and you will require more of that medication to have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000m356mw8utnlq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What sorts of things do people with a lorazepam prescription need to keep in mind when they’re taking this drug?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000n356mymlb6i2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; They need to know the physical effects of this drug, which matter in terms of their safety:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cm8q8ybe50020356mkun1h6k6@published" class="list " data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
  &lt;ul data-editable="items" class="list__items list__items--ul"&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Sedation:&lt;/strong&gt; You probably shouldn’t drive a car or operate any heavy machinery.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Loss of motor control:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, machinery, driving.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Muscle relaxation:&lt;/strong&gt; In the world of anxiety, this is a good thing, but something to be aware of.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Dizziness:&lt;/strong&gt; Take your first dose in a safe place with someone around, to make sure you’re steady and not a fall risk on this medication.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            They need to be aware that if taken in large doses – essentially an overdose – you can have what’s called &lt;strong&gt;respiratory depression&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you stop breathing.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q88zlx001k356mt34ymq08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why this drug can be dangerous if you take too much or – and this is very important – take it with other medications that cause central nervous system sedation, such as alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, sleeping pills and even some old-style antihistamines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000p356mo06mpg42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the potential for abuse with lorazepam? What are the risks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000q356mxs1t0ixj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking this for anxiety, for example, as we see in the show – and I would say that Victoria appears to be taking it for social anxiety, when she’s going to go have to be with other people – which is different than Timothy, who is just flooded and in a state of utter traumatic panic and is just popping them indiscriminately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000r356mvvmtaa54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you have a positive response, that is what makes a drug psychologically addictive, which is not physiologically addictive. It’s not dangerous, but what it does do is make you want to take more, right? Because anxiety feels bad – really bad – and when you can take a medication that makes you relax and not experience the anxiety, it’s positively reinforcing. Of course you’d want to take that medication again. It made you feel better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000s356mua8k512t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone who would not be a good candidate for a lorazepam prescription?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000t356mkjzvxj7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, people who need one of these cross-reactive medications that you’re genuinely concerned about the sedative effects. Somebody who is abusing alcohol. Somebody who is abusing other drugs or has really struggled with sobriety, with serious addiction. We try to find ways around prescribing other addictive medication, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000u356mud7l3g05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Victoria is keenly aware of how many pills she has – or is supposed to have. Is this a more complicated prescription to get or fill than, say, antibiotics?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000v356m5xabzqum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz: &lt;/strong&gt;Absolutely. It’s considered a controlled substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000w356m4ox3gzpj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, physicians can prescribe lorazepam, but it is a different level of prescription where the doctor can’t just call it in on the phone. They are going to look at how many they’re prescribing you, as well as if – and how many – refills they would offer you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000x356msibrvoyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kind of like we do with opioids, if a patient is blowing through them faster than anticipated via the prescription, there needs to be discussion with the patient of, “Why? Where did that go? What is happening? Do you legitimately need more? OK, maybe this is an underdosing. Let’s discuss that. What symptoms are you having? Or are you heading toward tolerance?” And we have to think about what to do here.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000y356msulynyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; During another scene in the show, we see Timothy taking these pills while drinking heavily. That can lead to very serious interactions, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000z356mw7jpb29x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yes. Alcohol specifically interacts with benzodiazepines. They both affect the GABA system. They both can cause, on their own, respiratory depression and death – meaning you stop breathing and die. But together, they are what’s called synergistic, meaning it makes each of them have more of that effect than the two of them on their own. So it’s dangerous. That’s why they tell you not to drink when you’re taking lorazepam.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0010356m5rh9fza7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So yeah, he’s pounding them. And you know, it would not be a plot twist that Timothy doesn’t wake up in the morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0011356mhv2b5xf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the way, you see Victoria – after her lorazepam disappears, because Timothy has swiped it altogether – now drinking a lot more. And that is probably because, in addition to being stressed about [spoiler redacted], she doesn’t have the medication to cover her, so she’s drinking.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0012356m5ap8w9g8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In the same episode, Timothy steals a security guard’s gun that he forgot to lock up – and later we see him seriously contemplate suicide. While we aren’t inside (show creator, writer and director) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/entertainment/mike-white-career-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Mike White&lt;/a&gt;’s head, is suicidal ideation a known potential side effect of this drug, or do you think this is more likely the result of everything else Timothy is going through?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0013356mh0qh2hje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam by itself does not cause suicidal ideation, but it is disinhibiting – meaning thoughts that might come into your mind, that you might go, “Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that thought. Can’t have that thought,” and I push it away. Your ability to suppress it is really not there. So whatever thoughts you’re having would be disinhibited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Timothy’s situation, all by itself, would cause depression. Depression drives suicidal ideation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Another feature of lorazepam that is adding to that is basically poor cognitive functioning. Lorazepam literally slows your thoughts. It’s called thought deceleration. And in slowing your thoughts, your ability to problem-solve – which he clearly needs right now – is impaired. And so he is probably feeling like he cannot think his way out of anything right now, and this is a very dire situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that Timothy has stolen Victoria’s entire prescription bottle, is she going to experience any withdrawal symptoms? What does that look like?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0017356me1e1cipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; The question will be, how frequently was Victoria taking this lorazepam? Was this a prescription that was basically like, “Here are 30 lorazepam for the month”?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0018356mqhschidh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If she knows, “I’m going to dinner and I have to be at a resort and socialize with other people, and this makes me feel panicky, I can take a lorazepam for the dinner, and I’ll be OK,” but she’s not taking it during the day or any other time, she’s probably not addicted. She’s probably OK from a physiologic standpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0019356m9jzd7jo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone who is taking lorazepam more regularly abruptly stops this medication after they are tolerant to it or addicted – which can be a matter of just a couple weeks – you can have a spike in blood pressure. You can have a whole host of very miserable flu-like feelings, confusion, and actually, these things can rise to the level of causing death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s a very serious medication to be aware of its easy abuse potential, even in a person who has no intention of abusing it. We have yet to see in the plot whether that will come to pass, but it is something I as a psychiatrist have been concerned about as I watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001b356mzrmf0adu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people, in consultation with their doctor, will absolutely benefit from a lorazepam prescription. But not everyone with anxiety needs this medication. What are some other tried-and-true ways to manage anxiety?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001c356mkfzc7snd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you struggle with anxiety, there are a lot of coping tools that you can build into your day that will help you manage it and not get to the level of an anxiety disorder. Those run the gamut from things like a regular practice of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/breathing-stress-relief-calm-wellness/index.html"&gt;paced deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;progressive muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt;, 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; a day with your heart rate up, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;talking to somebody&lt;/a&gt; about whatever you’re anxious about. That could be someone supportive in your world. That could be a therapist. I always say that should be your first stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; A main character dies at the end of every season of “The White Lotus.” Do you want to go on the record with who you think is going to die this season? Just two episodes left!

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know why I’m even saying this exactly. It’s just some general gestalt feeling. But I feel this sad feeling like, what’s the name of Rick’s girlfriend again? Chelsea! She’s the one character that maybe I can feel some compassion for on the show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001f356mqdui3qng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chelsea is sort of a lost soul, decent person – seemingly, so far, right? Bad things keep happening to Chelsea, and she’s heralding that this really has meaning to her. She’s anticipating bad things. And so, I don’t know if they’re foreshadowing her in that way, but for me, it’s resonating as, you know – they never take out the truly horrendous people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If your voice issues continue for more than a month, Huston recommends seeing an otolaryngologist, a doctor who specializes in ear, nose, and throat conditions. You may want to see a doctor sooner if voice changes are causing discomfort or keeping you from being as social as you’d like to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your doctor can determine if you have presbyphonia or might be dealing with another voice-changing medical condition. These may include neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease or growths on your vocal cord. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/heartburn/smart-ways-to-keep-heartburn-at-bay-a1136231460/"&gt;Acid reflux&lt;/a&gt; can also affect your voice, although it primarily causes burning or pain in the chest and may be overdiagnosed as a cause of vocal changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For presbyphonia, your doctor may recommend voice therapy with a speech-language pathologist. This can teach you to project better and improve voice quality, among other benefits, Akst says. Studies suggest that this therapy can ease voice problems significantly, and because it’s noninvasive, anyone with voice changes can try it. Treatment usually lasts a few months, and insurance often covers it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When voice therapy alone doesn’t help enough, your doctor may offer a procedure to temporarily thicken your vocal cords. It uses occasional filler injections, the same type people use to achieve fuller lips. "If we can give someone puffier, bulkier cords that close more effectively, that can help the voice become stronger," Akst says. Results typically last a few months to a year, depending on the type of filler used, and insurance usually covers it.&lt;/p&gt;

Across three experiments, researchers found that people who scored high on narcissism—often associated with entitlement and self-centeredness—were less likely to cheat or lie after receiving a psychological “inoculation” that made unethical justifications seem less persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Daniel N. Jones of the University of Nevada, Reno, were interested in exploring a new approach to ethical training, particularly for individuals who are more prone to dishonesty but still care about maintaining a positive self-image. Rather than relying solely on traditional codes of ethics, the team investigated whether an “inoculation” strategy could protect against the rationalizations that often lead to unethical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a concept called “moral disengagement”—the psychological process by which people justify unethical behavior in a way that allows them to avoid feeling guilty. Examples include telling yourself that “everyone else does it,” or minimizing the harm done by saying “nobody really gets hurt.” These rationalizations act like self-persuasion, allowing people to maintain a sense of integrity even as they engage in dishonest acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the inoculation method is to warn people that they will encounter such justifications and then expose them to weakened versions of these arguments, along with counterarguments. Much like a vaccine works by training the body to resist a virus, this psychological inoculation helps the mind build up defenses against future unethical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this approach, the researchers conducted three separate experiments involving a total of 972 participants. In each study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. One group read a standard code of ethics—a type of message commonly used in schools and workplaces to promote ethical behavior. The other group read an inoculation message designed to expose and counter common rationalizations for unethical conduct. Each message took about two to four minutes to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code of ethics emphasized the importance of upholding integrity in academic and professional environments. It encouraged people to act with honesty, accountability, and responsibility, and to serve as ethical role models for others by resisting temptation, taking ownership of one’s actions, and promoting a culture of ethical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inoculation message, in contrast, warned that unethical behavior, even when it seems harmless or justified, can damage reputations and lead to serious consequences. It explained several common rationalizations people use to excuse bad behavior—such as blaming others, minimizing harm, or using euphemistic language—and countered each one to help individuals resist these faulty justifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, which involved 443 Canadian university students, participants completed a series of personality assessments and answered questions about how likely they were to engage in dishonest behavior in the future. The researchers specifically measured narcissism using two different tools, along with assessments of Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The key finding was that individuals who scored high on narcissism reported stronger ethical intentions after reading the inoculation message, compared to those who read the standard code of ethics. This effect did not appear for those low in narcissism, nor did it appear for individuals high in Machiavellianism or psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study, which included 224 American business students, took things a step further by measuring actual dishonest behavior. Participants were given a virtual coin-flipping task where they could cheat to earn extra exam credit. If they flipped the coin once and accepted the result, they were considered honest. However, the software allowed them to flip multiple times until they got a favorable outcome. The researchers found that narcissistic participants who received the inoculation were less likely to cheat than those who received the ethics code. Again, no such pattern emerged for the other two traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third study followed 305 participants over time to see whether the inoculation had lasting effects. Participants completed the same kind of initial reading task and were then contacted a week later to report how many lies they had told in the past week. The results showed that individuals high in narcissism who had received the inoculation reported fewer lies, suggesting that the intervention had some durability. Interestingly, this delayed effect was tied more to reductions in dishonest behavior than increases in self-reported honesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all three studies, the inoculation approach consistently influenced only those high in narcissism. The researchers argue that this makes sense given what is known about narcissistic individuals. People high in narcissism often feel entitled and are motivated by personal gain, but they also care deeply about how they are perceived by others and want to maintain a positive self-image. This internal conflict makes them more likely to rely on rationalizations when they behave unethically—and more receptive to an intervention that targets those rationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, individuals high in psychopathy often lack guilt or concern for others and are unlikely to experience internal conflict about their actions, while those high in Machiavellianism may see dishonesty as a strategic tool rather than something to justify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution that the inoculation approach is not universally effective. In fact, they found evidence that it might backfire for people who are already internally motivated to be honest or who score low on narcissism. In these cases, exposure to the inoculation message—which highlights common rationalizations—might inadvertently increase awareness of justifications for unethical behavior, even if that wasn’t the intended effect. The same unintended effect was found among participants with low internal motivation to be honest. For these individuals, the inoculation message seemed to prompt more dishonesty compared to the ethics code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to ethics training may not be optimal. Instead, ethical interventions might need to be customized based on personality traits and motivational factors. People who are already motivated to be ethical may benefit more from standard reminders and ethical codes, while those who struggle with self-serving tendencies—but still care about being seen as good people—may respond better to inoculation messages that challenge their ability to justify dishonest behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this research, we found that individuals high in narcissism behaved more ethically when they were exposed to inoculation that prevented them from engaging in moral disengagement tactics,” the researchers concluded. “This finding was exclusive to narcissism and did not apply to the other two Dark Triad traits. Furthermore, the benefits of inoculation seemed exclusive to narcissism, such that those low in narcissism were not more ethical in response to inoculation. In such cases (i.e., high dispositional ethics) merely repeating a code of ethics may be the best approach. Thus, we find not only does inoculation depend on the target audience in this context, but also that individuals high in narcissism may behave ethically under the right circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672241276562" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Inoculating Against Moral Disengagement Creates Ethical Adherence for Narcissism&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daniel N.

A test ordered by a veterinarian came back positive for bird flu. Within days, Kira’s condition had deteriorated — she became lethargic and had trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After several trips to the vet and emergency room in Portland, Oregon, where Hanson lives, he made the painful decision to put Kira down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was the happiest cat I’ve ever had,” he said. “You’d walk past her and she’d do a little back flip and get on her back so you could rub her belly. She did that in the hospital the last night… She just very lethargically flopped on her back so we could rub her belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The manufacturer of the pet food, Wild Coast Pet Foods, subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/voluntary-recall-wild-coast-raw-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-raw-pet-food-because-possible" target="_blank"&gt;recalled lots of the formula&lt;/a&gt; Kira had consumed due to potential bird flu contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson filed a lawsuit against the company earlier this month, alleging that it had failed to disclose the risk of bird flu in its raw pet food. He is seeking roughly $8,000 to cover the cost of Kira’s veterinary bills. Wild Coast did not respond to a request for comment. In &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" target="_blank"&gt;a letter to customers&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it had “transitioned to fully cooked poultry recipes to eliminate any potential risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg" alt="Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tim Hanson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, 126 domestic cats in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;have been infected with bird flu&lt;/a&gt; since 2022. Around half of those cases were recorded this year, and many were exposed through food or milk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We see continued reports of cats with bird flu infection from across the country, and it’s kept increasing in the past months,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In cats, bird flu tends to be swift and lethal. Although the overall risk to indoor cats is low, Kuchipudi and other experts who study or diagnose the infections say the threat is mounting. With bird flu spreading rampantly among poultry and cattle, there is a constant opportunity for the virus to enter the raw food supply. And while there’s no evidence yet that cats can transmit bird flu to people, the potential increases as more cats get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have the evidence, but it doesn’t mean that it may not have happened, or it can’t happen,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;At least 3 pet food recalls in 4 months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most pet food is heated to a high enough temperature to kill pathogens before it’s packaged, but bird flu can linger in raw food if it’s sourced from infected poultry — for instance, from chickens that were culled due to an outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The animals that were depopulated could potentially have ended up in the food chain for pets,” said Laura Goodman, an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. “It’s not uncommon for substandard meat to end up in the pet food chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the last four months, at least three pet food manufacturers have recalled batches containing raw poultry. The Food and Drug Administration in January &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/cat-and-dog-food-manufacturers-required-consider-h5n1-food-safety-plans" target="_blank"&gt;warned manufacturers using uncooked meat&lt;/a&gt; to reassess their food safety plans in light of the recent cat illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other cats have been exposed to bird flu on dairy farms, likely from drinking raw milk from infected cows. And in some instances, outdoor cats have picked up the virus directly from dead birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm#contribAff" target="_blank"&gt;report in February&lt;/a&gt; also described two indoor cats that lived with dairy farm workers and contracted bird flu. The research suggests that “individuals who are working on dairies or hauling milk have the potential to carry virus into their house on their clothing or on their shoes, and in turn the cats then are exposed,” said Kimberly Dodd, dean of the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who coauthored the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is no active surveillance for bird flu in healthy cats, so cases could be underreported. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11528901/#sec26" target="_blank"&gt;study of stray cats&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands found that nearly 12% were positive for bird flu antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We may be only testing the sickest cats or one cat from a household. It’s very likely that there have been many cases out there that the cat was not brought to a veterinarian or testing wasn’t done,” said Kristy Pabilonia, director of veterinary diagnostic laboratories at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pabilonia oversaw the diagnostic testing for a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hairless_leo/" target="_blank"&gt;hairless cat named Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;, who was found to have bird flu in January. Leo’s owner, Steve Werfelmann, said his cat had eaten chicken-based raw pet food from the company Savage Pet, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/savage-pet-recalls-savage-cat-food-chicken-large-and-small-boxes-because-possible-bird-flu-health?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJx4hleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUGDboc0G0uQ72RfJYtFDWs67vQGhADUsWqPNkQWjIBCbssoHvywlAjrdA_aem_pwkkhTKW7ScKMDWox9C35A" target="_blank"&gt;recalled dozens of batches&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg" alt="Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Steve Werfelmann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When we adopted him, that was the recommended food” for his skin, Werfelmann said. “But then talking to the vet and going through this process, they actually told us there’s no real scientific evidence to back up raw food being better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Savage Pet referred NBC News to &lt;a href="https://savagecatfood.com/avian-influenza/" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt;, which says “all of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed for human consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current bird flu strain, which began spreading among wild birds and poultry in the U.S. in 2022, often causes severe neurological symptoms in cats, such as seizures and blindness, as well as difficulty breathing and discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cats may be seen circling or having a head tilt or just acting very abnormally. Some of those clinical signs are very similar to what we see in rabies,” Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Leo didn’t show neurological symptoms, aside from wobbliness in his back legs, Werfelmann said. Instead, his main symptoms were fever, lethargy and not eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We thought he was going to die,” Werfelmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced this month that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/photos/colorado-has-detected-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-h5n1-in-11-domestic/1180459680757615/" target="_blank"&gt;11 domestic cats there&lt;/a&gt; had gotten bird flu from raw poultry or pet food. Leo was the only one to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘It’s the milk’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand what makes bird flu so deadly in cats. The virus is highly fatal to birds but seems to affect cats more severely than some other mammals. Far fewer cases have been recorded in dogs, and though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1,000 dairy herds have been affected&lt;/a&gt;, the disease tends to be milder in cows. In people, only one of the 70 cases recorded in the U.S. has been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kuchipudi’s &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#abstract" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has identified receptors throughout cats’ bodies that allow them to be infected by a broad range of flu viruses, including H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you examine these animals, the virus is everywhere in the body,” he said. “It causes a systemic infection that is potentially very severe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Joseph Journell lost two of his cats, Alexander and Tuxedo, to bird flu just days apart in November. He had been giving them raw milk, believing it to contain extra nutrients. A third cat, Big Boy, also got sick after drinking the milk and wound up in critical condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg" alt="Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Whatever’s wrong with Big Boy is the same thing wrong with Tuxsie and then obviously the same thing wrong with Alexander,’” said Journell, who lives in San Bernardino, California. “It’s the milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Big Boy tested positive for bird flu via a urine sample in December.

His lawyer sent a letter in January to the owner of Raw Farm, indicating Journell’s intent to recoup more than $16,000 in veterinary expenses, lost wages and caretaker fees for Big Boy. They hope to mediate the situation with the company outside of court but plan to file suit if that’s not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;A threat to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the veterinary office learned about Kira’s raw food diet, Hanson said, they suspected bird flu right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They immediately put on their PPE,” Hanson said. “I was taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although there’s some evidence that cats can pass bird flu to each other, there’s no evidence so far that they have transmitted the virus to people. However, the more the virus spreads in cats, the more opportunities it has to mutate and get better at spreading to humans. Outdoor cats, in particular, could serve as a transmission “bridge” between wild animals and domestic pets or humans, Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vet-catches-bird-flu-cat-new-york-n699316" target="_blank"&gt;a veterinarian at a New York City animal shelter&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for a different strain of bird flu, H7N2, after contact with sick cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to be aware of these ongoing circulations that could potentially complicate the disease transmission and also [pose] a risk to human health,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson said he was tested for bird flu after Kira died and was negative. In his cat’s final days, he said, he wore an N95 mask around her and washed his clothes upon returning home from the animal hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He hopes his story will serve as a warning to other cat owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I don’t want any more cats dying,” he said. “Hopefully people can learn from Kira’s passing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE96cER2UzAxN1JuaVhkWGRoV0NMUTJyNmxNLXFhckZ0eWpIRk5SbC1UOV9OLVBwdmhVekxFWkcxVTFVZGpkQXFlV05KbzR3czRXRXdORGJjQV84TkY5R1RCX1YyRDBrcUZsek1nandHcVJZM1hWMFHSAVZBVV95cUxOTDNlU05mM2RsaHl2aWZEdUlIeTFfR2F1dXo2eDJPNXREZDhIYlZUNHlsMDVQRHl2UEZyaWk4VXhBNWNwX1ZuSTFjb2g1U09Pc3BJNlBJUQ</guid></item><item><title>Some argue AI therapy can break down mental health stigma — others warn it could make it worse - Salon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxQbHNJLUE2elBYUG1pclVrZXQxZG1FMjJ4YkRlX1IzTmN4aXVCWGczODhPT0hNVkN5WVJ6c2JUODl3SzBzQ0VOQVRYWTJJS2laeWRMbjBUQmNiQXJSNTRCdWpnOG9YbXhuajR3UnJaMWh2dXpyMzB2NjVkRFlPdlpLUjVVWlBfX2VRSXpWRkJNZWRFV0FoT1oyeVM1aENJMDZ2OWZsSmNFY1Bya2p2ME1IajJNSklWTllURHlMNUgyMUowenhVMWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Viki tried talk therapy with a couple of therapists to process past &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/10/23/wild-animals-can-experience-trauma-and-adversity-too_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt;. But after about a year, she didn’t feel like it was going anywhere and hadn’t built up a rapport with either therapist. Currently out of work and unable to afford traditional counseling sessions, she decided to try using an &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/artificial_intelligence" target="_blank"&gt;AI chatbot&lt;/a&gt; to help her process her feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s free, and I can do it whenever,” Viki, 30, who is using her first name only for privacy reasons, told Salon in a phone interview. “That’s such a huge help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of AI chatbots designed to offer therapeutic support have emerged in recent years, with some &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/ai-chatbot-los-angeles-schools.html"&gt;school districts even trying to implement them&lt;/a&gt;. One company, Wysa, was &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220512005084/en/Wysa-Receives-FDA-Breakthrough-Device-Designation-for-AI-led-Mental-Health-Conversational-Agent"&gt;granted&lt;/a&gt; a special designation from the Food and Drug Administration that expedites the process toward approving it as a medical device for people with depression and anxiety related to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These models can be trained to analyze, reflect and respond to people’s emotions and are often free to use, or at least far cheaper than human therapists. As AI therapy continues to grow, it may be able to expand access to mental health treatment for the millions of people who cannot afford traditional therapy. It could also break down longstanding stigmas surrounding mental health — as seeking help becomes something you can do at the touch of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that patients worried about social stigma would feel more comfortable asking an AI for help rather than a [general practitioner] or a human psychotherapist,” wrote ethicist Alberto Giubilini and philosopher Francesca Minerva, in a 2023 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-023-09932-3" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. “For patients who are seriously concerned about being stigmatized because of their mental illness, the alternative might be between being cured by an AI and not being cured at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if users are consciously aware that they are interacting with a machine, they can develop feelings and relationships toward them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human connection generated between a counselor and their client has been shown to be &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/11/ce-corner-relationships"&gt;as effective — if not more effective — than the therapy itself&lt;/a&gt;, said David Luxton, a clinical psychologist and an affiliate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. However, AI chatbots can be programmed to mimic certain human tendencies, like having a sensitive and empathetic understanding of a patient and giving positive affirmations. They can even “forget” something, just as a human would, so that you have to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that they can really replace humans,” Luxton told Salon in a phone interview. “But should they, is really the question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if users are consciously aware that they are interacting with a machine, they can develop feelings and relationships toward them. This could take the form of feeling angry or frustrated when a chatbot doesn’t understand a prompt. Or, in some cases, people have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/ai-companions-friendship-rcna194735"&gt;developed relationships with chatbots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the American Psychological Association &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/ai-therapists-chatbots.html"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; federal regulators of the risks associated with AI chatbots, citing multiple cases in which AI chatbots were “masquerading” as therapists. In &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after interacting with the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company in question has said it updated the code since this case occurred, and most chatbots now have a disclaimer embedded in their programming that warns users that they are not talking with a licensed professional. Still, ensuring that safeguards are in place should this largely unregulated technology go awry is crucial, Luxton said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they don’t catch when a person is espousing intent to harm themselves or someone else, if that is not explicit, and the system doesn’t answer the questions, then you are missing an opportunity for an intervention, which is required by law as a licensed professional like myself,” Luxton said. “If I know that someone makes a threat to harm someone else, I have a duty to warn or inform, or report in some cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, talking with AI chatbots for mental health care instead of seeing a human could also increase isolation and loneliness, worsening the mental health symptoms patients are experiencing in the first place, said Şerife Tekin, a mental health ethics researcher at the University of Texas San Antonio and author of "&lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2464/9780367518110" target="_blank"&gt;Reclaiming the Self in Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;." This isolation could also worsen stigmas associated with mental health care if people are talking about their emotions with these programs instead of with other humans, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the therapeutic processes in the clinical context is to help patients see they don’t need to be perfect, that anyone can experience things, and it’s okay to ask for help,” Tekin told Salon in a phone interview. “I think [AI therapy] might actually increase the stigma.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots that are trained to be empathetic and possess more human qualities might also start to run into additional problems. In one &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01512-6#author-information"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month, researchers primed ChatGPT to act like “a human being with emotions.” Afterward, they told the chatbot a series of traumatic events and then tested how its mental health was doing using a common questionnaire for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reported that the chatbots were far more anxious after researchers shared traumatic events compared to when they shared mundane information about a vacuum cleaner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all. Researchers also told the chatbot to perform some meditation and mindfulness exercises, like imagining it was sitting at the beach and listening to the sound of the waves, or refocusing its attention to the “body” through breathing. This significantly reduced anxiety levels, said Dr. Ziv Ben-Zion, a researcher at Yale University, who is currently transitioning to Haifa University in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s the first time that someone has shown that we can not only induce or cause anxiety, but also to regulate it afterwards,” Ben-Zion told Salon in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begs the question: If AI chatbots are programmed to become more and more like humans, can they handle the emotional burdens we share? Or will one day AI therapists need their own AI therapists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course, there are things that are unique to humans, but tools are being developed that have access to all the data in the world and can speak with humans and learn from that,” Ben-Zion said. “There are lots of studies now in different domains that really show they can mimic, replicate, and do all kinds of things that we see as human.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some middle ground, where patients can use AI chatbots to supplement therapy with a person by journaling or processing things that come up between sessions. Viki, for example, is doing a specific therapeutic technique called &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/12/07/breaking-down-to-not-break-down-this-therapy-technique-splits-the-self-but-does-it-actually-help/" target="_blank"&gt;internal family systems (IFS) or “parts work,”&lt;/a&gt; in which people separate out various “parts” of the self — like a fear response from a past trauma or a supportive part that pushes you to achieve your goals — from the capital-S “Self.” She supplements her own reading and work with this technique by talking with &lt;a href="https://www.ifsbuddy.chat/"&gt;IFS Buddy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, she experiences a lot of self-doubt about whether she is using the right tool or asking the right questions, she said. On the other hand, she felt similarly during therapy with a human as well, which is what led her to begin studying this technique and doing the work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to figure it out on my own… and it gets overwhelming,” Viki said. “But it’s not like the therapist is healing you with the relationship that you have with them. With IFS, you build that relationship in yourself, and that is healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, unlike sugar, it does not trigger hormones that signal fullness, potentially leading to increased hunger, cravings and a higher risk of overeating and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consider swapping sucralose-rich snacks for naturally sweet options like fruit.

            When health workers stopped visiting her home in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/asia/pakistan-balochistan-train-hostage-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to administer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/tuberculosis-outbreak-kansas/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; medication, Ratna Jamni began dragging herself to a clinic “step by painful step, when even standing feels impossible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0002356mlympy5wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 40-year-old had been receiving treatment and mental health support for months at home after contracting drug-resistant TB, but those visits have all stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0003356mmru5vbcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every trip is painful, exhausting and humiliating. I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” she told CNN via the Dopasi Foundation, a Pakistan-based NGO whose &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/politics/trump-admin-terminates-syria-white-helmets-funding/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;-funded programs helped provide her health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slh4r20000356mt3hs59qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The journey is long, my body is weak, and every breath feels heavier than the last. I wonder if it’s even worth it. I wish this suffering would end – either the help returns or I no longer have to endure this pain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sli0o70009356me4h0lmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection usually found in the lungs, remains the world’s top infectious killer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;causing 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhyxb0007356me837im0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the right health care and drugs, TB is treatable and preventable. Without treatment, it has a death rate of close to 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slicgy000c356md6gyznzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like that of millions of other TB patients across the world, Jamni’s treatment was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It has now been interrupted by the Trump administration’s sudden freezing, and subsequent cutting, of vast swathes of the agency’s funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljcl7000h356mloa01qnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aid groups and doctors warn that these cuts are likely to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths and a rise in TB infections worldwide, including in the US itself; and create the conditions for an extremely drug-resistant form of the disease to spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljaf6000f356mpc6g44ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, more than 11,000 additional TB patients are estimated to have died in the two months since almost all USAID funding froze on January 24, according to a model built by UN-affiliated organization Stop TB Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slji1e000k356m6e50bv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB infections are also expected to increase by 28-32% globally this year as a result of the cuts, according to a memo issued by a top USAID official, Nicholas Enrich, who was placed on administrative leave. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000p356m7dad3rtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Department, which now handles queries for USAID, told CNN that certain TB programs are “active today in more than a dozen countries,” in line “with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio’s exemption for life-saving humanitarian assistance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000q356mp6d5wu2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These programs are helping to find and cure hundreds of thousands of cases of tuberculosis by providing access to low-cost, life-saving testing and medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljv94000n356m8iu2qiky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US funding was an integral part of the global TB response, distributing grants both directly to 24&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national governments whose countries have high rates of the disease and via international or local non-governmental organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkd6g000v356mo3m0kol5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            USAID was deeply enmeshed in global HIV/AIDS health care too, and TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkp1t000y356mcsnj42zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike previous changes in funding flows, which came with prior warning, this freeze is unprecedented in both its scale and abruptness, meaning that it’s “very difficult for these countries overnight to find the resources” to plug the gap, Dr. Lucica Ditiu, CEO of the UN-affiliated Stop TB Partnership, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0013356m6s2byd5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while local aid groups call for a shift to domestic funding, the situation right now is deteriorating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0014356m49tdoyq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 27 countries worst affected by the cuts, that funding gap is leading to “crippling breakdowns in their TB response with devastating consequences,” WHO said in a statement on March 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll1ry0011356mmz1xm2nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise nature of the impact has varied worldwide, depending on the role USAID played in the network of funding streams contributing to each country’s TB program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slln0i0019356miff8tjhv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In almost half of Mozambique, for example, no one can currently be diagnosed with TB, since US funding supported its lab networks and system that transported samples of spit and mucus, Ditiu said. Some programs, like Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility, which facilitates global access to relatively cheap drugs, have had some funding restored by temporary waivers, Ditiu said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sllky80017356mjuscco4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But more have not, and nine countries are struggling to procure TB drugs, threatening patients’ access to them, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slluu8001c356m2kqxndvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health workers based in Cambodia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa and Eswatini told CNN the biggest cuts to their programs were mostly in active case-finding, which allows for earlier diagnosis to stem the spread of disease, and in community outreach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            One such USAID-funded program in Cambodia, run by local HIV and TB organization KHANA, had screened more than 780,000 people for TB in remote areas, traced more than 16,000 close contacts of TB patients and supported more than 800 patients with multi-drug-resistant TB during the past five years, according to its executive director, Choub Sok Chamreun.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm43r001f356mwjdmteuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that work has now stopped. As a result, the number of new TB cases reported in the region has dropped from about 650-850 per month to just 250 in February, meaning that hundreds are going undiagnosed and without care, Chamreun told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slmfz9001k356mga3nnwly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means that people don’t come to services. It means that the infection continues to spread over the community … it means that the aim to end TB by 2030 is impossible,” he said, referencing the UN’s goal to largely eliminate the disease by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sln919001n356m95inns92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, another case-finding program supported by USAID in 27 of Pakistan’s districts has ceased, along with the means of transporting sputum samples, and community monitoring that aims to identify any barriers to TB treatment, Kinz ul Eman, CEO of the Dopasi Foundation, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001s356mcm4yvid1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sudden cuts also mean immediately laying off field health workers who “actually risked their life to support your project activity, to support their community,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001t356makt7r4oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB disproportionately affects marginalised communities and people living in poverty for whom government health care is less accessible, making such outreach even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnkoh001q356mz6yyqs1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such program, overseen by Dr. Steven John, an official at the Ministry of Health in Adamawa State, Nigeria, was implementing TB health care for nomadic populations there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slo20g001y356mfslcy4dl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the funding freeze, his program can no longer reach the 60-70% of the community who have yet to access its services, even as people there “approach the organization (saying) ‘When are you coming?’” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnw50001w356mnzamp58i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suddenly restricting access to drugs and treatment also creates the conditions for a mutated, multi-drug-resistant strain of TB to thrive as patients partway through a four- or six-month treatment regimen may be forced to stop taking them, aid groups and doctors say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloqc50025356mn8p8gc71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anytime you cease a treatment in the middle of the course of therapy, you promote the selection of drug resistance and people then become contagious again to others in their community,” explained Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor at Emory University who previously served as director of the division for tuberculosis elimination at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slojge0023356mbbdz6xi0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Very few drugs can treat such an extreme form of TB. “You create, basically, a bug which is virtually resistant to what we have,” said Ditiu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002a356m3v4gkfrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That risk is magnified since a lot of USAID’s funding, especially in Africa, focused on supporting people living with multi-drug-resistant TB, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002b356mtt3nwla8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And anecdotal reports of patients stopping their courses of medication are already emerging. One patient in Uganda started sharing her medication with her husband, meaning they are both taking half the prescribed amount, Bruce Tushabe, an official at advocacy group the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002c356mbj9urm7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another person who used to get medication from a specialist, now-closed clinic can’t stand in the queues at the general clinics due to the stigma TB patients still face, Tushabe added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002d356mojec29i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB rates rise globally, they are likely to increase in the US as well, said Castro, while pointing out that the country still has one of the world’s lowest rates of the disease at 2.9 cases per 100,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloss80028356mkunqgsrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, warning signs are lighting up – in January, the Kansas City metro area was hit by a wave of TB, causing dozens of illnesses and at least two deaths. And childhood TB cases in Europe rose by 10% in 2023, showing that transmission of the disease is still ongoing, WHO said on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp68o002g356mj725kj5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The irony,” Castro added, “is that these disinvestments end up resulting at higher cost to recover and mitigate the damage done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My wonderful consultant, Monika Kaushik, has an open mind to a multidisciplinary approach for treatment, so she was fully supportive of my plan to explore all avenues in an attempt to live more healthily and give my body the best chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as my extraordinary group of clinical practitioners, I gathered a team of people whom I dubbed my “wise counsel” to guide me on this journey. Of course there was Calen, who also recommended I have weekly “pep talks” with Katie Boyd, a nutritionist who helps women tackle health issues through diet and meditation (I practised a guided meditation daily to lower my stress levels). Exercise is vital and while I couldn’t run after the op, I certainly took lots of walks in nature, which grounded me. Writing a diary was another great outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homoeopathic doctor Philippa Fibert prescribed &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/magnesium-health-benefits-body-supplements-immunity/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; tablets and spray to help with my sleep, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The guilt that surrounds cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s common amongst people with cancer is that they feel guilty for their lifestyles; I, too blamed myself. For years, I’d given my body a hard journey. Ten pregnancies, five children, smoking in my 40s (a cigarette was a treat once the children were in bed), drinking in my 50s (a glass of wine to unwind at the end of a long day). And I’d never considered my sugar intake really, often buying sweets for the children for the journey to school. No wonder my system said: “Stop! I’ve had enough!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, four years ago, I was having an awful time with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/mastectomy-breast-cancer/"&gt;the menopause&lt;/a&gt;. I had a terrible sleep pattern and dreadful night sweats. When a girlfriend suggested trying hormone replacement therapy (HRT), I jumped at the chance. My gynaecologist discussed the option of gel or implants. Knowing how forgetful I was, I opted for the implant, which only needed to be changed every six months. I wish I hadn’t. I’m convinced that taking additional hormones was not right for me. Some believe, and I’m among them, that it may have contributed to or even caused my cancer. But it’s important to move on and deal with what you have – not dwell in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until my cancer diagnosis, I’d paid lip service to alternative therapists and then go straight back to my old, bad patterns of living. Now I felt I’d had a slap on the head from God. It was time to stop procrastinating and do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, Monika, planned to just remove the 2.5cm lump in my breast. But first, I had to have my coil and implant taken out, followed by a biopsy to see whether or not the two other nodules that had been discovered in my breast were cancerous. And then an MRI scan. The biopsy, in which a fine needle was injected into my breast without an anaesthetic, was the most painful of all my procedures, and I bled for five days, but it meant a sample of my tissue could be looked at under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/secondary-breast-cancer/"&gt;cancer hadn’t spread&lt;/a&gt; outside the breast, Monika said it could not be saved because of the extent of the disease, and the operation took place last September, a day after my 61st birthday. After taking the anaesthetic, I had one last glance at my left breast, said my goodbyes, and cursed it slightly, as it had always been a problem feeding the children and never really behaved. I also reflected on how lucky I am that I could have my tumour removed – many are not so fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in the theatre for four hours, though thankfully, it was quite straightforward. As I came to after the operation, nurses came and went, but I just continued in a calm trance. Of course, it may have been the drugs, but honestly, it felt like a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a month after the mastectomy, I went for half an hour of hyperbaric oxygen therapy every day, which involved lying in an oxygen chamber, to increase oxygen in my blood and help the healing process. I felt everything was worth a go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after my operation, with Phil once again by my side, I went to see Monika, who talked me through the results of the biopsy. “It hasn’t gone into your lymph nodes,” she said. “You will need radiotherapy, and you may need chemo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were good signs, I was assured. I was told I needed to wait for a year until I could undergo reconstructive surgery, which I’d really wanted to have as soon as possible. Losing part of your body is hard to deal with mentally – my way of coping was to make light of it.&lt;/p&gt;

With the longitudinal cohort, they put the group on a very low-calorie ketogenic diet for 180 days and took blood samples baseline, after 30 days on the very low-calorie ketogenic diet, and at the 180-day endpoint to assess biological age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the normal weight and obesity weight age groups, the researchers found that people in the obesity group had higher biological age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with obesity had an accelerated epigenetic age of 4.4 years, while people in the normal-weight group exhibited a deceleration of 3.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this discrepancy in aging between normal-weight and obesity groups was concerning, the researchers established with their longitudinal cohort that it is possible to reverse the aging process through nutritional choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When analyzing blood samples taken at 30 days on nutritional ketosis – when the body is thought to be in the process of burning fat – the participants had an age deceleration of 6.1 years. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 180-day endpoint, this participants sustained age deceleration, with an average age deceleration of 6.2 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that being in nutritional ketosis is responsible for decelerated aging. They noted that levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body produced during &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180858" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, were linked to slower biological aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to experiencing an age deceleration, people on the very low-calorie ketogenic diet saw improvements in glucose and insulin levels, which is significant since people with obesity are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists established that obesity and biological aging are connected and that it can potentially be reversed. The researchers noted that larger studies should be conducted to “reinforce and consolidate the role of ketone bodies in the epigenetic regulation of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key factors through which obesity affects aging is by inducing greater inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction,” Ali, who was not involved in this research, said when explaining how obesity can accelerate biological age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stress and inflammation cause increased breakdown of critical cellular functions in the body, leading to accelerated aging,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for the study results, Ali found them interesting but was not convinced that the very low-calorie ketogenic diet alone was responsible for the age deceleration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very low-calorie ketogenic diet does show benefits, but any weight loss leading to a patient achieving a healthy weight has been shown to improve all medical conditions and prolong the life span; it is difficult to definitively conclude that the type of diet is independent of the weight loss,” noted Ali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drtsfullhealthwellness.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Tiffany Marie Hendricks&lt;/a&gt;, MD double-board certified in family and lifestyle medicine, also weighed in on the study for &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.

Hendricks had some concerns about the safety and sustainability of this approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Translating very low-calorie ketogenic diet findings into clinical guidelines faces several challenges,” she told us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hendricks explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very low-calorie ketogenic diet involves severe calorie restriction (typically [under] 800 kcal/day [kilocalories per day]) and high fat intake, which may pose risks like nutrient deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or ketoacidosis if not properly monitored.

Tiny and mute beneath the stacked rows of medical students, she is paraded for their benefit by a consultant psychiatrist some 44 years her senior. It is 1966 – the peak of Swinging 60s’ hedonism, liberalism and youthful counterculture – but in a locked psychiatric ward in London’s Royal Waterloo hospital, unspeakable violations are being inflicted upon patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The perpetrator-in-chief, William Sargant, is the subject of thriller writer Jon Stock’s first nonfiction book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sleep-room-9780349128894/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Sleep Room: A Very British Medical Scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. One of the most notorious figures in British psychiatry, Sargant initially wished to be a physician. He pivoted to psychiatry after one of his earliest pieces of research met with a humiliating reception at the Royal College of Physicians, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown and spend time in a psychiatric hospital himself. At this time – the 1930s – effective psychiatric treatments were virtually non-existent. Serious mental illness usually led to lifelong incarceration in an asylum. But the therapeutic nihilism of psychiatry was shifting towards optimism. Psychiatrists began experimenting with so-called “heroic” therapies, such as putting patients into insulin comas or giving them electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to try to “reset” their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"books","tags":[{"id":"books/scienceandnature","type":"Keyword","title":"Science and nature books"},{"id":"books/series/observer-book-of-the-week","type":"Series","title":"Observer book of the week"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"society/psychiatry","type":"Keyword","title":"Psychiatry"},{"id":"books/healthmindandbody","type":"Keyword","title":"Health, mind and body books"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"Tone","title":"Reviews"},{"id":"profile/rachel-clarke2","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Clarke","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel-Clarke.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=51c29f213037939471b9112192dce124","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel_Clarke,_R.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2e37d5bd253b6ea6021f4af2337fa608"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"Publication","title":"The Observer"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"The New Review"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Books"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"Tracking","title":"Observer New Review"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"books/2025/mar/30/the-sleep-room-by-jon-stock-a-very-british-medical-scandal-william-sargant-review-a-horrifying-study-of-medical-abuse","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"prebidCriteo":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"abTheTradeDesk":true,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant firmly believed that a broken brain was no different to any other damaged organ or limb, and best fixed with aggressive physical treatment. Not for him the namby-pamby chitchat of Freud’s “sofa merchants” and their spurious talking cures. Rather, psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia could all be cured with excessive doses of drugs and electricity, or, if they failed, with surgical lobotomy. Sargant’s patients were sequestered away behind locked doors on the top floor of the hospital. The most infamous part of his ward was a six-bedded area known as the Sleep Room. Here, the patients, nearly all of whom were female, were drugged into long-term stupors, being roused from their beds only to be fed, washed or given innumerable doses of ECT. A typical “narcosis” treatment comprised three months of near-total unconsciousness, after which time the patient had often been reduced to a “walking zombie” with permanent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy, some of the accounts made my skin crawl&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; is peppered with haunting first-hand accounts of horrific treatment at the hands of William Sargant. The actor Celia Imrie, for example, the aforementioned child, was admitted under Sargant’s care because she was close to death from anorexia nervosa. She recounts being forced to drink such large doses of chlorpromazine – the first antipsychotic - that she dribbled, shook uncontrollably and found her hair in clumps on her pillow. She was injected daily with enough insulin to make her drowsy, weak, sweaty and near comatose. She remembers other women around her having huge rubber plugs jammed between their teeth before the high-voltage electricity of ECT was sent through their temples, and their bodies “shuddered and jerked” with the “scent of burning hair and flesh”. Sometimes a patient would reappear on the ward with their head thickly bandaged, scarcely able to walk after being lobotomised. Amid the moans, screams and stale stench of sleep, Imrie recalls the nurses reporting her own resistance to the drugs to Sargant, to which he ominously responded: “every dog has his breaking point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To say that these stories are difficult to read is an understatement. Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy – permanently subduing patients by gouging out parts of their frontal lobes – some of the accounts made my skin crawl. It is to Stock’s great credit that he places patient testimony centre stage, allowing several patients to tell their stories at length in their own, unedited words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant himself is depicted as a sinister, all-powerful, “simian” monster who ran his ward as a personal fiefdom in which he could pursue, unchecked, his conviction that effective treatments worked by physically erasing and reprogramming disturbed minds. A darker benefit of his Sleep Room was the absolute power it gave him over his charges. Once rendered unconscious, a patient could be subjected to treatments they might otherwise never have consented to, such as scores, or even hundreds, of doses of ECT. As Sargant himself put it: “What is so valuable is that they generally have no memory about the actual length of the treatment or the number of ECT used.” Before long, colleagues had nicknamed him “Bill the Brain Slicer” and “Sargant the Shock”. His fascination with techniques for brainwashing led to speculation that he may have collaborated with the CIA’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MKUltra&lt;/a&gt; programme into mind control, though no definitive proof of this is provided by Stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7257b788-1e22-4a45-a5a3-47a0c96d5176" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The Royal Waterloo hospital for children and women, in London, where Sargant undertook his ‘narcosis’ treatments.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Panoramic Images/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At least five of Sargant’s patients died during narcosis. The dangers of artificially prolonged sleep included deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores, infection and paralysis of the gut, all of which could be fatal. Though the disproportionate number of female patients under his care was not, in itself, evidence of misogyny, his treatment of particular individuals locates him firmly within that psychiatric tradition. He was perfectly willing, for example, to regard female independence as synonymous with madness and in need of social correction. One young woman was dispatched to Sargant by her wealthy businessman father after she fell in love with an “unsuitable” man in the 1960s. Sargant “helped” the situation by subjecting her to months of narcosis, ECT, antipsychotics, antidepressants and the “truth drug”, sodium amytal, after which she was successfully returned to her family with all memories of her boyfriend completely erased. Obedience had been achieved through physical obliteration of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no denying Sargant’s lack of medical ethics, and his authoritarianism and reliance on dogma as opposed to clinical evidence, &lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; can present him as almost cartoonishly villainous. With eyes “like washed black pebbles”, “sadomasochistic stubbornness” and a “prodigious enthusiasm for pill popping”, he sweeps the wards like a demented demigod, barking orders to terrified staff and patients alike. This portrayal unhelpfully flattens very real and complicated issues over how best to treat serious mental illness. Patient consent – the bedrock of all good medical practice – cannot always be obtained when a patient’s illness means they lack capacity to make decisions for themselves. Even today, with a modern emphasis on the rights of patients, the responsibilities of clinicians and the need for humanity in psychiatry, enforced treatment is sometimes the only way to prevent a severely unwell psychiatric patient harming or killing themselves. ECT, for example, although used much less frequently than in Sargant’s day (and rightly so), can be a life-saving last resort, as in patients with catatonic depression. With more nuance and less condemnation, Stock could have interrogated more richly the complexities of how best to treat disabling and life-threatening psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Clarke’s most recent book, &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-story-of-a-heart-9780349145594/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Story of a Heart&lt;/a&gt; (Abacus)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has been shortlisted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women’s prize for nonfiction 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQaTNKWFd6dlhjamFwRFZpTWx4ZlVteHV5UnJhdXM2WXBqYkRNN1NOMDNUa040NWFrM1dJSTR1RTdvcVJZRTJHaFU5bmZTUzBlMzZBcEpYakNFVW5mRkcyXzNpZmh0cDd1dmxiZEVGLURjUXhtOXVQVGI4WC02X0tTNUV5WW1OZUhxS2JuUjMtMFZoWGpwR0RJQlpWMDFIQ0t1VnJLSVNuOGliTlVnOFNvTUFVdmRBOUIzdk1ZWGtBZnRNSUdsYTB6YzBGS050T0hVaFRleGpsZm5ET3FPcTlRR0FZeXJQUzQxeUlPNTdaTzdUcUhzbXc</guid></item></channel></rss>
