          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Wyoming are sinking their teeth into a meaty task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 200 people who stayed in a hotel in Grand Teton National Park between May and July may have unknowingly been exposed to rabies, &lt;a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/health/2025-08-12/wyoming-health-department-tracking-down-more-than-200-after-mass-rabies-exposure"&gt;according to Wyoming Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildlife-and-rabies.htm"&gt;an announcement on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the National Park Service reported finding evidence of a bat colony in the attic. The discovery was made after there had been at least eight incidents in which guests encountered winged mammals inside the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Wyoming Health Department is trying to contact all guests who stayed in a block of rooms under the bat's lair. Specifically, they're reaching out to the over 200 who stayed in rooms 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, and 530 at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May 15 and July 27. It was on July 27 that the eighth bat run-in occurred and the hotel closed the eight rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although there were a lot of people exposed in this incident, one positive about it is that we know who 100 percent of those people are," Travis Riddell, director of the Teton County Public Health Department, told Wyoming Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, bats are one of the two main carriers of rabies, the other being skunks. But bats are of particular concern because—unlike an extremely obvious skunk attack—people might not be aware of bat exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inconspicuous risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabies virus generally transmits through saliva via bites and scratches, and bat bites and scratches are easy to miss. The most common bat in Wyoming is the small brown bat, which weighs less than half an ounce on average—though they can look larger due to their wide wings. These teeny bats, with their wee teeth, can leave bites and scratches that are not visible, do not bleed, and are not painful.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed why millions of people struggle to get a good night's sleep—and it's not lumpy pillows or a racing mind, the problem lies in their GUT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, published in medical journal General Psychiatry, researchers explored the link between nodding off and the presence of certain types of bacteria in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study lead Shangyun Shi, from Nanjing Medical University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-a9753600-783b-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that there appears to be a direct link between &lt;span&gt;gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ms Shi used the data from 386,533 people with insomnia and compared it with data taken from two studies into microbiomes—totalling 26,548 people—who had 71 groups of bacteria in common. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded that certain types of bacteria seem to boost or lower the risk of insomnia, and the sleep disorder itself also seems to alter the presence of certain types of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis revealed a total of 14 groups of bacteria were positively associated (1-4 per cent higher odds), and 8 groups negatively associated (1-3 per cent lower odds), with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia was also noted to have an effect on gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was linked to a reduction of 43 per cent to 79 per cent of seven groups of bacteria, and a more than four-fold increase in the abundance of 12 other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Future treatments for insomnia could include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group in particular, the odoribacter class of bacteria which is also linked to was associated with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High levels of odoribacter are linked with good gut help and lower levels of inflammation in the body, while lower levels have been observed in people living with diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Shi said her study further cemented the link between 'the effects of insomnia on gut microbiota, and vice versa', adding that they have a complex two-way relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Future treatments for insomnia could therefore include ways to manage levels of gut bacteria, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Shi noted that the study was not without limitations which needed further exploration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, all the study participants were of European descent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is important to note as the make-up of the microbiome varies among different ethnicities and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as diet and lifestyle weren't accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are known to have an effect the microbiome, and the interplay between genes and the environment, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS estimates that around a third of Britons experience insomnia, with a similar figure in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-7a1a69b0-7855-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-422b7ed0-5085-11e9-ac87-a5c80044591f" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6855797/WHAT-HAPPENS-BODIES-STAY-AWAKE-DAYS-END.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Failing to sleep for days on end can cause an array of symptoms and may even be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within the first 24 hours of sleep deprivation, the body's hormone levels change, leading to a rise in blood pressure, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/05/can-you-die-from-lack-of-sleep.html"&gt;SLATE&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By day two the body is no longer able to break down glucose properly, leading to carbohydrate cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person's body temperature also drops and their immune system becomes compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although no human has ever being reported as dying from insomnia, a 1980s study by the University of Chicago found rats died after 32 days of total sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought the rodents' body temperatures dropped so much they developed hypothermia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their immune systems may also have become so weak that bacteria normally confined to their guts spread throughout their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory is the animals became so stressed they died.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous insomniacs is the music teacher Michael Corke, of New Lenox, Illinois, who suffered from the rare disease fatal familial insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died aged 42 after an alleged six months of total sleep deprivation, however, it cannot be said for sure that insomnia is what killed him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is Randy Gardner who holds the record for the longest time without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1964 while at secondary school in San Diego, the then 17-year-old stayed awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the experiment, Mr Gardner developed speech and memory problems, and began hallucinating, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepio.com/articles/sleep-science/how-long-can-you-go-without-sleep/"&gt;Sleepio&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;          
         &lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the drug delivery system works &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TAR-200 is a miniature, pretzel-shaped drug-device duo containing a chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, which is inserted into the bladder through a catheter. Once inside the bladder, the TAR-200 slowly and consistently releases the gemcitabine into the organ for three weeks per treatment cycle.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Traditionally, gemcitabine has been delivered to the bladder as a liquid solution that only stays in the bladder for a few hours, which had limited effect destroying the cancer, said Daneshmand, who is also a member of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/services/cancer-care/norris-cancer-center/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The theory behind this study was that the longer the medicine sits inside the bladder, the more deeply it would penetrate the bladder and the more cancer it would destroy,” he said. “And it appears that having the chemotherapy released slowly over weeks rather than in just a few hours is a much more effective approach.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient population in the clinical trial &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical trial, known as the SunRISe-1, was conducted at 144 locations globally, including at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/about/keck-hospital-of-usc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keck Hospital of USC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It included 85 patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is the most common form of bladder cancer. The disease is considered high risk when, depending on the type and location of the tumors, the cancer carries a higher chance of recurrence and/or spreading to the bladder muscles or other parts of the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The standard treatment for this type of bladder cancer is an immunotherapy drug, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, which may be ineffective in a percentage of patients. All the patients in the clinical trial had been previously treated with this drug, but their cancer had returned.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The standard treatment plan for these patients &lt;span&gt;was surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissue and organs, which has many health risks and may negatively impact patients’ quality of life,” said Daneshmand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To offer patients a better option, urologic oncologists treated patients with TAR-200 every three weeks for six months, and then four times a year for the next two years. In 70 out of 85 patients, the cancer disappeared and for almost half the patients, was still gone a year later. The treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study also showed that administering TAR-200 along with another immunotherapy drug (cetrelimab) did not prove as effective as TAR-200 on its own and had more side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While participants in the clinical trial will be followed for another year, the study is closed to new participants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of slow-release cancer drugs &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This clinical trial is one of several ongoing ones investigating the effect of TAR-200 and the slow release of cancer-fighting drugs into the bladder to fight cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are at an exciting moment in history,” said Daneshmand, who has been researching this novel treatment since 2016. “Our mission is to deliver cancer-fighting medications into the bladder that will offer lasting remission from cancer, and it looks like we are well on our way toward that goal.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted TAR-200 a New Drug Application Priority Review, which means the FDA plans to take quicker action on the application than other applications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health care corporation Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson manufactures TAR-200.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a bad hare day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rapidly spreading virus is causing cottontail rabbits to grow black, tentacle-like growths out of their heads, prompting warnings to steer clear of the mutated animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The so-called Frankenbunnies have been spotted multiple times in Fort Collins, Colorado. Resident Susan Mansfield &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told 9News&lt;/a&gt; she saw a rabbit with what looked like “black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A viral photo of the “Frankenstein” rabbit that was filmed in Minnesota in 2013.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gunnar Boettcher/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A rapidly-spreading condition called cottontail papilloma virus is causing cottontail rabbits to grow black, tentacle-like protrusions out of their heads, prompting warnings to steer clear of the mutated animals. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t,” she said. “He came back a second year, and it grew.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;One person described the infected critter as having “a scabbiesh-looking growth over their face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The so-called bunny blight is actually a disease called cottontail papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, which causes cottontails to sprout tumors around their head.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is spread by parasites ticks and fleas, which pass on the ailment through their bites, &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/rabbit/conditions/viral/c_rb_shope_papilloma_virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Pet MD.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Typically rabbits become infected in the warmer months of summer when transmitted by being bitten by insects like fleas and ticks,” said Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose, per &lt;a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2025/08/12/frankenstein-rabbits-with-papillomas-sprout-tentacle-like-growths/85628242007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Coloradoan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A bunny with a veritable beard of black growths. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reddit/RecommendationPast54&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the recent sightings occurred in Colorado, the disease most frequently rears its horny head&lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/diseases-of-research-animals-dora/rabbits/rabbit-shope-papilloma-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; in the Midwest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a Minnesota resident caused a stir after posting a video of a tendril-ridden rabbit in his backyard, which he dubbed the “Frankenstein” bunny and &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;compared to the mythical Jackalope&lt;/a&gt; — a hoax that was promulgated by jokesters sewing antlers onto taxidermy rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In light of the rampant CRPV sightings, wildlife experts have warned people not to approach or handle any of the afflicted critters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth,” said Fort Collins, Colorado resident Susan Mansfield while describing one of the infected critters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reddit/Different_Try3353&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, while the virus can spread between rabbits, it is not known to infect humans or pets and is therefore not considered a threat to public health, according to &lt;a href="https://cpw.state.co.us/species/cottontail-rabbits#:~:text=Rabbit%20Papillomas,be%20treated%20by%20a%20veterinarian." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rabbits, on the other hand, are often not so lucky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although cases can resolve on their own, the Medusa-like protrusions can also balloon up to the point that they interfere with the infected carrot cruncher’s ability to eat, causing the creatures to die of starvation, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14993099/Frankenstein-rabbits-tentacles-heads-colorado.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Daily Mail reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In addition, the disease is more severe in domestic bunnies than their wild brethren, with the big fear being that they can develop squamous cell carcinoma — a serious and potentially fatal skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this reason, experts advise keeping pet rabbits away from pets.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If a rabbit does become infected, veterinarians can surgically excise the malevolent dreadlocks before they can become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, CRPV has no known cure. &lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

The study cannot prove the cause, but suggests it could be down to lifestyle factors such an increase in drinking and smoking, or changes in the type or patterns of sleep – all of which can increase the risk of the condition. As a result, they have called the phenomenon “social apnoea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Obviously, people tend to drink more on the weekend. They tend to smoke more on the weekend if they are prone to smoking,” said Prof Danny Eckert, a co-author of the research at Flinders University in Australia, adding that as well as a possible effect from irregular sleep patterns, it might also be that people were less likely to use devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machines to manage the condition at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers say regardless of the underlying cause, the results matter given the health and safety implications of OSA. It is known to &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/obstructive-sleep-apnoea/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raise&lt;/a&gt; the risk of conditions including stroke, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and can also affect driving safety as a result of sleepiness, have an impact on relationships, and reduce quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202505-1184RL" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Eckert and colleagues report how they analysed de-identified data from 70,052 people – the majority of whom were middle-aged, male, and overweight – who used a commercially available under-mattress sleep sensor that can track heart rate, snoring and sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All participants had four or more sleep recordings a week, at least 28 sleep apnoea measurements a year, and five or more breathing disruptions an hour during sleep, on average, a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the odds of moderate to severe sleep apnoea, meaning 15 or more breathing interruptions an hour, were 18% higher on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, and the effect was more pronounced in men and people under the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They also found weekend catch-up sleep of 45 minutes or more, compared with less than six minutes, and social jetlag – in other words, a clock-shift in sleep patterns – of 60 minutes or more, compared with less than 18 minutes, was associated with 47% and 38% greater odds of having moderate to severe OSA respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Sriram Iyer, an NHS respiratory and sleep consultant, who was not involved in the work, said the study highlighted the night-to-night variability in OSA symptoms, and the team’s assumptions about the cause of the weekend uptick were “perfectly reasonable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ryan Chin Taw Cheong, a consultant ENT and sleep surgeon at the Cleveland clinic, London, praised the size of the study, saying it was the first of its kind to look at variability in the severity of the condition throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While he noted that study did not include data on participants’ lifestyles, meaning it could not prove the cause of the increased severity of OSA at the weekends, he said factors such as smoking and drinking were known to exacerbate symptoms, and addressing such issues – alongside diet and weight – should be one of the first steps taken to tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With the best intentions, we can try to treat you medically. But if you’re consuming lots of alcohol or smoking heavily, whatever we’re doing as medical professionals will be just a drop in the ocean,” Cheong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPcHo0UTd1VmhzVkJMOUVNUk5pQWJmRWhlXzJaa2R1WmcwR3JyNlpWMWxVWGhDRW50UkpMWTVIY1dUY3Z2bXM2RGQwUVZnR3ZON0h5d2lPM1ByOEg2NTFwczF1Skp5TGJxWEFyNjgtSUhiOVRXNmY3Z09DcGRndXV6RnZKbkE3b1BzbVlxY0VhVXZMbDRiU29vbGY1SmkyVmxiMUQ4TmpmWWZNb1lnOUE</guid></item><item><title>他的精神病是一个谜--直到医生了解到ChatGPT的健康建议--PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOMWpPX1ZOUVNSemZzZU9hVklJSmpBQVdxU2ZfOW9COE1jUm5veWtCM3VyM3JZdVlMTVB6a1VHUHNsS3BFbHRDb1Q4ekxXa2YzazY1dUJ4M2E5V29UNTlEaG1NaFdTa3FobzFUQmJ4RGlaSHZRQXVINEVUUEdvYzRzOXEycVNPOXBrajdXaV9sTWtFdjFtWW84TlVBV29DOGRldWdFaVFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 60-year-old man arrived at a Seattle hospital convinced his neighbor was poisoning him. Though medically stable at first, he soon developed hallucinations and paranoia. The cause turned out to be bromide toxicity—triggered by a health experiment he began after consulting ChatGPT. The case, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlights a rare but reversible form of psychosis that may have been influenced by generative artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a disconnection from reality. It often involves hallucinations, where people hear, see, or feel things that are not there, or delusions, which are fixed beliefs that persist despite clear evidence to the contrary. People experiencing psychosis may have difficulty distinguishing between real and imagined experiences, and may behave in ways that seem irrational or confusing to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosis is not a diagnosis in itself, but a symptom that can appear in a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. It can also be triggered by brain injuries, infections, or toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man’s initial presentation was unusual but not dramatic. He came to the emergency department reporting that his neighbor was trying to poison him. His vital signs and physical examination were mostly normal. Routine laboratory tests, however, revealed some striking abnormalities: extremely high chloride levels, a highly negative anion gap, and severe phosphate deficiency. Despite this, he denied using any medications or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As doctors searched for answers, his mental state worsened. Within a day, he was hallucinating and behaving erratically. He had to be placed on a psychiatric hold and was started on risperidone to manage his symptoms. But a deeper look at his bloodwork suggested a rare toxic condition: bromism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromism occurs when bromide—a chemical similar to chloride—builds up in the body to toxic levels. Historically, bromide was used in sedatives and other medications, but it was phased out in the United States by the late 1980s. It is still used in some industrial and cleaning applications. In cases of bromism, bromide can interfere with chloride tests and cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms ranging from confusion to full-blown psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man’s doctors consulted with Poison Control and eventually confirmed that bromism was the likely cause of his symptoms. After being stabilized with fluids and nutritional support, the man revealed a key detail: for the past three months, he had been replacing regular table salt with sodium bromide. His motivation was nutritional—he wanted to eliminate chloride from his diet, based on what he believed were harmful effects of sodium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief was strengthened, he explained, by information he had received from ChatGPT. While experimenting with ways to improve his health, he asked the chatbot whether chloride could be replaced. The model reportedly offered bromide as an alternative, without flagging any health risks or asking why the substitution was being considered. Encouraged by what he interpreted as scientific endorsement, he purchased sodium bromide online and began consuming it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests confirmed that his blood bromide level had reached 1700 mg/L—well above the normal range of 0.9 to 7.3 mg/L. After stopping the supplement and receiving supportive treatment, his psychiatric symptoms gradually subsided. He was weaned off risperidone before discharge and remained stable in follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual incident carries several caveats. A single case report cannot establish causation. There may have been multiple factors contributing to the man’s psychosis, and his exact interaction with ChatGPT remains unverified. The medical team does not have access to the chatbot conversation logs and cannot confirm the exact wording or sequence of messages that led to the decision to consume bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case reports, by nature, describe only one patient’s experience. They are not designed to test hypotheses or rule out alternative explanations. In some cases, rare outcomes may simply be coincidental or misunderstood. Without controlled studies or broader surveillance, it is difficult to know how common—or uncommon—such incidents truly are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their limitations, case reports often serve as early warning signs in medicine. They tend to highlight novel presentations, unexpected side effects, or emerging risks that are not yet widely recognized. Many medical breakthroughs and safety reforms have started with a single unusual case. In this instance, the authors argue that the use of AI-powered chatbots should be considered when evaluating unusual psychiatric presentations, especially when patients are known to seek health advice online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case also raises broader concerns about the growing role of generative AI in personal health decisions. Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained to provide fluent, human-like responses. But they do not understand context, cannot assess user intent, and are not equipped to evaluate medical risk. In this case, the bot may have listed bromide as a chemical analogue to chloride without realizing that a user might interpret that information as a dietary recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/chatgpt-psychosis-this-scientist-predicted-ai-induced-delusions-two-years-later-it-appears-he-was-right/" target="_blank"&gt;chatbots could contribute to psychosis&lt;/a&gt; once seemed speculative. But recent editorials and anecdotal reports suggest that this may be a real, if rare, phenomenon—especially among individuals with underlying vulnerability. Danish psychiatrist Søren Dinesen Østergaard was among the first to raise the alarm. In 2023, he published a warning in Schizophrenia Bulletin, suggesting that the cognitive dissonance of interacting with a seemingly intelligent but ultimately mechanical system could destabilize users who already struggle with reality-testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, multiple stories have emerged of individuals who experienced dramatic changes in thinking and behavior after prolonged chatbot use. Some became convinced that they had divine missions, while others believed they were communicating with sentient beings. In one reported case, a man believed he had been chosen by ChatGPT to “break” a simulated reality. In another, a user’s romantic partner came to believe that the chatbot was a spiritual guide and began withdrawing from human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories tend to follow a pattern: intense engagement with the chatbot, increasingly eccentric beliefs, and a lack of pushback from the system itself. Critics point out that language models are trained to reward user satisfaction, which can mean agreeing with or amplifying the user’s worldview—even when it is distorted or delusional. That dynamic may mimic what psychiatrists call confirmation bias, a known contributor to psychotic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some developers are exploring ways to detect when a conversation appears to touch on delusional thinking—such as references to secret messages or supernatural identity—and redirect users to professional help. But such systems are still in their infancy, and the commercial incentives for chatbot companies tend to prioritize engagement over safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case of the Seattle man is a sobering reminder of how even a seemingly minor substitution—replacing salt with a chemical cousin—can spiral into a medical and psychiatric emergency when guided by decontextualized information. While AI chatbots have potential to support healthcare in structured settings, this report suggests they may also present hidden risks, especially for users who take their advice literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;A Case of Bromism Influenced by Use of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Audrey Eichenberger, Stephen Thielke, and Adam Van Buskirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:06:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOMWpPX1ZOUVNSemZzZU9hVklJSmpBQVdxU2ZfOW9COE1jUm5veWtCM3VyM3JZdVlMTVB6a1VHUHNsS3BFbHRDb1Q4ekxXa2YzazY1dUJ4M2E5V29UNTlEaG1NaFdTa3FobzFUQmJ4RGlaSHZRQXVINEVUUEdvYzRzOXEycVNPOXBrajdXaV9sTWtFdjFtWW84TlVBV29DOGRldWdFaVFn</guid></item><item><title>什么是肌酸？健身兄弟补充剂突然无处不在-有线</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE91ejZMd1pqN3g5SDJkWktNVTJVN3NNMlNyWXlkaXh6TGNSSUlROG42Q0ZYeWtQZWlGcnFPLXU3NVY1c0plZkhKbU9WdFFhMnRheDNEMnllVFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;First, it was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-mushroom-supplements/" target="_blank"&gt;mushrooms in your coffee&lt;/a&gt;.

Now we know that’s not true, and naturally there’s some interest in creatine for that reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; creatine? Here's everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="TableOfContentWrapper-jDOHAN fhKwHR table-of-content"&gt;&lt;div data="[object Object]" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT bgMFty"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;p class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM diANax"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw cSYOvq" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="creatine-explained" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Creatine, Explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine is a compound your body produces in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas, according to Federica Amati, a medical scientist and registered public health nutritionist. Most of it ends up in your skeletal muscles, where it’s stored as phosphocreatine and used to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that powers muscle contractions, nerve signals, and protein synthesis for tissue repair. The rest—&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass"}' href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/creatine-supplements-can-help-build-muscle-mass" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt;—is found in brain tissue and the testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;You make about a gram of creatine a day from three amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine. You also get more from animal-based foods like red meat, fish, and poultry. For most healthy people, that’s enough. So, creatine supplements aren’t essential for general health, but they can boost performance and recovery under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="how-creatine-works-in-the-body" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;How Creatine Works in the Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit"&gt;Photo by Steve Mitchell/EMPICS via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;ATP is your cells’ main energy source. High-intensity exercise drains it fast, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553175/"&gt;breaking ATP down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine phosphate donates a phosphate group to ADP, recycling it back into ATP almost immediately. The more phosphocreatine stored in your muscles, the faster you can regenerate ATP and the more power you can produce in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="muscle-growth-and-exercise-performance" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Muscle Growth and Exercise Performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine is most useful for activities that demand short, intense effort: sprinting, weightlifting, and high-intensity interval training, to name a few. It’s far less relevant for endurance sports like marathons. Some evidence suggests creatine also increases muscle glycogen storage, which could help with recovery and energy replenishment between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine doesn’t directly build muscle, but paired with resistance training and adequate nutrition, it can help preserve muscle strength and lean body mass. It’s particularly important if you’re recovering from an injury, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/" target="_blank"&gt;as you age&lt;/a&gt;, when sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) becomes a risk, as it activates specialized stem cells known as satellite cells. Zimmerman points out that women, especially in perimenopause and menopause, may see health benefits. “As women get older—starting in our forties—we lose body mass 1 to 2 percent a year, and that can affect bone health later on in life,” says Zimmermann. “Creatine [supplements] support keeping and building lean muscle mass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Zimmermann adds, “Women tend to have lower muscle mass than men, just naturally, so I think women may actually respond better to supplementation, because they’re at baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="creatine-and-brain-health" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Creatine and Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic performance are well-documented, its effects on mental performance are still emerging. Early findings are promising. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may reduce mental fatigue, especially during high-stress situations, such as sleep deprivation or exhaustive exercise. It may also improve certain aspects of memory, particularly in groups with lower baseline creatine levels, such as vegetarians and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some preliminary research even suggests it could help with symptoms of depression by supporting brain energy and boosting the production of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. That’s particularly relevant for women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, says Zimmerman. “Estrogen shifts affect brain health, our mood, brain fog, and being able to think clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="the-best-form-of-creatine" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Best Form of Creatine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nowadays, step into any GNC and you’ll find several forms of creatine: creatine hydrochloride, magnesium creatine chelate, creatine citrate, creatine nitrate, creatine ethyl ester, and buffered creatine. But creatine monohydrate is the most studied, the most effective, and usually the cheapest, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. No other form has shown any additional benefits, confirms Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Creatine monohydrate is typically sold as a flavorless, white powder that you can mix into water or a shake. The standard dose is three to five grams per day, says Amati. Some athletes may “load” with higher doses, but studies show this offers no long-term benefits and can put unnecessary stress on the kidneys, says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="is-creatine-safe" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Is Creatine Safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For most healthy adults, creatine is a safe and well-tolerated supplement for months or even years of use. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found no significant health risks. The main side effects are minor: weight gain from temporary water retention in the first week of supplementation, bloating, and mild gastric discomfort, usually from oversize doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="testing" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT bgMFty"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Meet the Experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="paywall"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/v2/offers/wir_generic_ctrl?source=Site_0_HCL_WIR_EDIT_HARDCODED_0_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE_ZZ" target="_blank"&gt;Power up with unlimited access to WIRED&lt;/a&gt;.

That’s why when my editor challenged me to eat a serving of almonds every single day for a week, I was really looking forward (and a little nervous) to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Over the week, I kept close tabs on how I was feeling, looking, and eating. Turns out, there’s more to these crunchy little bites than meets the eye.&lt;br data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When my editor asked me to commit to eating a serving of almonds daily for a week, I was all in, but I won’t pretend it felt second nature right away. If I am being completely honest, as much as I advocate for nuts as a healthy snack, consistency is not always my strong suit. With this challenge, though, I paid careful attention to the changes, big and small, that came from actually doing what I recommend to my clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Incorporating almonds into my routine felt a little clunky at first. There were days I forgot until late afternoon, and other times I just grabbed a handful alongside whatever else I was eating. Some days they were a mid-morning snack, other times I tossed them into salads or added them to oatmeal. The main goal was just to get them in, not to stress about timing or presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="8" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happened to my body when I ate almonds every day" data-anchor-id="what-happened-to-my-body-when-i-ate-almonds-every-day" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;What happened to my body when I ate almonds every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One of the first things I noticed by midweek was a genuine change in how full I felt throughout my day. Normally, I’m a bit of an opportunistic snacker, meaning I’ll grab whatever’s nearby, especially when the afternoon slump hits. With daily almonds, I found myself far less likely to go hunting for a bag of chips or an energy bar. Even a single serving (around 23 almonds) helped keep hunger pangs at bay, which surprised me with how much steadier my energy felt between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I didn’t experience a dramatic difference in my skin, despite the promising data on almond consumption and its link to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduced wrinkles and facial pigment intensity" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0"&gt;reduced wrinkles and facial pigment intensity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect these kinds of changes would require a longer-term commitment; a week simply may not be long enough to turn over a new leaf when it comes to your complexion. That said, I do believe the nutrients in almonds are doing beneficial work beneath the surface. I just can’t see the fruits of my labor yet! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Digestively, almonds didn’t cause me any issues, but the fiber content certainly helped keep things regular. If you’re not used to eating high-fiber foods, a sudden jump in almond intake could potentially leave you feeling a bit bloated or gassy, but for me, it was only a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What stood out the most, however, was the shift in my snacking behavior and my perception of fullness. Eating almonds daily made it easier to pass on less nutritious snacks. This wasn’t about strict self-discipline but more about not needing to battle cravings in the first place. They simply didn’t come on as strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;From a practical standpoint, almonds proved incredibly convenient. I didn’t need special preparation, refrigeration, or a plan to fit them into my days. This was key for me sticking to my goal of eating almonds every day, since my days can get a bit chaotic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The bottom line for my week-long experiment? While big, outward changes (like glowing skin) didn’t materialize in just seven days, the more subtle shifts in my appetite, digestion, and overall food choices were clear. It reminded me that sometimes the best nutrition habits are the ones that feel almost effortless once you start. Eating almonds every day nudged my body and mind toward healthier decisions without feeling like a chore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="health-benefits-of-eating-almonds" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-jpjoxu emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Health benefits of eating almonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s no surprise that almonds are a nutritional powerhouse. Packed with healthy fats, plant-based protein, and essential nutrients, they’ve earned their spot as a favorite among health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Rich in nutrients &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346393/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346393/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Just one ounce of almonds" data-node-id="18.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.0.0"&gt;Just one ounce of almonds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contains around 6 grams of protein, 14 grams of fat (primarily heart-healthy monounsaturated fats), and 3.5 grams of fiber. It packs a variety of vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin E (37% of the daily recommended intake) and magnesium (19% of the daily recommended intake).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant" data-node-id="19.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="19.0.0"&gt;Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in protecting your cells from oxidative damage.

Almonds are little nutrient superstars that pack a punch in the vitamin and mineral department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Supports heart health &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One of the most well-documented benefits of almonds is their impact on cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that routine almond consumption can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412597/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412597/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="help lower LDL cholesterol" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;help lower LDL cholesterol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels, also known as “bad” cholesterol, while &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38931317/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38931317/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="increasing HDL or “good” cholesterol" data-node-id="21.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.3.0"&gt;increasing HDL or “good” cholesterol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Almonds are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high in healthy fats and dietary fiber" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;high in healthy fats and dietary fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are two factors that help promote longer-lasting fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Interestingly, research suggests that almonds may also slightly support metabolism, helping your &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201139/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34201139/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body burn calories more efficiently" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="24.1.0"&gt;body burn calories more efficiently&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you’re sticking to the recommended serving size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="body-h3 css-1rd019x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;May benefit skin and hair health &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Are almonds the real-life equivalent of the fountain of youth? Not quite. But, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673587/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="some data suggest" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;some data suggest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that regular almond consumption might improve skin elasticity and reduce signs of aging over time. Results may vary depending on individual factors like genetics and duration of intake (like in my case—womp womp). The study was also conducted on postmenopausal women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="body-h3 css-1rd019x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;Helps manage blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Almonds’ combination of protein, fat, and fiber makes them a fantastic snack option, especially for people looking to stabilize blood sugar levels. The nutrients in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166637/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="almonds slow down digestion" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;almonds slow down digestion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, potentially preventing spikes in blood sugar after meals. Magnesium further supports this effect by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9379913/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9379913/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="aiding in insulin regulation" data-node-id="28.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;aiding in insulin regulation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="the-bottom-line" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-jpjoxu emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="the-bottom-line" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After my week of eating almonds every day, I can confidently say that incorporating them into your diet is a simple, sustainable way to support overall nutrition. While I didn’t notice my skin turning into a radiant, glowing masterpiece worthy of its own Instagram filter (which I was SO hoping to see!), I did feel fuller, more satisfied, and less inclined to snack on junk food. And at the risk of giving TMI, I was very regular that week too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Would I recommend this? Absolutely. Whether you’re looking to improve satiety, support your heart, or just add more vitamins and minerals to your routine, almonds are worth the small effort it takes to include them. My biggest tip is to get creative! Add sliced almonds to your salad, mix them into oatmeal, or blend them into smoothies (really!!). And if you have a sweet tooth, try enjoying them dipped in chocolate. With so many easy ways to enjoy almonds, this is one healthy habit you’ll actually want to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:31:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNUjBhQVFLNk8wdFJuS1djN3JWeGtaVDV2dWVFSXgzY2pud3d2aHNpdGNHdlNzUF8xbjRaTjF6TnFrYUVxWjREdFczZHd6dlJjVExMdlp4NVVldHBscV9yanl3Q29TXzRGcEg0YWFuX2JKSUVVMGxydDZ2TGNycVE3U0tqRDh2UDdYYVE5YmUzajUtSTVaQkJPbG1CbnNXdFVoODZ2b2tfdVhxMFBUbHBQYg</guid></item><item><title>蠕虫侵入男人的眼球，导致医生吸出他的眼部果冻- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSm4xNWF2bU4xNHhaVDZzLXJHN0owNTNBeDZkNGZIR2tqY1JMR0llZGNZOUNlVjBzMThoWUFUZnYtcWVVNHFSMzJfN1BQWVp3RmlRVHA2TXNsMFJLNHpCVkltTmJTSmlQTE9xYl9KZzZ1clluT0RFSFFRUTRVQXl0UDF2SkRZSXRfaDRPbFVuUVdBRjhrN0VrZDVjc0kwWHE3MVRMY0g5bmc1V0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;For eight months, a 35-year-old man in India was bothered by his left eye. It was red and blurry. When he finally visited an ophthalmology clinic, it didn't take long for doctors to unearth the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2502742"&gt;a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors report that they first noted that the eye was bloodshot and inflamed, and the pupil was dilated and fixed. The man's vision in the eye was 20/80. A quick look inside his eye revealed it was all due to a small worm, which they watched "moving sluggishly" in the back of his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gouge out the parasitic pillager, the doctors performed a pars plana vitrectomy—a procedure that involves sucking out some of the jelly-like vitreous inside the eye. This procedure can be used in the treatment of a variety of eye conditions, but using it to hoover up worms is rare. In order to get in, the doctors make tiny incisions in the white parts of the eye (the sclera) and use a hollow needle-like device with suction. They replace extracted eye jelly with things like saline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the device was able to suck in part of the worm's tail and drag it out—still squirming. Under the microscope, they quickly identified the peeper creeper. With a bulbous head, well-formed intestines, and a thick outer layer, it perfectly fit the description of &lt;em&gt;Gnathostoma spinigerum&lt;/em&gt;, a known bodily marauder that can sometimes wiggle its way into eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. spinigerum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are endemic parasites in India that infect carnivorous mammals, particularly wild and domestic cats and dogs. In these primary hosts, adult worms form tumor-like masses on the walls of the animals' intestinal tracts. There, the adults mate, and the mass erupts like an infernal, infectious volcano, spewing out eggs. The eggs are passed in the animals' feces and can then spread to intermediate hosts. These include freshwater plankton, which get eaten by fish and amphibians, which then get eaten by the cats and dogs to complete the cycle. The young parasites can also be taken up by dead-end hosts like birds, including chickens, and snakes—these are called paratenic hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

Mozaffarian said, “Unless protein intake is very low for a long time, there are few symptoms. If it’s very low and prolonged, then people can experience fatigue, hair loss, muscle loss, skin and nail changes, ankle swelling and brain fog.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trommelen noted a syndrome known as kwashiorkor, a severe form of malnutrition caused by protein deficiency that can stunt growth, is unlikely to occur in the Western world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, if you’re experiencing any of these symptoms or are concerned about your protein intake, it’s a good idea to consult with your health care provider, especially if you’re undereating or taking weight-loss medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Chicken Breast Could Be Enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Protein should account for 10% to 35% of your calories, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/protein-and-heart-health#:~:text=How%20much%20protein%20do%20you,daily%20calories%20come%20from%20protein." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/protein-and-heart-health#:~:text=How%20much%20protein%20do%20you,daily%20calories%20come%20from%20protein." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. On a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, that’s 200 to 700 calories from protein, or 50 to 175 grams. The Department of Agriculture has a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="calculator of dietary reference intakes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;calculator of dietary reference intakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to help you determine how much protein you need. The recommended dietary allowance is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. That means a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds and who doesn’t exercise would need 53 grams of protein a day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As examples, 7 ounces of cooked chicken breast contains roughly 50 grams of protein, and so does 5.5 ounces of Greek yogurt eaten with 3 ounces of chicken breast. The American Heart Association says that most people, even athletes, can get enough protein by eating a serving of dairy for each of three meals in a day, plus a piece of meat the size of a deck of cards at lunch and supper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you get older, protein needs may increase, experts said. “Older adults slowly lose muscle mass, and there’s data suggesting it’s perhaps partially because they are less efficient at using dietary protein,” Trommelen noted. “It’s been suggested that older adults should consume up to 1.2 grams per kilogram of weight per day, up from the general recommendation of 0.36 grams, although this is still a topic of debate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have You Considered The Rest Of Your Diet? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may also want to consider what other nutrients might help your body do its best.

For adolescent and premenopausal females, iron is also a shortfall nutrient. Nutritionists are especially concerned about four nutrients — fiber, calcium, vitamin D and potassium. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Avoid Protein-Related Visceral Fat, Try Strength Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of us aren’t engaging in lifestyles that will help us absorb protein in the most efficient way possible. If you want more muscle growth, you’ll need extra strength training, not extra protein. Mozaffarian said that you’ve got to be working out on the regular for protein to be able to make a difference. “Eating more protein is valuable when people are engaged in a regular program of strength training and when they’re working out several times per week, where it helps build muscle mass and strength.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trommelen agreed, saying: “Physical activity, especially resistance exercise, greatly enhances the body’s use of dietary protein.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also true that since the body can’t store protein, amounts that are more than your body needs end up being used for energy or stored as fat. “Without a regular program of strength training, eating more protein has little health value,” Mozaffarian said. “Just eating more protein alone won’t build muscle. In fact, excess dietary protein is converted to visceral fat, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. That’s because when protein intake is high, insulin rises, just like it does with starch or sugar intakes.

Avoid soda, candy, processed meat and ultraprocessed foods high in starch, sugar or salt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Focus on the food source and its overall impact on your health, rather than the grams of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Avoid processed meats, ultraprocessed foods like protein bars and protein powders. Protein-rich foods with evidence for general health benefits include fish, shellfish, yogurt, cheese and milk. Legumes, grains and nuts also provide protein and substantial health benefits. Unprocessed red meats are OK in moderation, up to two servings per week.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head For The Produce Aisle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It’s presence, not just sightseeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits? Any downsides?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to opt for this slow, immersive approach to travel and everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I love about it is how grounded it feels,” Susag said. “You end up discovering hole-in-the-wall bakeries, chatting with locals or stumbling into a park you never would’ve planned for. It brings back that sense of wonder that sometimes gets lost in overplanned trips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes believes &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-slow-travel-vacation_l_63ea5c31e4b0063ccb27b668" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="slow travel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68913585e4b0ea04dda05538" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63ea5c31e4b0063ccb27b668" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;slow travel&lt;/a&gt; trends like land snorkeling are better for the planet and for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s jumping on a scenic train, joining a walking tour with a local guide, or staying in a homestay that gives back to the community ― you get more out of your travels when you go deeper, not faster,” he said. “It helps ease burnout, brings you back to the moment, and supports the people and places you visit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that slowing down helps you reconnect with yourself, others and the earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only downside is that it’s not always the most time-efficient way to see a city, especially if you’re on a tight schedule,” Susag noted. “But if you’ve got a few days and want to feel a place rather than just visit it, it’s amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way to try out land snorkeling on your next trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold on the idea of land snorkeling but don’t know where to begin? Just start simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you arrive somewhere new, walk instead of jumping in a car,” Barnes advised. “Ditch the big bucket-list blitz and choose a few experiences that really matter. And give yourself permission to wander ― without a plan, without your phone, and without rushing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that you can even start with a small group tour and let a guide handle the logistics of your day so that you can stay present and curious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to give land snorkeling a try, pick a neighborhood, leave your phone in your pocket and just start walking,” Susag said. “Walk with no real goal, chat with locals, follow your curiosity and don’t be afraid to take a few wrong turns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to commit to a full land-snorkeling vacation, either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The trial of new food items often accounts for hilarious moments. This viral clip captures the same in the cutest way. The video shows a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy trying a strawberry for the first time. However, trying to eat the fruit ends up becoming a playful struggle for the little one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever puppy’s first time eating strawberry makes for adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a user, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bhootu_the_samoyed/?e=f2942643-37b3-403a-8118-951f37f20834&amp;amp;g=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:@bhootu_the_samoyed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;@bhootu_the_samoyed&lt;/a&gt;, took to Instagram to share an adorable post about their dog named Chomchom. The profile is dedicated to the pup’s endless adventures with his &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/samoyed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samoyed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samoyed&lt;/a&gt; brother, Bhootu. In the Instagram Reel, the Golden tries out a strawberry for the very first time. However, the furbaby realizes that eating the fruit isn’t an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video begins with the Golden Retriever puppy asking if fans want to see how he ate his first strawberry. His owner delivers the fruit on the floor to make it easier for the puppy to explore it. The furball tries to eat it, finding it extremely delicious. However, Chomchom struggles to get the strawberry in his mouth. It keeps slipping away whenever he tries to grab it. This leaves the canine frustrated and restless, but he refuses to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He uses his paws and mouth to grab the fruit. Since Chomchom is a puppy, it is natural for him to find it a little difficult to grab a new food item. After multiple attempts, the Golden succeeds in getting the strawberry as he swiftly taps his paw on it. In a similar vein, there was a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/178167-dog-golden-retriever-new-treat-egg-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of another pup having no idea how to eat a boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chomchom’s adorable struggle with his new treat will surely melt one’s heart. The newly uploaded Instagram Reel has gained over 14K likes and 172K views at the time of writing. Netizens couldn’t help but gush over the Golden’s cuteness in the comments section, with one stating, “Aww preety little baby.” Another wrote, “Oookk stawpppp you don’t need to be this cuteeeee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/186325-owner-shares-cute-video-golden-retriever-puppy-eating-strawberry-first-time" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Owner Shares Cute Video of Golden Retriever Puppy Eating Strawberry for First Time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Owner Shares Cute Video of Golden Retriever Puppy Eating Strawberry for First Time&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 10:54:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZWUhhNkk2MFpyRmdRZzVkYkZxQnZqSnpIVHNrLS1Idm5GbGdxOGU0M0t1c0g4TzlieDRuUm9SMnJpeUQ2T3dTTWZ4NGp6elMxZ2pCS051RnZSQ0NaOTlEMXkwQ29HaURWTkZXd3RRRGRNcTQ</guid></item><item><title>墨西哥湾沿岸食肉细菌激增的原因是什么？ - NOLA.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="1"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Coast has seen a rise in infections caused by Vibrio vulnificus, a deadly pathogen found in warm saltwater and raw shellfish known for its ability to rapidly infect and destroy skin and tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the bacteria has been linked to over 70 infections and nine deaths across Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas. Louisiana accounts for a disproportionate share of the cases, with 20 infections and four deaths. In comparison, the state averaged just seven cases and one death per year over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Experts point to several factors fueling the recent increase, including rising water temperatures and storm runoff that provides nutrients for bacterial growth. While the bacterium can sometimes enter the body through eating raw or undercooked seafood, the Louisiana Department of Health reports that three-quarters of recent infections involved wounds or other direct water exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ideal conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm, brackish waters — conditions that are common during the summer months. After heavy rains and storms, nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen wash into coastal waters, helping the bacteria multiply, said Tiong Aw, a public health microbiologist and professor at Tulane University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"All these create an ideal condition for Vibrio to grow and survive," Aw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are dozens of types of Vibrio bacteria, and they can live in temperatures as low as 50 degrees. But they especially like the warm conditions of the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/36/8/JCLI-D-22-0409.1.xml" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Climate found that water temperatures in the Gulf have risen at twice the rate of global ocean temperatures between 1970 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the oceans have gotten warmer in recent years, it’s not surprising that cases are increasing,” said Dr. David Mushatt, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University. “Temperature and salt content are what these bacteria like.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;h3&gt;A dangerous infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus enters the body either through an open wound exposed to contaminated water or by consuming raw shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating raw or undercooked contaminated oysters causes gastrointestinal illness and, in severe cases, a bloodstream infection. That form is not a skin-destroying infection, but it can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection can also occur when Vibrio vulnificus gains access through a break in the skin. Someone shucking raw oysters with a cut, for example, can be exposed if the bacteria invade the wound. It can also enter through injuries sustained in or near the water, such as scraping a leg on a boat, or from any existing wound that comes into contact with contaminated seawater.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, it multiplies rapidly and releases toxins that kill cells and break down tissue, causing severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a "rare but very serious infection," said Dr. Norman Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida. Most cuts exposed to seawater will heal normally, he said, but certain warning signs can signal the infection has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hallmark sign is the appearance of blisters, known as bullae, near the infected wound, and a rapid onset of swelling and redness, Beatty said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Often, a delay in getting to a doctor who could prescribe antibiotics allows the infection to progress, sometimes requiring surgical removal of infected tissue or even amputation, said Beatty. Severe cases can lead to sepsis and septic shock, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a cut while in the water, Mushatt suggested cleaning it right away with hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic ointment. But don’t wait if the wound starts turning red, swelling or oozing pus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can progress over hours,” Mushatt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting off going to the emergency room until your vacation is over is not the right choice. Even a three-hour drive back home from the beach could make a difference in the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t want to wait that long,” said Mushatt, who recommended seeking care at a local ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with liver disease, diabetes or weakened immune systems should be especially cautious. “For these individuals, the threshold to seek care is even lower,” Dr. Mushatt added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small number linked to raw oysters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of recent infections have been linked to eating raw oysters, according to LDH, and no single harvesting area has been identified as a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Watts, a seafood extension specialist at LSU AgCenter, emphasized that eating raw shellfish always carries some risk, especially from April through October when the bacteria is most active. She advised consumers to look for oysters labeled safe for raw consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Certain groups, including pregnant people, older adults, those with weakened immune systems, and individuals with liver disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or undergoing chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive treatments, should avoid raw shellfish altogether to reduce their risk of serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no specific state or federal program testing coastal waters for Vibrio vulnificus, said Aw. However, Aw’s lab has been monitoring Lake Pontchartrain for the last year and found the bacteria present year-round, with higher levels during summer when water temperatures reach about 86 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 75 to 85 percent of Americans experience back pain at some point during their lifetimes, while 25million currently suffer from lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors normally treat the pain, which can be caused by sprains, arthritis and traumatic injuries, with over-the-counter painkillers, physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients have also been offered talk therapy since 2017, with doctors referring some patients for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With CBT, patients attempt to reconceptualize their pain in order to reduce it. Pain reductions from this tend to be short-lived, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, scientists recruited patients who had been suffering from moderate back pain who said it limited their day-to-day activities, such as causing them to move slowly or struggle to pick up heavy objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were 47 years old on average, overweight and said they had been seeking care for the pain for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were asked to attend 20 clinics in Perth and Sydney, Australia, to receive treatment between October 2018 and August 2020 and split into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first received CFT, the second received CFT plus biofeedback, where sensors are used to map movements, and the third received typical care, or followed the care plan recommended by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in both CFT groups attended seven treatment sessions over three months and a booster session at six months. Each session lasted 60 minutes and was led by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of adults aged 18 and over with any form of pain. Back pain is the most common form of pain in the US, the figures suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the CFT sessions, participants were first encouraged to share the story of their pain to help them understand their discomfort and its underlying causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then guided through movements and activities that they previously said were painful, feared or avoided, to help them learn how to manage the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the sessions, patients also received lifestyle guidance on healthy habits such as the need for regular physical activity, improved sleep, diet and regular socializing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the initial study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00441-5/abstract"&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/a&gt;, all participants had a moderate level of disability from back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years later, however, in the groups that received CFT this had dropped to and remained at a mild level of disability, when back pain causes some limitations but does not impair overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with mild impairment may be able to walk around with little difficulty but can still struggle to lift heavy objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant difference between the groups that received CFT only and those that received CFT and biofeedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the group continuing typical care, however, people still experienced a moderate level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Participants who received CFT still reported significant improvements in pain three years later (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A moderate level of disability suggests participants can move only a short distance before requiring a break and can still perform basic daily activities like dressing or cooking but may take longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was first revealed in 2023 but was republished again this month with updated data from three years after the study began, showing that the therapy could reduce pain for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists said CFT boosted participants' movement and reduced their pain because it reduced their fear of certain actions that had caused pain and made them less likely to avoid these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the course was also carried out by trained therapists and had a booster session six months later, which ensured patients got better training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest paper, the researchers said: 'CFT produces clinically important effects for activity limitation at three-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These long-term effects are novel and provide the opportunity to markedly reduce the effect of chronic back pain if the intervention can be widely implemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:58:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>靶向单一激素可以帮助治疗40%的IBS-D病例- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPMTRhQk5mQTR3ZXdON01obVVQOHBpRnRmanVTcFZPX2FWZjQ1cTFZRmFxUzRqZmhWb1ZIVmlmaS1MaEZMN1FHTGlqeHNScWZ4ZW8xV3FiM1EzUHl5Vm9UM3JuTWE3aUlBcjktTmVLTjNuVkF0cjVsQkx3N0NadzN0MllLSTVzUHdJNzVmcmF2QUY4WnV2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is an unpleasant condition to live with, affecting &lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/"&gt;millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Now a new study has identified what could be a key trigger for the condition – a trigger which could be targeted by future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation on 108 people with and without IBS-D and related conditions has revealed a hormone called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSL5"&gt;insulin-like peptide 5&lt;/a&gt; (INSL5) is released when bile acids that aid digestion find themselves further along the digestive tract than usual, in the large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shouldn't happen, but when it does – due to certain conditions and gut malfunctions – more INSL5 gets produced, which causes diarrhea-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is potentially responsible for around two out of every five cases of IBS-D, the researchers say, and may explain why a lot of existing drugs and strategies to combat IBS-D are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-nocebo-effect-shows-gluten-may-not-be-the-problem-in-ibs"&gt;Surprising 'Nocebo Effect' Shows Gluten May Not Be The Problem in IBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you go to the doctor with chronic diarrhea, they'll likely test for food intolerances, rule out an infection or look for signs of inflammation," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Chris Bannon, an endocrinologist at the University of Cambridge in the UK. "There has been significant research interest in the microbiome, but gut hormones have been neglected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's becoming increasingly clear that gut hormones play an important role in things like gut health and weight management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170814" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170814" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart.jpg" alt="INSL5 levels chart" class="wp-image-170814 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart-600x269.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170814" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found bile acids (TCA) led to elevated ISNL5 levels and diarrhea. (Bannon et al., &lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included participants with &lt;a href="https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet/bile-acid-diarrhoea"&gt;bile acid diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; (BAD) as well as IBS-D, helping the researchers identify a link between these conditions, the differences between them, and the triggers responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, BAD is difficult to diagnose and is often classed as IBS, and the researchers hope that being better able to spot it will lead to treatments that can more effectively target the underlying causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that INSL5 is naturally produced by the body. Although it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;brings on diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;, it's actually a sign of the body trying to protect itself: it detects that bile acids shouldn't be in the colon, and flushes them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes sense that you would have something that detects toxins and helps the body rid itself of them," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bannon. "But a problem develops if it's always being triggered by bile acid, causing very dramatic symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies using mouse models &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-022-03635-8"&gt;had found&lt;/a&gt; that INSL5 could cause diarrhea, but this is the first time researchers have been able to show the same processes in people, and in ways that are connected to two recognized conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps are to look at potential treatments targeting INSL5. Some IBS-D patients in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/apt.17426"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; showed improved symptoms when given the anti-sickness medicine ondansetron – a known INSL5 blocker – which may indicate one route forward, although it's not yet clear why ondansetron works so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a very exciting finding because it showed us that this hormone could be playing a big part in symptoms of this misunderstood condition," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bannon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also meant it might allow us to develop a blood test to help diagnose bile acid diarrhea if INSL5 levels are only high in these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335393"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lifelong boat captain George Billiris says he's lucky to be alive after &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-vibrio-vulnificus-cases-2025-deaths-decline-danger-remains/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria that lurks in warm coastal waters like those along Florida's Gulf Coast, nearly killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started to get chills, feverish, my leg was swelling, burning," the third-generation sponge fisherman told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billiris was wading in the water while fishing with his grandson back in July 2019 when he contracted the bacteria, which got into his system through a cut he had on his back leg. It was "just a little tiny scab," Billiris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, doctors used a marker on his leg to track the spread of the bacteria. After three weeks of treatment, the infection subsided, saving his leg from amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-how-to-protect-yourself-expert/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;one in five people who contract the bacteria die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after rapid spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-names-list-2025-season/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the danger of contracting Vibrio vulnificus heightens, according to Dr. Valerie Harwood, a microbiologist at the University of South Florida.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Research also shows the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ocean-temperatures-higher-models-predicted-climate-experts-warn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ocean's water temperature is rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due to climate change, which leads to more frequent and severe storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harwood said that because the bacteria thrives in warmer waters, it means more infections are seen in places that haven't experienced them before as water temperatures rise in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With warming waters, we are seeing cases further north," Harwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, cases have been reported in the Carolinas, and even as far north as Connecticut and New York. This year, there have been 17 cases in Louisiana, 16 in Florida and seven in North Carolina. Florida has reported five deaths so far, the most of any state.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can also spread through uncooked seafood, mainly oysters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Billiris says he is more cautious in the water, but he still sails his family's boat nearly every day. He hopes others will recognize the symptoms of an infection, because earlier treatment could mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lot of people waited because they didn't know," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed another case of travel-related dengue on Oahu, bringing the total in the state to 12 so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case comes about a week after the &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/45NmT1J" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;11th reported case&lt;/a&gt; of dengue, which was also on Oahu. A 10th case was reported on Aug. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The affected individual in this current case was exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common,” DOH said, “and is not connected to prior cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said teams have gone to the affected area for inspections and to implement mosquito control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/dengue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is a viral illness spread through mosquito bites. While Hawaii is home to Aedes mosquitoes, which can carry dengue, the disease is not endemic in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are reported frequently in the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands declared dengue outbreaks in 2024 that have continued into 2025. American Samoa, meanwhile, declared a &lt;a href="https://www.americansamoa.gov/_files/ugd/4bfff9_6bafc078fa49425b82c637ad978046de.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; due to a dengue outbreak in early July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public is encouraged to review country-specific guidance on dengue risk and prevention measures at least four to six weeks before traveling. Upon returning from dengue-endemic areas, residents should try to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consuming at least 50% of your grains&lt;/a&gt; from whole grains sources.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains contain the entire bran layer of the grain kernel, meaning they pack more fiber and other nutrients that other refined grains lack. In fact, dietitian &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, MS, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, shares, “One serving of popcorn provides &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;one-third of your daily whole grain needs&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 grams of dietary fiber.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wong points out &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7910393/new-study-whole-grains-waist-size-blood-pressure-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;eating more whole grains&lt;/a&gt; routinely helps nourish your microbiome, "contributing to more predictable bowel movements.”

Antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals–the “bad guys” that may cause harm to our health in the long run. Research has explored the health benefits of popcorn throughout the decades, concluding it has a positive influence on gut health thanks to its polyphenol activity specifically.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ehsani shares, “Popcorn’s polyphenols can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-inflammation-harm-your-gut-health-8715529" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduce inflammation in the gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-gut-health-11681954" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;support the growth of healthy gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Better gut health is possible, but it involves taking a close look at both diet and lifestyle.  Wong shares, “Bowel health isn’t just about eating more fiber — it’s about the whole picture. Managing stress, getting enough sleep, and listening to your body’s natural cues are just as important as what’s on your plate.” Consider these dietitian-recommended tips for better digestion too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular exercise is essential for better bowel health. Wong and Ehsani recommend consistent daily movement in whatever form feels enjoyable. Pick your favorite–a short walk, resistance exercise, or a swim all count. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking water throughout your day helps prevent dehydration, a common culprit in struggling to go number 2. Carry a large reusable water and make a goal to refill it with every mealtime, ensuring you're constantly drinking throughout your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat probiotic rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Probiotics help nourish a healthy gut and aid digestion, helping to keep your bowel movements regular. Consider adding more probiotic rich foods into your diet, like kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, or kombucha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down.&lt;/strong&gt; Being mindful as you eat is important, notes Braddock, as quickly consuming large volumes of food can disrupt your digestion. Consider taking some deep breaths before eating to help calm your nervous system and prepare to properly digest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yes, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more fiber&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Braddock recommends eating more high-fiber fruits and veggies routinely to find relief. She writes, “Raspberries are one of the highest fiber fruits per serving. Plus, eating two kiwis a day can help improve constipation and abdominal discomfort.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smart foods swaps can help improve your gut health—in turn offering relief from constipation that may be weighing you down. While fruits and vegetables are natural choices to swap in for other less nutritious choices, they don’t always satisfy you the same way. That’s why nutrition experts recommend starting small with easy swaps that may be more satisfying, like trying &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-make-popcorn-in-the-microwave-8721280" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;air-popped popcorn in lieu of potato chips&lt;/a&gt; to get that same crunch with more fiber and antioxidants. Fiber is a key component to helping you poop, and every gram counts!

While the growths may look disturbing, officials stressed they do not pose a threat to humans, pets, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The virus only spreads between rabbits, typically through bites from insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. According to the University of Missouri, the condition is a DNA virus ‘seen most frequently in cottontail rabbits of the Midwest with outbreaks in domestic rabbits’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Local Sightings and reactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Collins residents have reported multiple sightings, including one rabbit that returned to a homeowner’s yard for two consecutive years with increasingly severe growths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some residents initially feared the animals had plague or another dangerous illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Descriptions of the appearance range from ‘black quills’ to a ‘scabby growth’ covering parts of the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t,” a local, Susan Mansfield, told NBC local affiliate KUSA.“He came back a second year, and it grew.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Shope Papilloma Virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus causes benign wart-like tumors, but in some cases, these can become malignant (cancerous). While generally not harmful to the rabbit’s overall health, tumors can create problems if they obstruct the mouth, nose, or eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disease is relatively common in wild rabbit populations, particularly during warmer months when insect activity is high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no known cure for the virus; surgical removal of tumors is sometimes performed for domestic rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife is advising residents to keep their distance. The rabbits are not dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 23:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在结肠镜检查中依靠人工智能可能会削弱临床医生的技能- MedPage Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1VcjhINjFOSG1nbzNKN1BSNURmNjZBX05JanZkMXN4V2J2SXRpOWlSTVdZQVNOUWdsRW5rM1ItSW5Nd1JEMTdJbjVqMy1NM2RDUTJvbmtSMEdtZjBoZmtLTFhUalN0QjBNQmlPazllLTBCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content-region mpt-article-page" id="js-main-content-region" itemtype="http://schema.org/articleBody" itemid="#main-content-region"&gt;

                &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The adenoma detection rate (ADR) in more than 1,400 non-AI assisted colonoscopies dropped 6 percentage points, from 28.4% to 22.4%, after endoscopists routinely used the technology in their practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted colonoscopy was not significantly associated with a higher ADR when compared to the detection rates before the technology was introduced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The findings raise concerns about "deskilling" in non-AI colonoscopies performed by endoscopists who routinely use the technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Endoscopists who got used to using artificial intelligence (AI) during colonoscopies detected significantly fewer precancerous growths when the technology was taken away, a study from Poland found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the observational study of more than 1,400 non-AI-assisted colonoscopies, the adenoma detection rate (ADR) dropped from 28.4% in the 3 months before AI was introduced into routine practice to 22.4% in the 3 months after (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.0089), reported Krzysztof Budzyn, MD, of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland, and co-authors in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(25)00133-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Gastroenterology &amp;amp; Hepatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that continuous exposure to AI may lead to "deskilling" when it is not being used, said co-author Marcin Romańczyk, MD, also of the Medical University of Silesia, likening it to drivers being over-reliant on GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine that you want to travel anywhere, and you're unable to use Google Maps," Romańczyk, told &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;. "We call it the Google Maps effect. We try to get somewhere, and it's impossible to use a regular map. It works very similarly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AI-assisted colonoscopy has been shown in randomized trials to boost ADR, the results of this study raise the possibility that the apparent benefit may partly reflect reduced performance without the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budzyn and colleagues noted that since AI implementation, the overall ADR rose from 22.4% to 25.3%, masking the decline in ADR for non-AI-assisted colonoscopy. AI-assisted colonoscopy was not significantly associated with higher ADR when compared to detection rates before its introduction (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63-1.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We assume that continuous exposure to decision support systems such as AI might lead to the natural human tendency to over-rely on their recommendations, leading to clinicians becoming less motivated, less focused, and less responsible when making cognitive decisions without AI assistance," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could reflect weakened visual search habits, altered gaze patterns, dulling pattern recognition, and reduced diagnostic confidence, said Omer Ahmad, MBBS, PhD, of University College London, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(25)00164-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;in an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called for performance-monitoring guidelines from professional societies, educational programs to raise awareness of deskilling, and incorporating non-AI sessions into routine practice to keep skills sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ahmad told &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt; there are no easy solutions. "I do not think there is a quick way to figure this out," he said. "We need high quality studies, perhaps crossover in design, to study both behavioral metrics and outcome measures in AI and non-AI assisted colonoscopies. This would offer insights into how skill erosion may occur."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multicenter study evaluated 1,443 non-AI-assisted colonoscopies (out of 2,177 total colonoscopies) performed by 19 experienced endoscopists at four medical centers in Poland between September 2021 and March 2022. Of those, 795 were conducted before the introduction of regular AI use and 648 were performed after AI was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found ADR varied by gender and age, being higher in men (OR 1.78 vs women, 95% CI 1.38-2.30) and individuals 60 and older (OR 3.60 vs &amp;lt;60 years, 95% CI 2.74-4.72).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledged several limitations, including the study's observational design, which carries a risk of selection bias, and the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors. Only one AI system was used, which means results may not apply to other systems or to less experienced endoscopists, who could be more susceptible to skill loss than the clinicians evaluated in the study who had performed at least 2,000 colonoscopies each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gait analysis and pain measures show that subtly adjusting the angle of the foot during walking may reduce knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. This approach may also slow progression of the condition, an incurable disease in which the cartilage cushion inside a joint breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Led by a team of researchers at NYU Langone Health, the University of Utah, and Stanford University, a new study explored whether changing the way patients position their feet when walking could lessen extra loading—stress on the joint during motion—and help treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the investigation, the scientists tested this intervention in 68 men and women with mild to moderate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/knee+osteoarthritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; and then used advanced MRI scans to track how well it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that those trained to angle their feet slightly inward or outward from their natural alignment experienced slower cartilage degeneration in the inner part of their knee compared with those who were encouraged to walk more frequently without changing their foot position. A report on the study is published online in the journal &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although our results will have to be confirmed in future studies, they raise the possibility that the new, noninvasive treatment could help delay surgery," said study co-lead author Valentina Mazzoli, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazzoli, an assistant professor in the Department of Radiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that the earlier patients receive a knee replacement, the more likely they are to require additional procedures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also revealed that those who adjusted their foot angle reduced their pain score by 2.5 points on a 10-point scale, an effect equivalent to that of over-the-counter pain medications. By contrast, those who did not change their gait reduced their pain scores by little more than a point.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Altogether, our findings suggest that helping patients find their best foot angle to reduce stress on their knees may offer an easy and fairly inexpensive way to address early-stage osteoarthritis," added Mazzoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in seven Americans have some form of osteoarthritis, commonly in the inner side of the knee, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leading cause of disability, the disease is often managed with pharmaceutical pain relievers, physical therapy, and, in the most severe cases, knee-replacement surgery. Experts believe that excess loading can over time contribute to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has offered little evidence that changes in gait can effectively reduce &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/knee+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;knee pain&lt;/a&gt; caused by osteoarthritis, says Mazzoli. Some previous trials trained all participants to adopt the same foot angle and found no relief, while others did not compare the intervention to a control group or only followed the participants for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is the first to show that tailoring each patient's foot angle to their unique walking pattern can alleviate the disease's symptoms in the long term and may slow cartilage breakdown, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazzoli adds that this technique may have a significant advantage over pharmaceutical painkillers. These drugs, she says, do not address the underlying disease and can cause liver and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+damage/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney damage&lt;/a&gt;, stomach ulcers, and other unwanted side effects when taken for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team recorded the participants walking on a treadmill at a specialized gait-assessment laboratory. A computer program simulated their walking patterns and calculated the maximum loading that occurred in the inner side of their knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team generated computer models of four new foot positions—angled inward or outward by either 5 degrees or 10 degrees—and estimated which option reduced loading the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were then randomly divided into two groups. Half were trained in six sessions to walk at their ideal angle while the other half were instructed to continue walking naturally. Pain scores and MRI scans were taken at the beginning of the study period and one year after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study findings showed those who adjusted their gait reduced the maximum loading in the knees by 4%, while those who kept their normal walking pattern increased their loading by more than 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results highlight the importance of personalizing treatment instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach to osteoarthritis," said Mazzoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While this strategy may sound challenging, recent advances in detecting the motion of different body parts using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; may make it easier and faster than ever before."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the authors relied on a specialized laboratory for the new study, artificial intelligence software that estimates joint loading using smartphone videos is now available and can allow clinicians to perform a gait analysis in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers next plan to test whether these tools can indeed identify the most effective walking method for osteoarthritis patients, says Mazzoli. They also plan to expand their study to people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes salt water and brackish water, which is a mixture of salt and freshwater often found where rivers meet the ocean. The bacteria are found particularly along the Gulf Coast states like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are different kinds of Vibrio that can lead to various infections. Vibrio vulnificus can be particularly dangerous because it can cause severe and life-threatening infections. This specific type of bacteria is known as “flesh-eating” because it can destroy muscle tissue and skin. “Many people with [Vibrio] vulnificus wound infection require intensive care or surgical tissue removal,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC says;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-do-people-get-infected"&gt;How do people get infected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are two ways that people can get infected:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-decimal"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When a person’s open wound is exposed to ocean water or seafood contaminated with Vibrio bacteria.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced last week that his department would &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html"&gt;slash about $500 million in mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt; contracts, a hit to an industry already reeling from other public funding cuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those impacts are being felt in Vermont, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other vaccine skeptics in President Donald Trump’s administration have espoused distrust of mRNA technology. But experts say the criticism is by and large inaccurate and the vaccines are safe and effective, having &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/"&gt;saved millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid-19 pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are now at a point where the most efficacious of technologies, because it’s new, is causing fear, and that fear has found a political outlet,” said Dev Majumdar, an immunologist at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine &lt;a href="https://biolab.dev/"&gt;who focuses on RNA biology&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s no question that mRNA vaccines work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When used in vaccines, messenger RNA, known as mRNA, teach cells to create a protein or parts of protein that lead to an immune response, helping protect a person against a disease. Scientists can use the mRNA platform to develop vaccines more quickly, and the method is an alternative to other forms of vaccines, like those that include a weakened form of a pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech used mRNA. Moderna has also developed &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-expanded-use-modernas-rsv-vaccine-at-risk-adults-2025-06-12/"&gt;an mRNA vaccine targeting Respiratory Syncytial Virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as RSV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majumdar, who leads a UVM RNA lab, said scientists should continually prioritize how they talk to the public about vaccines and pandemic preparedness. It’s OK for scientists to acknowledge when past work has failed, he argued, and there should be no shame in celebrating successes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The public is a part of the process, and we have to constantly try to do better to bring the public in,” Majumdar said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vermont, the national debate and federal cuts to vaccine research is having an impact on a significant player in the mRNA manufacturing field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vernal.bio/"&gt;Vernal Biosciences&lt;/a&gt; in Colchester manufactures mRNA — for research and clinical trials — as well as lipid nanoparticles, which help mRNA achieve scientists’ intended uses. &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/06/22/vernal-biosciences-doubles-its-funding-for-manufacturing-mrna/"&gt;With additional investment in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been able to follow stricter federal guidelines with the goal of expanding its client base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billions of dollars in cuts to public financing of research from the likes of the National Institutes of Health have hit the mRNA field hard, said Christian Cobaugh, Vernal’s founder and chief scientific officer. Plus, the industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, was flooded with new players, and demand has since dropped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re all feeling it,” Cobaugh said. “It just takes more money out of the total pool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the impact of reduced public investment, Cobaugh said it ranges from the “specific” to “wait and see.” Cuts to National Institutes of Health grants led Vernal to stop some work mid-contract, he said, in the short-term costing the company in the six figures with a long-term impact in the seven figures. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition to infectious disease vaccines, mRNA use has shown promise in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/12/mrna-vaccine-cancer-research-trump-administration"&gt;treating cancer&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://time.com/6080127/crispr-mrna/"&gt;gene editing therapies&lt;/a&gt;. So far, the latter two applications have not been as targeted by federal funding cuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority mRNA vaccine contract clawbacks mainly impact research and development into infectious diseases, according to Cobaugh. That’s a field central to pandemic preparedness, one that’s long relied on public funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be less prepared” for the next pandemic, he said. “I don’t want people to be scared that we’re not going to be ready for this. We’re just not going to be as ready as we could be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the future of mRNA vaccines in a landscape marred by skeptics, Cobaugh said he believes opposition to the technology is fringe. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“What we’re dealing with here is a fundamental loss in critical thinking skills,” he said. “If people continue to outsource their decisions to politicians of all stripes, we’re going to continue to struggle with technology and where it should fit into our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majumdar fears cuts to vaccine research may harm the industry in ways that won’t become fully clear for a decade or more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s hurt morale a lot among the people who spend 60 to 80 hours per week working on these things,” he said. “I really, really worry that we’re looking at the precipice of a lost generation of young people that really wanted to go into this, that wanted to cure cancer and fight disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

when just a baby, meaning she suffered breathing and digestive problems throughout her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She told &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002gzs1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings programme&lt;/a&gt;

I liked things like dancing, swimming and going to Brownies, but every now and then I'd fall ill and have to go into hospital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Making life even harder for Yvonne was medical research that found cystic fibrosis patients should be kept away from each other.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We grow bacteria in our lungs that can be dangerous to other people with CF," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's the same way that something like Covid would spread, just spreading bacteria amongst us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Science caught up to that and told us you can't mix anymore, so we are the only disease group where we are encouraged not to mix with others."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Survivor's guilt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yvonne recalled standing in a church when she was aged about 20, at the funeral of a childhood friend who had died from cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said she realised at that point the condition was terminal, and was in tears for days afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think I've got survivor's guilt in a way," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When Yvonne was a child, the average life expectancy for patients with the condition was 31, meaning that by the time she reached her 40s, she had already outlived those early expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Yvonne Hughes was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite medical developments that had raised the average life expectancy, Yvonne's lung function had declined to about 30% of what she needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She felt she would not be able to qualify for any new drugs being developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We knew these miracles were happening [&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53705995" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;with new treatments&lt;/a&gt;] but I thought I was too ill to benefit. I'd made plans for my funeral with my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It had been a miracle to get to my mid 40s."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But by 2020 kaftrio had been approved for use in Scotland - a modular drug that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crgpzg7xyjjo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;works to treat the root cause of the illness&lt;/a&gt; by bypassing the genetic errors responsible for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yvonne stresses that kaftrio is not a miracle drug and does not work for everybody, but for her, the effect was instantaneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Energy levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Within hours she was coughing up mucus, and as the days went on she felt her energy levels rising again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The drug needs to be taken with fatty foods, so my dad had to go out and blow the budget on them for me to take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I just remember I opened the door to the delivery guy and said 'you're about to save my life' – and it did.  It's five years later and now I'm at the Fringe, it's bonkers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Inspired by her new-found energy, Yvonne took up a course for comedy at a university's centre for lifelong learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That led to her own shows, and this year's Fringe effort - Absolutely Riddled - which works in her health struggles as part of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That might not sound a recipe for easy laughs, but Yvonne believes it is a "warm and life affirming" show, which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/yvonne-hughes-absolutely-riddled" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;runs until 15 August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She added: "I was in and out of hospital every six to eight weeks before. Now I've got all this energy - sometimes I forgot I've had something wrong with me." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2

the most common inherited life-threatening condition in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It affects the ability of cells to transport salt and water which can cause sticky mucus to build up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It can affect several organs but especially the lungs and the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Symptoms usually appear in childhood and can vary with affected organs becoming damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the average life expectancy has &lt;a target="_blank"

And by people, I mean the wellness-industrial complex and their cadre of barely postpubescent personal trainers who lower the weights if you tell them you’re over 30. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They mean well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, at Tone House gym in New York City, Mickey Crawford, a 61-year-old substance abuse counselor, is dragging a 115-pound weighted sled across the floor while his coach, Alonzo, secretly covertly sandbags. Afroditi Lishman, a 52-year-old New Yorker, is sprinting and bear crawling her way past 20- and 30-somethings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is just the warm up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(L-R) Afroditi Lishman and Crawford lifting weights and doing arm and leg exercises on the bar at Tone House. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo by Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tone House, a sports-performance studio in New York’s NoMad district, is infamous for its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/tone-house-workout-review-48451288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brutal conditioning workouts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;brutal conditioning workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Think pro football training meets bootcamp with a “You can do it!” ethos. Founder Alonzo Wilson built it to make elite training accessible. It’s become a kind of accidental laboratory for debunking bullshit ideas about aging and what older people can do, physically and mentally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because here’s the real story: Aging isn’t about decline. Or at least, it’s not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; about decline — not unless you’re actively neglecting your mind and body. Or, you know, actively being neglected by a medical and cultural system that treats older adults like they’re doddering and breakable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;“It’s my therapy,” Lishman says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s ageism,” says Teresa Liu-Ambrose, a physical therapy professor and Canada Research Chair in healthy eating at the University of British Columbia, when I ask her about the idea that people over a certain age should only do easy workouts. “And a misconception,” she adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Liu-Ambrose should know. She’s been studying aging for decades. Her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMkpWbdL7fBZWiALnEebW8O28x9MykYhS7faO9FJUwo/edit?tab=t.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Power Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain Power Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published by the Archives of Internal Medicine journal in 2010, found that older women who lifted weights once or twice a week for a year improved their executive function. Even seniors showing early signs of cognitive decline saw better outcomes from resistance training than those who didn’t lift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, lifting weights helps your brain. And this, in turn, is crucial for overcoming the mental hurdle that rewriting the cultural script about aging and exercise requires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, spends his work days helping people. “All day long, I listen to other people’s problems and try to help them out,” says Crawford. “The gym is my outlet. Training helps me do my job. I’m a lot calmer, I’m a lot more empathetic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “It’s my therapy,” she says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mental clarity Lishman and Crawford are finding isn’t anecdotal. Liu-Ambrose has seen it in fMRI scans and cognitive tests. “After targeted exercise training, you can see actual... changes in brain function and also an increase in volume,” she says. That’s right. Lifting weights doesn’t just make your muscles bigger, it makes your brain healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Crawford and Lishman performing agility drills. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you’re worried about cognitive decline, working out is a no brainer. Most of us want to maintain the health of our bodies and brains as we get older, but we’ve also sort of collectively accepted the idea that we will all get weaker as we age. What if that’s not universally true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, says that he is now capable of things he wasn’t when he was “in his prime.” These days, he runs three miles after work. “Once upon a time, you couldn’t get me to run one mile,” he tells me. Twenty years ago, Mickey hated running. He tried cross country in high school and detested it. “Now,” he says, laughing, “I somewhat enjoy it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;On the left, Crawford performs weighted walking lunges, and on the right, Tone House Founder Alonzo Wilson coaches Crawford on a barbell back squat. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not that Crawford learned to love something he used to hate, it’s that he learned to do things that improve his health even if they aren’t his favorite activities. And not just in a perfunctory way, either. Crawford is considering running the New York Marathon in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too. “I’ve gained a new mindset,” she says. “Real growth comes from being uncomfortable — and still pushing forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no one’s being reckless. In fact, the smartest people in the room at Tone House, the 50+ crowd, have an especially nuanced sense of limits. “I know when to push and when to stop and when to recover,” Lishman tells me. “I push myself, but I know when it’s time to take a step back and not try to compete with anyone but myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too: “I’ve gained a new mindset.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hard earned wisdom is one of the beautiful ways that aging can make you more adaptive when it comes to training. And it’s exactly what Liu-Ambrose calls “smart progression,” training hard, but with purpose and adaptation. “Too quickly, too hard, and thinking that more is better is what gets people hurt,” she says. “Instead, you reassess every few weeks. If it’s easy, you increase the load. Your body responds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What most people, of any age, fear about intense workouts is getting injured. No one here is naive about the reality of injury. Lishman, for example, trains with two torn menisci and a labrum tear. “I have many injuries,” she says. “But I know how to work around them.” A few days after a tough deadlift session, she noticed her right side, where she has scoliosis, felt tight. So she took a day off. Ten years ago, she says there’s no way she would have missed a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of responsiveness — not pushing through pain, but also not shrinking from challenge — allows Lishman to keep training. “Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” she says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just good judgment. It’s the foundation of long-term strength. Liu-Ambrose has seen it play out again and again in her research. In one of her early studies, she tells me, she worked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older women who already had osteoporosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;older women who already had osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or osteopenia — conditions that compromise bone health. In case you aren’t aware, bone density issues disproportionately affect older women. Women have lower bone density than men to begin with, and bone loss speeds up with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hormonal shifts that come with menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;hormonal shifts that come with menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Through carefully designed, progressive resistance training, the women who participated in Liu-Ambrose’s study didn’t just preserve function ― they improved it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had participants tell us that they hadn’t been able to take a bath for years,” she says. They were simply not strong enough to get down into the tub and back out again. “We saw a lot of transformation,” says Liu-Ambrose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That kind of transformation is mental and physical, but it’s also social. “It’s not just Tone House the workout, it’s Tone House the community,” says Crawford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “I’m going to five different weddings this year, and they’re all Tone House people,” she says. Through fitness, Crawford and Lishman have found belonging across age, ability, and even generation. “My 20-year-old son goes, ‘It’s a family affair,’” Afroditi says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That sense of family and community matters. “Socializing, in itself, is a cognitive task,” Liu-Ambrose says. “Exercise is good, but when you add social interactions to it, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnifies the benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;magnifies the benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;“Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” Lishman says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And community is what will motivate you and keep you coming back, even if you’re pushing into over the hill territory. “You are never too old to start,” Afroditi says. “Start where you are, meet your body where it is. Don’t compare yourself to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can handle it. Find you. Find your community,” Crawford adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t want to age the ways capitalism is selling. Our choices for old age seem to be either slowly withering into an armchair or desperately clinging to youth. But that’s not real. Crawford and Lishman aren’t superhuman. They’re just not buying what anti-aging culture is selling. They’re lifting heavier. Running farther. Thinking more clearly. And maybe most importantly, they’re not doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1QRUdvV3d5bE9OeHZDeTctbk9SRWZiS2s3Yk84eWFlT0ZQZmxuLVRZMi1TNjg5bTVwMmpseUVoUTZDYVF1UmRRU0Q0UXRaVVAtaHo1M292MXNkd1VWVGVwcE8yS0FBQU5fWWhVUnVpNGpmLTl6QkVVWGlvOUs</guid></item><item><title>这些健身图标在健身房比我们大多数人都更难。而且他们都超过50岁。-赫芬顿邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQU1Rnd1UtYi1mWUdWb1pTQ0x5RzcyUzRLVjFyM0RhUWVBR2Nkb1NERkxTb3F3dGpldk9aZVBsUFpLSndWTWt6WkQwaUFXeC00UVZpbno4UHI3bGtjY1FxYUF0NGp4RmV5U05UWlZQdHItWXpXbmFJUDMyUlFpN1BXalZtUjE2Qk5SbC02eURkLWZBTWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="word-1 first-three-words"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="word-2 first-three-words"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="word-3 first-three-words"&gt;pervasive&lt;/span&gt; myth about aging in our culture is that your body is winding down and the best you can do is manage the decline with grace.

Ten years ago, she says there’s no way she would have missed a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of responsiveness — not pushing through pain, but also not shrinking from challenge — allows Lishman to keep training. “Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” she says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just good judgment. It’s the foundation of long-term strength. Liu-Ambrose has seen it play out again and again in her research. In one of her early studies, she tells me, she worked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="older women who already had osteoporosis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;older women who already had osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or osteopenia — conditions that compromise bone health. In case you aren’t aware, bone density issues disproportionately affect older women. Women have lower bone density than men to begin with, and bone loss speeds up with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="hormonal shifts that come with menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;hormonal shifts that come with menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Through carefully designed, progressive resistance training, the women who participated in Liu-Ambrose’s study didn’t just preserve function ― they improved it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had participants tell us that they hadn’t been able to take a bath for years,” she says. They were simply not strong enough to get down into the tub and back out again. “We saw a lot of transformation,” says Liu-Ambrose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That kind of transformation is mental and physical, but it’s also social. “It’s not just Tone House the workout, it’s Tone House the community,” says Crawford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “I’m going to five different weddings this year, and they’re all Tone House people,” she says. Through fitness, Crawford and Lishman have found belonging across age, ability, and even generation. “My 20-year-old son goes, ‘It’s a family affair,’” Afroditi says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That sense of family and community matters. “Socializing, in itself, is a cognitive task,” Liu-Ambrose says. “Exercise is good, but when you add social interactions to it, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="magnifies the benefits" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;magnifies the benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” Lishman says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose.

Don’t compare yourself to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can handle it. Find you. Find your community,” Crawford adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t want to age the ways capitalism is selling. Our choices for old age seem to be either slowly withering into an armchair or desperately clinging to youth. But that’s not real. Crawford and Lishman aren’t superhuman. They’re just not buying what anti-aging culture is selling. They’re lifting heavier. Running farther. Thinking more clearly. And maybe most importantly, they’re not doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice.

            For thousands of years, a disease repeatedly struck ancient Eurasia, quickly spreading far and wide. The bite of infected fleas that lived on rats passed on the plague in its most infamous form — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/science/plague-gene-evolution"&gt;the Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of the 14th century — to humans, and remains its most common form of transmission today.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000x3b6n2ijh90tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the Bronze Age, however, the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, had not yet developed the genetic tool kit that would allow later strains to be spread by fleas. Scientists have been baffled as to how the illness could have persisted at that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000y3b6nrfe5sljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, an international team of researchers has recovered the first ancient Yersinia pestis genome from a nonhuman host — a Bronze Age domesticated sheep that lived around 4,000 years ago in what is now&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;modern-day Russia. The discovery has allowed the scientists to better understand the transmission and ecology of the disease in the ancient past, leading them to believe that livestock played a role in its spread throughout Eurasia. The findings were published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00851-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425008517%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000z3b6n9e4z9o7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yersinia pestis is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/about-zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank"&gt;zoonotic&lt;/a&gt; disease (transmitted between humans and animals) that emerged during prehistory, but so far the way that we have studied it using ancient DNA has been completely from human remains, which left us with a lot of questions and few answers about how humans were getting infected,” said lead author Ian Light-Maka, a doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. There have been nearly 200 Y. pestis genomes recovered from ancient humans, the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00103b6nyfs1jfh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finding the ancient bacterium in an animal not only helps researchers understand how the bacterial lineage evolved, but it could also have implications for understanding modern diseases, Light-Maka added via email. “Evolution can sometimes be ‘lazy,’ finding the same type of solution independently for a similar problem — the genetic tools that worked for pestis to thrive for over 2000 years across over Eurasia might be reused again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00113b6no6szhgrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ancient bacterium that caused the Eurasia plague, known today as the Late Neolithic Bronze Age lineage, spread from Europe all the way to Mongolia, with evidence of the disease found across 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00123b6n26ha3dl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent evidence suggests that the majority of modern human diseases emerged within the last 10,000 years and coincided with the domestication of animals such as livestock and pets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093834" target="_blank"&gt;release &lt;/a&gt;from the German research institute. Scientists suspected that animals other than rodents were a part of the enormous puzzle of the Bronze Age plague transmission, but without any bacterial genomes recovered from animal hosts, it was not clear which ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00133b6nsodqv64g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find the ancient plague genome, the study authors investigated Bronze Age animal remains from an archaeological site in Russia known as Arkaim. The settlement was once associated with a culture called Sintashta-Petrovka, known for its innovations in livestock. There, the researchers discovered the missing connection — the tooth of a 4,000-year-old sheep that was infected with the same plague bacteria found in humans from that area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00143b6naqbxl0po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finding infected livestock suggests that the domesticated sheep served as a bridge between the humans and infected wild animals, said Dr. Taylor Hermes, a study coauthor and an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Arkansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00153b6n2h9ow08v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re sort of unveiling this in real time and trying to get a sense for how Bronze Age nomadic herders out in the Eurasian &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/the-Steppe" target="_blank"&gt;Steppe&lt;/a&gt; were setting the stage for disease transmission that potentially led to impacts elsewhere,” Hermes said, “not only in later in time, but also in a much more distant, distant landscape.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00163b6n6ol9xark@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During this time within the Eurasian Steppe, as many as 20% of the bodies in some cemeteries are those of people who were infected with, and most likely died from, the plague, making it an extremely pervasive disease, Hermes said. While livestock are seemingly a part of what made the disease so widespread, they are only one piece of the puzzle. The identification of the bacterial lineage in an animal opens new avenues for researching this disease’s evolution as well as the later lineage that caused the Black Death in Europe and the plague that’s still around today, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not surprising, but it is VERY cool to see (the DNA) isolated from an ancient animal. It’s extremely difficult to find it in humans and even more so in animal remains, so this is really interesting and significant,” Hendrik Poinar, evolutionary geneticist and director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, wrote in an email. Poinar was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00183b6nc2z63jwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is likely that humans and animals were passing the strains back and forth, but it isn’t clear how they did so — or how sheep were infected in the first place. It is possible sheep picked up the bacteria through a food or water source and then transmitted the disease to humans via the animal’s contaminated meat, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00193b6na9joy3r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it shows how extremely successful (if you want to label it that way) this particular pathogen has been,” Poinar added. He, as well as the study’s authors, said they hope that further research uncovers other animals infected with the ancient strain to further the understanding of the disease’s spread and evolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While the plague lineage that persisted during the Bronze Age is extinct, Yersinia pestis is still around in parts of Africa and Asia as well as the western United States, Brazil and Peru. But it’s rare to encounter the bacteria, with only 1,000 to 2,000 cases of plague annually &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" target="_blank"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There is no need for alarm when it comes to dealing with livestock and pets, Hermes said. The findings are a reminder that animals carry diseases that are transmittable to humans. Be cautious when cooking meat, or to take care when bitten by an animal, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr001c3b6n1nu1qgsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The takeaway is that humans aren’t alone in disease, and this has been true for thousands of years. The ways we are drastically changing our environment and how wild and domesticated animals are connected to us have the potential to change how disease can come into our communities,” Light-Maka said. “And if you see a dead prairie dog, maybe don’t go and touch it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Eyewitness News 3, anybody who encounters the infected rabbits must avoid all contact and stay away from them, even though it doesn't consider CPRV to be contagious across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Researchers suggest that the 'Frankenstein' variations could spread throughout the Midwest, carried by mosquitoes and ticks which bite the infected ones and transport their hideous conditions as opposed to direct contact between rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As for how CRPV affects the host, it all begins with red, raised spots on the skin that eventually mutate into warty masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The next phase of infection is the emergence of black tendrils covering the mouth, cheek and eye areas, although some of the initial warts can in fact transform into life-threatening skin &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The furry mammals cannot spread the cottontail papilloma virus themselves, only through insect transportation (Reddit)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wlbt.com/2025/08/09/rabbits-spotted-with-tentacle-like-growths-their-faces/"&gt;Speaking to&lt;/a&gt; WLBT3 about the horror of it all, Fort Collins resident Susan Mansfield said about witnessing an infected rabbit out in the open: "It looked like black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I thought he'd die off during the winter, but he didn't. He came back a second year – and it grew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Medical experts are urging domestic rabbit owners to keep their pets away from pests, but if they do succumb to a mosquito bite, vets can surgically remove the tumours before malignancy sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Out in the wild, the infected patients are likely to starve to death when their horns grow larger and larger, effectively eliminating their ability to see, eat or hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;One of the infected specimens pictured in Colorado (Reddit)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In similarly stomach-churning news, did you know that kilograms of the parasitic fungus that inspired &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;can sell for as much as $110,000?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Labelled 'ophiocordyceps unilateralis', or the zombie-ant fungus, it kills insects before commandeering their corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It also comes in several different forms, often differentiated by the animal that the fungus takes over, and one particular type found in caterpillars called Cordyceps militaris or 'Scarlet Caterpillarclub' is available on the market and has some alleged medical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some Cordyceps species are traditionally used in Chinese medicine and cuisine, but there's no evidence to suggest that ophiocordyceps unilateralis can be safely consumed by humans - so do not try it at home!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:43:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQa2E1Vk5XdDlNSUZBMGl5VDVsTm9jS2VNQU04QXNUTEpZZktrOXFoOW9SNWVsM0VfUGRTejMzWlR1SllBS1FDM3dQOG5yaW5hVG9VNzdVM09lRThBQjFMMUR0eTFyYllJazg4SVJYcU8xYWVQTWdVcE02YXZucW15MzRMc3dVcFdUaTI1S2JoTUg4X2tVNTUySjFKWUVhT19yZVJpdk9lY3Q</guid></item><item><title>“高峰时间” ：西尼罗河病毒的风险目前在10个马萨诸塞州社区中居高不下。以下是列表-波士顿25新闻</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;BOSTON — The risk for West Nile virus is now high in 10 Massachusetts communities, state public health officials said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;The risk level for the mosquito-borne virus has been elevated in the following municipalities: Acton, Bedford, Billerica, Boston, Brookline, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, and Newton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Tuesday’s announcement comes as &lt;a href="https://www.boston25news.com/weather/air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfire-smoke-thick-across-massachusetts-today/TDNB3M3ZZBGRJD3QTIZDCJIB7I/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.boston25news.com/weather/air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfire-smoke-thick-across-massachusetts-today/TDNB3M3ZZBGRJD3QTIZDCJIB7I/"&gt;the region is experiencing a heat wave&lt;/a&gt;

There were four human cases of EEE in Massachusetts last year with one death and three animal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;“WNV findings in mosquitoes have accelerated rapidly over the last several weeks,” State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “We are now in the peak time for transmission of mosquito-borne disease to people and it is important for people to know that so they can take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;State officials shared the following tips to help prevent mosquito bites and the transmission of the virus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid mosquito bites and be aware of peak mosquito hours. &lt;/b&gt;The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening, after 6 p.m. or early morning. Otherwise, take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitoes can be active during daylight hours when the temperatures are cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites.&lt;/b&gt; Although it may be difficult to do when it is hot, wearing long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apply insect repellent when you go outdoors&lt;/b&gt;. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023) or oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants younger than 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children younger than 3 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mosquito-proof your Home and drain standing water.&lt;/b&gt; Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install or repair screens.&lt;/b&gt; Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having tightly fitted screens on all windows and doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect your animals. &lt;/b&gt;Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;If an animal is suspected of having West Nile Virus or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617- 983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;More information, including all West Nile Virus- and EEE-positive results can be found at this &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the DPH Division of Epidemiology at 617-983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.

			&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods already have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;lousy reputation&lt;/a&gt; – and now a new study suggests that even 'healthy' versions of them can significantly undermine your weight-loss efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the UK and US analyzed data from 50 overweight people who completed two diet programs on separate occasions. Both diets matched &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why"&gt;in terms of nutrition&lt;/a&gt; – with the same amounts of fat (including saturated fats), carbs, fiber, salt, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-and-vegetables-have-a-surprising-effect-on-depression-risk"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference is one diet was built around &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs), and the other focused on minimally processed foods (MPFs). The UPF diet included the likes of breakfast oat bars and lasagne ready meals, while the MPF one featured overnight oats and homemade spaghetti bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both diets resulted in weight loss. But the MPF diet was associated with shedding twice as much weight as the UPF diet, on average. Participants also lost more unhealthy body fat while on the MPF diet and reported better control over unhealthy &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-you-can-resist-food-cravings-and-stick-to-healthy-eating"&gt;food cravings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous research has linked ultra-processed foods with poor health outcomes," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical scientist Samuel Dicken, from University College London (UCL). "But not all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy based on their nutritional profile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main aim of this trial was to fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about the role of food processing in the context of existing dietary guidance, and how it affects health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure, and body composition, as well as experiential factors like food cravings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170263" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170263" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss.jpg" alt="Weight loss graph" class="wp-image-170263 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss-449x415.jpg 449w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss-600x555.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170263" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Greater weight loss was seen with the minimally processed food diet. (Dicken et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall reductions in weight were only 2 percent for the MPF diet and 1 percent for the UPF diet, the researchers point out the short timespan of the study: eight weeks for each diet, with a gap of four weeks in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes seen here could quickly add up. In combination with other factors that contribute &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;to a healthy and effective diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;avoiding ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; could make a noticeable difference over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though a 2 percent reduction may not seem very big, that is only over eight weeks and without people trying to actively reduce their intake," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we scaled these results up over the course of a year, we'd expect to see a 13 percent weight reduction in men and a 9 percent reduction in women on the minimally processed diet, but only a 4 percent weight reduction in men and 5 percent in women after the ultra-processed diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was relatively small and excluded people with dietary restrictions, but it offers more evidence on how we can tackle our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;growing obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; – and highlights the difference that &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;following nutritional guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in diets can have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The global food system at the moment drives diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide availability of cheap, unhealthy food," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Chris van Tulleken, a global health and infection researcher at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt, and sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
