He was soon hospitalized, ventilated and then died. Postmortem testing confirmed rabies, the CDC report said, baffling authorities because the recipient’s family had said he had not had any exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors then reviewed records about the kidney donor, a man in Idaho, and discovered that in the Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire he said he had been scratched by a skunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked, the family explained that a couple of months before, in October, while he was holding a kitten in a shed on his country property, a skunk approached, showing “predatory aggression toward the kitten”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man fought off the animal in an encounter that the report says “rendered the skunk unconscious”, but not before the man received a “shin scratch that bled”, although he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Five weeks later, a family member said, he became confused, had difficulty walking swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations and had a stiff neck. Two days later, he was found unresponsive at home after a presumed cardiac arrest. Although he was resuscitated and hospitalized, he never regained consciousness, and after several days was “declared brain dead and removed from life support”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report states that several of his organs, including his left kidney, were donated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, authorities went back to test laboratory samples from the donor; they tested negative for rabies. But biopsy samples directly from his kidneys did detect a strain “consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies”, suggesting that he had, in fact, died of rabies and had passed it on to the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The investigation suggested a “likely three-step transmission chain” in which a bat infected a skunk, which infected the donor, whose kidney then infected the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it was only the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978. It noted that the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After discovering that three people also received cornea grafts from the same donor, authorities immediately removed the grafts and administered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. The three people remained asymptomatic, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC report stated that in the US, family members often provide information about a prospective donor’s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures. Rabies is typically “excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the United States and the complexity of diagnostic testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic co-morbidities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lara Danziger-Isakov, the director of immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, described the incident as “an exceptionally rare event”, adding that “overall, the risk is exceptionally small”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWnhPUGlzVGYzT3Mycl8yYjFIWGYyODNseUxPdnhqMVFlLTZma0tXdDVqSC1UNnpnNi05d2VVSWZ1Um5DUUF6Z2FTUEVTemM5QzhOVkE4SXhZVEpicW5nbEZEU1pySzFWd2s0VG9uV0xqTmlOSkxMeHdlNkxLVENwRk1uZjd3NUk</guid></item><item><title>饱和脂肪实际上对你有好处吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/well/eat/saturated-fat-health-risks-dietary-guidelines.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:42:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPdmw1NmxhREVROGIxM3NXRld6UF9sMFVuZFE0VTA1Y2dsS0x0cHJGRUZHUEdnNTNGMXZ6RkNZRHpwekxLZ1F2c00tX05TX2Q2am1kaXJKTmRKMEg1OTJ2a3lMUnJtNFhNa1kxRF93dHBLV1k2Qk04R3ZSYWlXMkE5N2pBYTdPTGIzUkJxeWdNRnBQS0ZNb0R4cVd3</guid></item><item><title>人们正在分享他们完全忽视的“健康危险信号” ，直到它导致了重大诊断，哦，我的上帝- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyzinman/health-red-flags-people-ignored</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I went to see our family doctor because my arm was hurting for over a week. He diagnosed it as 'tennis elbow' and told me to take anti-inflammatories. Weeks later, I lost most of the feeling in my hand, so I was given nerve conduction tests, then imaging. It turned out I had under 50% of the normal nerve conduction, because I'd originally broken my arm and it healed badly, crushing the nerve in my elbow. I needed urgent surgery to chisel away the extra bone around the nerve. The neurosurgeon doing the operation injected the local anesthetic and waited for it to go numb. He checked my sensation and I could feel everything. Another shot. Same result. I told him to go ahead and I'd just put up with it. It was a tad painful, to say the least. If you imagine somebody literally chiselling away at your funny bone carefully for 4 hours, you'll get some idea. The nurse on my side said she'd never seen someone in that much pain before."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"At least the operation was successful, though the surgeon afterwards said he should have done it under a general anesthetic. I agree! 😩"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Jamie, UK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A barrage of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/social-media-children-brain-rot"&gt;AI-generated brain rot&lt;/a&gt; is haunting children across numerous screens, from personal smartphones to school-issued laptops to televisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Social media is adding significantly to that cacophony, making it harder than ever for kids to concentrate. Now, new research from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University has found a significant link between screen time and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that exposing young brains to social media could have major mental health implications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatricsopenscience/article/doi/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922/205729/Digital-Media-Genetics-and-Risk-for-ADHD-Symptoms?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics Open Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers followed 8,324 children aged nine to ten years old in the US for four years. The children self-reported how much time they spent on social media, watching TV, or playing video games. Their parents also assessed their ability to pay attention and any signs of hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;There was a clear link between social media use and an attention deficit, raising the possibility that the constant sensory assault by online services like TikTok and Snapchat could be robbing kids of the ability to focus. That’s in contrast to TV or video game use, which showed no clear association with symptoms of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” said coauthor and Karolinska Institutet professor of cognitive neuroscience Torkel Klingberg in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers found that over the four years, children went from spending an average of 30 minutes a day to 2.5 hours a day on social media. Meanwhile, inattention symptoms also increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction,” Klingberg added. “This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While it’s always hard to figure out causation in research like this, one clue is that children who were already struggling with symptoms of ADHD at the outset of the study didn’t start using social media more, suggesting that its use leads to inattentiveness, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Importantly, there was no evidence of reverse association, as average inattention symptoms did not predict increased social media use,” the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Interestingly, an increase in social media use was shown to have no effect on hyperactivity, which is also a symptom associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Although the effect size is small at the individual level, it could have significant consequences if behavior changes across population level,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As such, the number of ADHD diagnoses in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/23/1252941968/adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-1-in-9-u-s-kids-have-gotten-one-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2024.2335625" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, one in nine US kids is now living with the disorder, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizing it as an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/19960/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;expanding public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As of 2022, there were over seven million kids and adolescents in the US with a diagnosis of the condition, up from just over six million in 2016, a significant rise in only a matter of six years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to Klingberg, social media may have contributed to the trend over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers stressed that their findings didn’t establish explicit, causative links and that social media use doesn’t necessarily imply a child will develop ADHD symptoms. However, they suggest parents should discuss limiting the time children spend on social media each day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said first author and Karolinska Institutet postdoctoral researcher Samson Nivins, in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Neurology Department at Allegheny General Hospital’s Hemlock Building, Abigail Bailey’s body folded forward in her chair.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her muscles tightened as if someone had forced the air from her lungs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her nose burned, her chest hitched and she gripped the chair’s armrests to keep from collapsing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail’s younger sister reached out and gently brushed a section of hair from her face.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt it kick in,” Abigail said. It was her physical reaction to her brain wirelessly connecting to the laptop sitting on the examination bed next to her Friday.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abigail, 24, of Hookstown in Beaver County, has lived and struggled with Tourette syndrome for more than two decades. But it wasn’t until last year — when a bladder infection led to sepsis and triggered a spike in painful motor and vocal tics — that she chose to pursue an experimental treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, she underwent a two-part deep-brain stimulation procedure. Surgeons implanted a device that delivers electrical impulses to targeted areas of the brain to treat motor disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘It’s time. I don’t even care what it takes. I just want my life back. I want to be happy,’” Abigail said, remembering the constant physical pain her uncontrolled tics put her through.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, eight months later, she is working full-time, living independently and preparing for her 2026 wedding.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spirits were high Friday as Abigail, joined by her sister Emily Bailey and her mother Colleen Bailey, visited the Allegheny Health Network hospital in Pittsburgh’s North Side. It was a routine visit to recalibrate the electrodes in her brain to help minimize the involuntary movements associated with Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgical Physician Assistant Amanda Webb pointed to the different parts of Abigail’s brain they were targeting on the laptop’s screen. Everyone in the room was struck by the technology and shared memories of times when Abigail’s tics were less controlled.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the nature of their visit, everyone in the hospital room laughed and told stories to the doctors and staff.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If anybody in the world should’ve had Tourette, it was Abby — because she handled it like a pro,” said Colleen.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Not curable’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail, who grew up on a farm in Hookstown, was 3 years old when her parents began to notice symptoms of Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourette’s is a neurological disorder marked by sudden, repetitive, uncontrollable movements and sounds, with symptoms typically beginning between ages 5 and 10, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition can become dangerous when tics lead to accidental self-injury.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abigail’s case, she has broken several fingers and even her ribs during severe tic episodes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t realize until middle school how disruptive her tics had become. By high school, she was attending a modified schooling program.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her tics became an issue when she distracted her classmates and interrupted lessons.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were points in her life when she was younger, when she was like a fish flopping on the ground,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started noticing the older I got the … worse it was getting,” Abigail said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began to feel she was reverting back to childhood as she lost control of her body.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Abigail spent a week each year at a camp for people with Tourette’s and their families. There, she made friends with other kids who shared her condition and heard stories of the severe bullying many of them faced.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was eye opening,” said Emily, her sister.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abigail said she never faced bullying or cruelty from other students, many of her teachers didn’t understand her condition.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Abigail entered elementary school, Colleen met with the school board to discuss Tourette’s. She distributed handmade guidebooks explaining the condition and how to respond to it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did everything we could in order to learn about Tourette’s, because it was devastating for us to find out. But you know, your daughter has something that’s not curable, and as a mom, you want to solve everything, because that’s your job, and you can’t solve it. So you have to learn everything about it,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail graduated from Eastern Gateway Community College with a degree in social work, before attending Robert Morris University, in pursuit of a degree in health services administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Everything pretty much revolved around my tics’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Abigail called her mother. She was extremely sick and scared.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘Mom, I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do anything. I need your help,’ ” said Colleen, teary-eyed in the waiting room of the neurologist, before the Friday check-in appointment. “I didn’t know she had gotten that bad again. It was so bad she couldn’t do anything. It was horrible.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time she became ill, Abigail was living on her own and working as a case manager at a pharmaceutical company, helping people with chronic illnesses access care and develop treatment plans.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hospitalized with sepsis, Abigail’s tics worsened drastically. She was placed on multiple different medications that left her feeling unlike herself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She barely remembers that month,” Colleen said.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dr. Donald Whiting performed two surgeries — one to place the electrodes in her brain and a second to connect them to a pacemaker or “battery” inside Abigail’s chest.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, there’s circuits that connect to different structures in the brain that help modulate that activity and make sure that everything is moving smoothly … so by putting an electrode into one of those two areas and adjusting the electricity, we regulate that relay center,” said Whiting, chair of Allegheny Health Network’s Neuroscience Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail is one of only a handful of patients Whiting has performed deep-brain stimulation surgery on for Tourette’s. The Bailey family came across Whiting while researching the treatment when Abigail was still in high school, but it wasn’t until she got sick that they decided to go through with it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was so scared, as a high schooler, of somebody operating on her brain,” Colleen said. “We researched Dr. Whiting, and we knew he was the best in the field. He’d been doing it for 20 years.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, insurance companies don’t always approve it because it is still considered experimental for Tourette syndrome, Whiting said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Abigail’s insurance covered the procedure. With the machine’s help, which runs 24 hours a day, she is able to live her life again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is more personal, but the coolest thing in this job is to really be able to make a difference in people’s lives, and particularly young people like her. This is really just amazing that she’s now going to have a life, to get married and live in a house, get a job.” Whiting said. “To me, that’s just what it’s all about.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail has been engaged to her high school sweetheart, Shane Smith, since June 2024. In August&lt;ins&gt; 2025&lt;/ins&gt;, she started a new job as a patient service representative for Heritage Valley Health System. Planning for the 2026 wedding is well underway.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything pretty much revolved around my tics,” Abigail said. “You just have to get through it. … There’s life at the end of the tunnel, we (people with Tourette’s) just have to make it there.”

&lt;/p&gt;

                Over 100 million people in the United States are estimated to have allergies each year – be they seasonal, topical, or food-related.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some allergy each year. That's about every 1 in 3 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many, the fix is a bandaid: over-the-counter allergy medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's another treatment that works to lessen these reactions rather than just manage people's symptoms, allergy shots. The treatment has been around for over a century and is still popular today. Patients have to take the shots for a few years, and it's the closest thing science has to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G.

That’s how you lose fat, that’s how you stay full (and) lean.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of regular foods with low calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adi broke down her food list into three distinct groups. The first included foods that are “high-volume, low-calorie, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-says-these-15-high-fiber-fruits-vegetables-and-lentils-can-help-control-hunger-and-weight-loss-naturally-101764586193271.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="high-fibre"&gt;high-fibre&lt;/a&gt;” and can keep us feeling full without significantly increasing the calorie count and derailing the weight-loss journey. Such foods include the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg whites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yoghurt (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All leafy greens (spinach, arugula, lettuce)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrating veggies (cucumber, tomato, zucchini)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots (smack them raw — also great for your teeth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin/squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone broth (big volume, almost no calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles (super filling, almost zero calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air-popped popcorn (3 cups = nothing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of lean proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the building blocks of our body and are absolutely essential for muscle growth. As such, lean proteins are an important part of the diet to stay healthy, even as we cut weight. Adi’s proteins of choice are listed as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;White fish (cod, tilapia)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controlling the intake of carbohydrates is essential for hitting the weight loss target, the energy-rich food group is also necessary for vital functions. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates yet support fat loss as as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes (one of the most filling foods on earth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats (huge volume when cooked with water)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rice cakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lentils + beans (absolute health powerhouse)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Adi highlights the benefits of the above foods, stating that they allow us to fill our tummy with big portions, provide nutrition without empty calories and thus make fat loss easier with fewer cravings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

'Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin [could not] partake in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joyce was forced to miss many of the joyful early days of college life, including living in the dorms, going to OSU football games, and attending classes as well as being unable to pursue her passion for dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is one of the most common in the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder due to the Epstein-Barr virus at the beginning of the school year and the dancer was left bed-ridden before passing on Saturday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending a significant amount of time in hospital with her mother, Terese seen on the left and Joyce's father Sean on the right, Joyce's condition 'took a sudden turn for the worse'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most who contract the virus show no symptoms, which include fatigue, fever, inflammation of the liver and throat, rash, swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who do present symptoms, which typically appear as teens or adults, recover in around two to four weeks. Currently, there is no specific treatment for EBV and no vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Joyce, her immune system became compromised and her organs suffered 'extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid,' the GoFundMe said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her condition only worsened and she succumbed to the illness after a months-long fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cailin was a bright, joyful, faith-filled young woman whose presence touched so many. She will be remembered by the JOY she brought to everyone she met. She lit up every room she walked in,' the fundraiser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team, which celebrated third place in the NCA &amp;amp; NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her teammates wrote on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR-IZUOjgHe/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;that Joyce 'embodied everything that our team represented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was kind, humble, determined, loyal and oh so funny. She danced with a fire behind her eyes and a passion that could move mountains. She made everyone around her better. Her full out love for life was contagious. Everyone that crossed paths with Cailin knew that she was special,' the post said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her teammates on the Ohio State Clubs Dance Team wrote that Joyce, seen with a fellow competitor on her team, 'embodied everything that our team represented'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A close friend and dance teammate of Joyce wrote that the teenager was and 'abundance of kindness and passion and selflessness and love'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce was forced to miss many of the joyful early days of college life, including living in the dorms, going to OSU football games, and attending classes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thank you for changing our lives.

We know you are dancing full out in Heaven and we can’t wait to dance with you again one day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A close friend and dance teammate of Joyce wrote that the teenager was and 'abundance of kindness and passion and selflessness and love.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You were overflowing with God’s love. He was in every word that you said, every step you took, and every dance you danced. I’ve never seen someone shine the love of Christ the way you did,' she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You changed the life of everyone that crossed your path, without even trying. Because that’s just who you were. You were everything and more. An angel on Earth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another long friend of the teen said in a separate &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR5Qv5OknYW/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;: 'My sweet Cailin, there will never be a day that I won’t miss you. You have been my best friend since the beginning, and I will forever miss our time together. You have truly made my life so full with all of our unforgettable memories and countless hours spent laughing together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You made life so much sweeter, and I am forever grateful to be able to know you and to be known by you. You were the light in every room you were in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There aren’t enough words to explain how much of a positive impact you had on my life and so many others. I know now you are at peace with the lord and dancing in heaven. I will carry you with me forever. I love you,' her friend wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'cherished' daughter leaves behind her parents, Sean and Terese, and her older brother, Sean, as well as her grandfather, aunts, uncles and cousins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce, seen with her older brother Sean, graduated from high school in May 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 'cherished' daughter leaves behind her parents, Sean and Terese, and her older brother, Sean, as well as her grandfather, aunts, uncles and cousins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cailin lived life to the fullest and was a light to so many in her far too short life. She lived her Catholic faith and shared it with many,' her obituary said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A saint among us, Cailin moved mountains with her fight and going “full out." The purest soul and loving sister to older brother Sean.

Every year, like clockwork, we see a spike in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-of-experience-shares-5-early-warning-signs-of-sudden-heart-attacks-starts-in-the-centre-101765017532465.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, around Christmas and New Year's. In fact, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/christmas" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; Eve is the highest risk day of the year. Well, why does this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behaviour and holiday habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to Dr London, drastic changes in eating and drinking habits during the holidays can put extra strain on the heart, increasing the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “First is our behaviour. We drink too much, we eat too much, and we tend to move less around the holidays.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The holiday season also brings a surge of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress &lt;/a&gt;- from financial pressures to social obligations and packed schedules - all of which can quietly elevate the risk of heart attacks. Dr London highlights, “Next is stress - emotional stress, financial stress, the increased pace of the holidays, increased obligations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cold weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The heart surgeon explains that cold weather causes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-explains-why-your-heart-attack-risk-doubles-at-night-this-is-when-blood-vessels-tighten-blood-pressure-101757039051096.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood vessels"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; to constrict, reducing blood flow, thereby raising the risk of heart attacks. He explains, “Cold weather causes vasoconstriction which increases the risk of plaque rupture and potential heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Amid the celebrations and holiday cheer, people often ignore their body’s warning signs, brushing off symptoms and delaying medical attention - and sometimes that can lead to serious complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr London puts it as, “And finally, is delay. I don't feel good but I'll wait till after holiday dinner to get checked out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to prevent holiday heart attacks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr London outlines four precautionary measures you can adopt to prevent unnecessary complications during the holidays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Movement is medicine: Maintain or increase your activity level. Dr London recommends getting out and exercising every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t skip your meds: Set an alarm on your phone as a reminder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritise sleep and mindfulness: Taking care of yourself during this stressful time is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t ignore symptoms: If you feel like something is off, don’t ignore it.

							&lt;p&gt;Strength doesn’t always announce itself loudly. Sometimes it shows up in the small, thoughtful ways people speak to us when we need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I think about people with genuinely strong personalities, I’m reminded of how gentle they often are in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use language that grounds people instead of shaking them, and psychology consistently shows that supportive communication is one of the biggest markers of emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve noticed over the years, both in my own relationships and while diving into the research around behavior and communication, is that strong personalities tend to gravitate toward certain phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t catchphrases or motivational slogans. They’re simple sentences that make others feel understood, valued, and capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I want to share seven of those phrases with you. They’re small, but trust me, they carry weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) “I see why you’d feel that way.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something incredibly calming about feeling understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase offers instant validation without taking sides, which is one of the most psychologically grounding things you can do for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities know that people aren’t usually asking to be fixed. They’re asking to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence does exactly that because it shows that you listened long enough to recognize the emotional logic behind what someone is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a version of this habit while traveling through Japan in my twenties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations there emphasized harmony and understanding, and people took their time acknowledging each other’s feelings before offering any kind of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, whenever I use this phrase, I can almost feel that same &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-7-daily-habits-of-people-who-stay-calm-no-matter-what-life-throws-at-them/"&gt;sense of calm&lt;/a&gt; passing through the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation isn’t agreement. It’s respect. Strong personalities understand that difference, and that’s why they use this phrase so naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) “Tell me more.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those phrases that immediately shifts the entire direction of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tells the other person that you’re not planning your rebuttal, you’re not jumping to conclusions, and you’re not assuming you already know where the story is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says, “Tell me more,” they’re signaling curiosity instead of judgment. Curiosity lowers walls. Judgment builds them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities choose curiosity because they aren’t threatened by different perspectives, and they aren’t in a rush to control the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this phrase often when I’m trying to understand someone’s thought process, especially when I’m interviewing people or digging into a psychological concept I’m writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper you go into someone’s experience, the more clarity you get about what they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-have-a-rare-combination-of-high-intelligence-and-deep-intuition-usually-display-these-8-behaviors/"&gt;intuitively make space&lt;/a&gt; for that clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple phrase that makes people feel safe opening up. And in my experience, it’s one of the most generous ones you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) “You’re not alone in this.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren’t overwhelmed because they don’t have solutions. They’re overwhelmed because they think they’re carrying something alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/social-isolation-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; this “perceived social isolation,” and it’s powerful enough to make even ordinary challenges feel impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities tend to be the first to interrupt that belief. They know how heavy life can feel when you convince yourself you’re on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they say the words we don’t realize we’re desperate to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a close friend of mine was going through a brutal breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have anything insightful or wise to say at that moment, but I remember telling him, “You’re not alone in this. I’m here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t offering a solution. I was &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-8-phrases-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-when-they-notice-someone-is-quietly-struggling/"&gt;offering presence&lt;/a&gt;. And sometimes, presence is the very thing that lifts someone back onto their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase uplifts because it reminds us that carrying something together changes the weight of it. Strong people know that, and they offer their companionship freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) “You’ve handled tough things before.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often forget their own resilience. When stress hits, memory gets short, and we act like every challenge is the first one we’ve ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase gently reconnects someone to their own strength by pointing them back to their previous victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psychology, this ties into a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-efficacy-2795954" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially your belief in your ability to handle life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities speak to that belief directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They remind people of what they’ve already survived, knowing it will give them confidence to face what’s in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this one from a mentor early in my writing career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’d panic about a deadline, he’d say, “This isn’t your first climb.” For whatever reason, those words always centered me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-i-held-onto-resentment-for-years-then-i-learned-these-8-steps-to-truly-let-go/"&gt;shifted my focus from fear&lt;/a&gt; to capability, and I’ve used a version of that phrase in countless conversations since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities know that sometimes the most uplifting thing you can do is help someone remember who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this phrase does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) “It’s okay to take your time.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If modern life had a soundtrack, it would be a constant ticking clock. We’re always rushing, always &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-5-things-i-stopped-doing-that-made-me-happier-in-15-days-than-id-been-in-years/"&gt;comparing our timelines&lt;/a&gt;, always feeling like we’re behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities break that pattern for other people by reminding them that there’s no universal schedule for growth or healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase permits people to slow down without feeling guilty. It creates space where pressure used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is often the one thing someone needs to breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m out shooting photos, I catch myself rushing more than I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But funny enough, the best images I’ve ever taken came from slowing down and letting the moment settle. Life works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong people understand that not everything needs to be solved immediately, and not every chapter needs to be hurried through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying, “It’s okay to take your time,” they offer people a kind of emotional permission many of us rarely give ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hearing it can feel like someone loosening a knot in your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) “What do you need right now?”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of assuming the answer or diving into advice mode, people with strong personalities go straight to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask the person what they actually want or need in that moment. It seems obvious, but most of us forget to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-9-phrases-boomers-use-that-younger-generations-secretly-find-comforting/"&gt;encourages clarity&lt;/a&gt;, autonomy, and emotional honesty. It hands the power back to the person who might be feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And psychologically, it transforms the dynamic from “I know what’s best” to “You know what’s best, and I’m here to support that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to a reader recently who said this question changed the way she leaned on her friends during &lt;a href="https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, she didn’t know how to articulate what she needed until someone asked her directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when he did, the answer came easily. She needed rest. She needed quiet. She needed permission to step back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities help people uncover that truth instead of assuming it. This phrase is an invitation to self-awareness, and that alone can be deeply uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) “I believe in you.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase is simple, but it’s a psychological powerhouse. Humans tend to rise to the level of the expectations the people around them hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone with a strong personality says they believe in you, something inside you stands a little taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tied to the &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/pygmalion-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pygmalion effect&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that positive expectations from others can actually improve someone’s performance and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t magic. It’s social psychology. And it works more often than you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time an editor trusted me with a big feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I was ready, but he did, and I leaned into his belief until it became my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities use this phrase when it matters, not as empty flattery but as a &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-my-evenings-felt-aimless-and-restless-but-these-7-rituals-gave-me-structure-and-calm/"&gt;genuine reflection&lt;/a&gt; of what they see in someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often forget their strengths. A phrase like this can return them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities aren’t defined by volume, intensity, or force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re defined by the way they communicate calm, confidence, and compassion to the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven phrases uplift because they validate, reassure, and empower. They make people feel capable. They make people feel accompanied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they make people feel human in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can develop this type of strength. It starts with being intentional about the words we choose and the presence we bring into every conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

"Because we don't know where this infection originated, it's important that everyone in the Bingham school community be aware of symptoms and the possibility they were exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department warned that symptoms can usually appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash. So they advise anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms to contact their health care provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best form of protection against measles is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. It added that vaccinated people who do get measles tend to have milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications," the department noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

In hot climates, that combination can tip someone toward headaches, dizziness, darker urine, and higher heart rate-and creatine becomes an easy scapegoat instead of the overall hydration strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:48:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>音乐如何像大脑的食物- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/09/music-therapy-app-spiritune-brain-mental-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:37:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPdllTbjFGbVZLYzdrc0dzSjdVLVNMQTBBbWJWaXI3U29XaDlTUmNDZHJycDRXUmp5OGsyaTNPOF8tc29oN3Utem5RT2h0WjlacEFLX0JjUTZYU0tad1NqSWg4VFNRcFJZZEdoeDkzNjYzdlhINGh1d1VVMzZsVFRybFY2MnprUHc</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么麻疹疫情刚刚发生了危险的新转变- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/09/measles-outbreak-symptoms-elimination-status-outbreak</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:01:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOaWQyUlJLU09QemdlS0hqSmI2MWtsUUJpYmxpcHZJYTNCdFByczNaak5HMURWMnlqUWQyMFVlZnhfalpZcF80UzdqQjFLN055RkhKYXFtaHR2ankybElMajRpYzNXa3dfTXdzX1BuZFhrNTMzdzNZeUo2QWR0WVJCZGt0ZlhRenAzLWE3dDE3TQ</guid></item><item><title>研究声称，流行饮食可能会加速衰老- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-claims-that-popular-keto-diet-may-accelerate-aging/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strict form of the keto diet has been linked to faster cellular aging in males, while females on the same plan did not show the same damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference appears to come down to sex hormones and how they shape the way cells handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new work, male animals on a very high fat, very low carbohydrate diet built up damaged, nondividing cells in the heart and kidneys over just a few weeks, while females were largely spared the same burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments were run by a team at UT Health San Antonio, raising sharp questions about whether similar patterns could emerge in men who stay on keto diets for long stretches of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-diet-and-aging"&gt;Keto diet and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by David Gius, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology at &lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Health San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. His research focuses on how metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-keep-an-hourly-rhythm-shaping-mood-and-energy/"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt;, and stress inside cells shape aging and disease across different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the ketogenic diet, a very low carbohydrate, high fat way of eating, is designed to push the body away from sugar and toward fat as its main energy source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body’s primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat,” explained Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carb intake stays low enough, the liver produces ketones, small fuel molecules made from fat that can power the brain and other organs when glucose is scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully planned ketogenic programs are a long standing therapy for drug resistant epilepsy, and a pediatric hospital keto &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27373-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinic&lt;/a&gt; has reported large seizure reductions in many children without major growth problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-aging-and-keto-diets"&gt;Studying aging and keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one mouse &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725007971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, male animals fed a keto diet for several weeks showed a spike in markers of cellular aging called senescence, a state where stressed cells stop dividing but stay alive and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These senescent cells piled up in the heart and kidney, along with higher levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female mice on the same diet did not show the same surge in senescent cells or inflammatory signals over that time window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their heart and kidney tissue stayed closer to normal, even though their blood ketone levels confirmed they were in ketosis just like the males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male mice also showed strong signs of oxidative stress, an overload of reactive oxygen containing molecules that chip away at fats, proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-autism-to-neanderthal-dna-genetic-variants-found-in-modern-humans/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage markers such as oxidized lipids and modified proteins climbed in male organs on keto, while female tissues again remained largely unchanged under the same feeding plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older female mice with naturally lower estrogen levels began to look more like the males when they were placed on a ketogenic diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed more senescent cells and oxidative damage, linking the protection seen in younger females to hormone status rather than sex alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-oxidative-stress-and-aging-cells"&gt;Hormones, oxidative stress, and aging cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea directly, the team treated some male mice with estrogen, a major female sex hormone that also influences metabolism and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those males no longer showed the keto driven rise in senescent cells or oxidative damage, suggesting that estrogen was actively buffering their tissues against stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective role fits with broader research showing that estrogen can tune up the cell’s own defense systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, estrogen replacement &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to switch on antioxidant and longevity related genes and to lower several measures of oxidative stress, supporting the idea that hormone status changes how tissues weather metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tried a different route, giving male mice classic antioxidants, compounds that neutralize reactive oxygen molecules before they harm cell structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, and a drug that mimics the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD, all cut back the buildup of senescent cells and oxidative damage in keto fed males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those antioxidant treatments also brought inflammatory blood markers down toward normal in the male mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the hormone and antioxidant experiments suggest that the diet itself creates extra oxidative pressure, but hormones and chemical defenses can either blunt or amplify the impact on aging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-in-real-people-risks-and-uses"&gt;Keto in real people, risks and uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal work like this does not translate directly to humans, which the researchers themselves stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://dom.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, human data already show that keto style patterns are not neutral for the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a randomized feeding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy young women following a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat diet developed very high LDL cholesterol levels compared with when they ate a more conventional non keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broad cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280624000410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; concludes that low carbohydrate patterns can bring quick drops in weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar, yet they do not outperform other eating styles for long term cardiovascular outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review also flags safety questions, including nutrient gaps, kidney strain, and possible effects on arterial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate work in male mice found that long periods of keto feeding led to fat buildup in the liver and worse glucose control, changes that eased after switching back to standard chow in one &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1290540/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mixed findings underline that keto is a strong &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-extracts-may-help-treat-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic &lt;/a&gt;tool, not a harmless shortcut, and responses can vary across bodies and over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-lessons-from-keto-diets"&gt;Aging lessons from keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mouse work suggests that deep carb restriction might speed the accumulation of senescent cells in some tissues, at least in male animals with typical hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of cellular aging is linked in other research to stiffer hearts, weaker kidneys, and chronic low grade inflammation as organisms grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, ketogenic therapy remains a vital option for some people with severe epilepsy when other drugs fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” said Routhenstein, who emphasized the need for professional guidance when such a restrictive diet is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people drawn to keto mainly for weight loss or short term glucose control, the picture is more unsettled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings add sex and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; status to a growing list of factors that likely shape who does well, who runs into trouble, and how long such a diet should reasonably continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this research, one message stands out clearly: very low carbohydrate, very high fat diets act as powerful metabolic stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering them as a lifestyle choice, rather than a time limited medical therapy, needs careful medical supervision, regular lab checks, and an honest look at whether less extreme changes could meet their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00797-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007971%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Arizona are sounding the alarm on how changing weather patterns are affecting the transmission of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/azpmnews/2025/10/31/227085-arizona-researchers-track-how-climate-change-is-fueling-mosquito-activity-and-disease-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;AZPM&lt;/a&gt;, NPR's Southern Arizona affiliate, scientists are concerned about the relationship between warming global temperatures and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/unexpected-mosquito-surge-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-transmitted diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The region has seen two confirmed human cases of &lt;a href="https://www.pima.gov/2720/Newsroom?contentId=0e3f1793-94e6-4ffe-bc70-7f7527646ee7" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; in 2025&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diseases like West Nile virus are known as "&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;vector-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;," a class of diseases that infect humans through the bites of arthropods like fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can not only infect humans, but they can also pick up the disease of an already infected human with their bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-the-relationship-between-a-warmer-planet-and-vector-borne-illnesses-concerning"&gt;Why is the relationship between a warmer planet and vector-borne illnesses concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the American Southwest, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" target="_blank"&gt;rising temperatures&lt;/a&gt; mean that summer heat waves are more extreme than ever, which speeds up the mosquito lifecycle, expands their reach and longevity, and increases their numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-4261581203" data-theco-trackid="446882" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more intense monsoon seasons are ideal for mosquito breeding, as they need to lay their eggs in water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/quinx-mosquito-spread-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank"&gt;The bug's ability to adapt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/mosquitoes-adapting-rising-temperatures/" target="_blank"&gt;changing climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; also concerns scientists, as it makes prevention methods a more temporary solution, with the need to update practices over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The new places that become better for mosquitoes outweigh the places that are currently experiencing and might experience less due to high temperatures," explained Heidi Brown, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/psr/yearinreview2021" target="_blank"&gt;In 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Pima County in Arizona saw over 100 cases of West Nile virus during a year littered with particularly hot weather and a violent monsoon season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As global temperatures rise and extreme weather becomes stronger, longer, and more frequent &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/steroids-extreme-weather-climate-change-storms/" target="_blank"&gt;as a result&lt;/a&gt;, the region will likely see more years of elevated case counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the things that's fascinating to me as a scientist," Brown said. "These diseases shouldn't exist, right? It just seems completely improbable, and yet it's not. It's a very big problem globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-to-mitigate-disease-transmission-by-mosquitoes"&gt;What's being done to mitigate disease transmission by mosquitoes?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Southern Arizona, one of the methods to manage vector-borne diseases is a more indirect approach that addresses other concerns in the area. Municipalities are experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/red-oak-rain-garden-university-illinois/" target="_blank"&gt;green stormwater infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to recycle much-needed water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method not only benefits the water supply but also helps reduce the amount of standing water that makes for ideal mosquito breeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The reason that we care about green stormwater infrastructure is because adding nature back into the urban environment provides all of these benefits in the urban environment that we really need, like cooling, shade, air quality improvement," said Blue Baldwin, program manager for the City of Tucson's climate action initiative Storm to Shade, per AZPM.&lt;/p&gt;

An official with the Moulton-Udell School District, in Appanoose County, told KCCI about 30% of students and staff are out — many with influenza A. "We will use this time to fully sanitize our facilities and provide a needed health reset for our students, staff, and families," the school posted on its Facebook page. Athletic events and other activities are also canceled.Last month, following the state's first flu-related death of the season, KCCI spoke to several medical professionals about how to stay healthy this winter. State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse issued a statement urging Iowans to talk with their doctors about getting the flu shot and reminding anyone who is ill — or whose children are ill — to stay home. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services also recommends that Iowans:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.» Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;U.S. health officials have issued travel advisories for Americans planning trips to certain tropical countries amid outbreaks of an untreatable mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that it has issued Level 2 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/cuba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;travel advisories for Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Guangdong Province in southern China, advising Americans to "practice enhanced precautions" when visiting these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say there are currently no treatments for chikungunya, but the disease is vaccine-preventable, and vaccination is recommended for travelers to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of the virus include fever and joint pain, though patients may also experience headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or a rash, according to health officials. Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR, AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

established to help support the family — particularly her mother, Terese, who had to take time off work to stay with her daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fundraiser explained, Joyce had been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder, which “left her immune system compromised, her organs with extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid.” The once active teen — she was a member of the Ohio State Club Dance Team and active in her parish’s youth ministry program — was left bedridden due to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, died from a rare disorder caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin has been contained to 4 tiny walls in a hospital room for many weeks now as doctors try to understand more about her rare condition. This has come with daily blood draws, blood transfusions, bone marrow tests and so many more treatments that I can’t even remember the names of,” the GoFundMe explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin is unable to do simple tasks that many healthy individuals take for granted. Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin cannot partake in. She fatigues quickly making it hard for her to walk short distances. Things like living in the dorms, dining in dining halls, going to OSU football games, going to in person classes, going to Mass [at] the Newman Center and even dancing are all things she hasn’t been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus often won’t cause symptoms, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23469-epstein-barr-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains. When it does present with symptoms, it’s most often as &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/florida-teen-dies-after-contracting-mononucleosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mononucleosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mononucleosis&lt;/a&gt; (which causes fever and fatigue) in young adults and children. Although it wasn’t specified which blood disorder Joyce developed, EBV can cause a handful of rare — but lethal — conditions, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5770746/#S6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic active Epstein–Barr virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic active Epstein–Barr virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is when the infection is unable to be controlled, or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557776/#:~:text=Pathophysiology,resulting%20in%20target%20cell%20degradation." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,&lt;/a&gt; which is a “a devastating, hyperinflammatory condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 4, the fundraiser announced that “in the past twenty-four hours, Cailin’s condition took a sudden and significant turn for the worse, and despite the extraordinary care she received and the many prayers lifted for her healing, she passed away peacefully, surrounded by love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cailin Joyce/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her teammates on the Ohio State Club Dance Team wrote a post on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR-IZUOjgHe/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in her honor, remembering her as “kind, humble, determined, loyal and oh so funny.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97% of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals who do get measles tend to experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms should call their healthcare provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus," the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jordan School District sent the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jordan School District is working closely with the Salt Lake County Health Department to address a confirmed measles case associated with Bingham High School’s Daycare Program. A guidance letter from Salt Lake County Health has been sent to the school community informing families of the situation.

Apart from the experimental medicine, the only option left was to make their death more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I really did think that I was going to die and I wouldn't be able to grow up and do all the things that every child deserves to be able to do," says 16-year-old Alyssa Tapley from Leicester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She was the first person in the world to have the treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital and is now enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Alyssa is now enjoying life&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The revolutionary treatment three years ago involved wiping out her old immune system and growing a new one.

Alyssa is doing her A-levels, the Duke of Edinburgh Award, eyeing up driving lessons and planning her future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm looking into doing an apprenticeship in biomedical science, and hopefully one day I'll go into blood cancer research as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The team at University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital used a technology called base editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it from one type to another and rewriting the instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Researchers wanted to harness the natural power of healthy T-cells to seek out and destroy threats and turn that against the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is a tricky feat. They had to engineer the good T-cells to hunt the bad ones without the treatment annihilating itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They started with healthy T-cells from a donor and set about modifying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The first base edit disabled the T-cells' targeting mechanism so they could not attack the patient's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The second removed a chemical marking, called CD7, which is on all T-cells. Removing it is essential for preventing the therapy from self-destructing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The third edit was an "invisibility cloak" that prevented the cells being killed by a chemotherapy drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now the modified T-cells would destroy every other T-cell they found whether they were cancerous or healthy, but they would not attack each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The therapy is infused into patients and if their cancer cannot be detected after four weeks, then patients have a bone marrow transplant to regrow their immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A few years ago, this would have been science fiction," says Prof Waseem Qasim from UCL and Great Ormond Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to basically dismantle the entire immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's a deep, intensive treatment, it's very demanding on the patients, but when it works, it's worked very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reports the results of the first 11 patients treated across Great Ormond Street and King's College Hospital.

Here are three common myths, and the reality behind them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="7r8ob-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7r8ob-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7r8ob-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One line I hear constantly in the clinic is, “I do fine on five hours of sleep.” The problem is that your body is not convinced. Large studies show a U shaped link between sleep duration and mortality. Too little sleep, less than six hours, and very long sleep, more than nine hours, are both associated with higher risks of heart disease, diabetes and even premature death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="d725b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d725b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d725b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In recent years, researchers have also found that sleep regularity matters no less than sleep quantity. One study of more than 60,000 participants found that inconsistent bed and wake times predicted early death more strongly than the number of hours slept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="b8ri1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="djegf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="djegf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="djegf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep most nights. Try to go to bed and wake up at similar times, even on weekends. Get daylight exposure in the morning and cut back on screens before bed. Both help reset the body’s clock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Bottom line: Sleep is not “wasting time.” It is one of the best investments you can make in a longer, healthier life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For many people, exercise is all or nothing.

But the data tell a very different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Meta analyses and large scale studies show that even meeting the modest guideline of about 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, significantly lowers mortality risk, and the benefit holds at almost any age. Recent studies also broke another major myth. You do not need 10,000 steps a day. Among older women, even 4,000 steps a day, one or two times a week, were linked to a 25% to 40% drop in risk of death from any cause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;And it is not only about volume. Another study found that short bursts of activity, even one minute of intense effort, like taking stairs or running for the bus, repeated a few times a day, were tied to a meaningful reduction in mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Bottom line: You do not need a marathon.

In research, the picture is much steadier. A Mediterranean eating pattern rich in vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish and olive oil, and low in ultra processed foods, is consistently linked to lower overall mortality and lower death rates from heart disease, cancer and degenerative illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Large studies tracking women for up to 25 years found that those who adhered more closely to a Mediterranean pattern had a lower risk of death from any cause. When that diet is combined with moderate weight loss and physical activity, a large Spanish study showed a 31% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among people already at risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="3nhs5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3nhs5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3nhs5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Bottom line: It matters less whether you call yourself “vegan,” “keto,” or “intermittent fasting.” It matters more how many vegetables, fibers, healthy fats and minimally processed foods are on your plate over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="1eo8o-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="d9h4a-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d9h4a-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d9h4a-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;If you ask science rather than clickbait headlines, the answer is simple and a little disappointing: the combination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="sogk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="sogk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="sogk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;There are hints that physical activity may be the single most powerful element. A massive study of more than two million adults found that following recommended activity levels reduced mortality risk more than most other modifiable factors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="24jo4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="24jo4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="24jo4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;But without regular sleep, the body recovers less well from effort.

already agree that beta-blockers are crucial when the heart’s pumping strength is clearly reduced, measured as a “low left ventricular ejection fraction.” This refers to the share of blood pumped out with each beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people whose pumping strength looks normal, with no heart failure or rhythm problems, several expert groups have questioned whether staying on the drug for years really adds much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-new-trial-tested"&gt;What the new trial tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the BETAMI and DANBLOCK &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, researchers enrolled adults who had recently survived a myocardial infarction in hospitals across Norway and Denmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every participant had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; of at least 40 percent and no signs of heart failure, which meant their hearts were still pumping reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first couple of weeks after the heart attack, about half the patients were randomly assigned to long term beta-blocker treatment and the rest to no beta-blocker at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events like death, new heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, unplanned procedures to reopen arteries, and dangerous rhythms were tracked for a median of 3.5 years and compared using a hazard ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking a beta-blocker had fewer events of death or serious cardiovascular complications than those who did not, with a hazard ratio of 0.85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 95 percent confidence interval, from 0.75 to 0.98, indicates that this difference is unlikely to be due to chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-team-found"&gt;What the team found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers broke the outcome into pieces, they saw that new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attacks occurred in 5.0 percent of patients on beta-blockers, compared with 6.7 percent in those not taking them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of stroke, heart failure, unplanned coronary procedures, and serious rhythm disturbances stayed very low and quite similar between the two groups, and deaths from any cause were rare in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the trial did not reveal any major safety problems with long term use in this selected group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious side effects strong enough to make patients stop the medicine were uncommon, which provides some reassurance for people already taking these drugs after a recent heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-beta-blockers-matter"&gt;Why beta-blockers matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who leave the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hospital-food-puts-patients-at-risk-and-the-planet/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; with a heart that still pumps fairly well, doctors have struggled with whether a beta-blocker really improves survival or simply adds extra pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial suggests that, at least for people with preserved or mildly reduced pumping function and no arrhythmia, an abnormal or irregular heart rhythm, the treatment can lower the chance of another major event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit is modest rather than dramatic, so the decision to continue or start a beta-blocker still needs to balance possible tiredness, low blood pressure, or cold hands against the reduction in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many younger or higher risk patients, especially those with mildly weakened heart pumping, that tradeoff may still come out in favor of staying on the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-still-remain"&gt;Questions still remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At almost the same time, another large &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2512686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a study that combines data from several clinical trials, reported that beta-blockers did not improve survival or prevent new heart attacks in patients whose ejection fraction was at least 50 percent after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work pooled individual patient data from five randomized studies and painted a more skeptical picture for people whose hearts appear completely normal on pumping tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01592-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; focused only on people with mildly reduced ejection fraction between 40 and 49 percent found clear benefit from beta-blockers in preventing repeat heart attacks and heart failure episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern, where patients with slightly weakened hearts gain the most, is supported by pooled data from European and Japanese trials that were reanalyzed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these mixed results explain why many guideline committees have not rushed to make sweeping changes for patients with normal heart function after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will probably focus on teasing apart which subgroups, defined by age, sex, heart pumping strength, and other illnesses, truly gain enough from beta-blockers to justify long term treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone recovering from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack, the practical message is simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication decisions should never be changed on their own, and the best next step is a detailed conversation with a treating cardiologist who can weigh personal risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985?query=featured_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By DAMIEN FISHER, InDepthNH.org&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire parents will still be able to get their newborns life-saving vaccines against hepatitis B despite U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s efforts to curb the practice, according to a memo the New Hampshire Health Alert sent to medical providers Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Alert, part of the NH Department of Health and Human Services, wasn’t sent to the general public reiterating the medical value of the hepatitis B vaccine as the state continues to recommend the shots despite federal changes.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Last week, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who made millions for his anti-vaccine advocacy, replaced the public health officials on the ACIP this summer with people who share his discredited theories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the Alert to medical providers Friday, Maddie Miller, Public Health Public Information Officer, responded Monday: “Please see the statement below, attributed to State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is aware of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) vote to no longer universally recommend the hepatitis B vaccine for all infants and children. DHHS and leading expert medical organizations, such as the &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/immunization-schedules/birth-through-age-18-immunization-schedule.html?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, continue to recommend hepatitis B vaccination for all children, with the first dose given within 24 hours after birth, as the best way to protect kids against hepatitis B and the lifelong health problems it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The Department will continue to monitor the impacts of the ACIP decision to ensure New Hampshire families that want the hepatitis B vaccine have access to it. DHHS encourages anyone with questions about any vaccine to speak to a trusted healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked why the public wasn’t told, she didn’t immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is an incurable disease that can result in liver cancer, cirrhosis, and early death. About half the people with hepatitis B do not know they have it, and the disease is passed on by coming into contact with fluids like blood, saliva. The virus can live on a surface for up to a week, and unvaccinated children who come into contact with that surface can then be infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children are susceptible to contracting the disease playing sports, in daycare settings, or from a parent who has an undiagnosed case. About 25 percent of children who contract the disease will die from it. Before infant vaccinations became common 30 years ago, there were 18,000 children infected every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of the childhood cases are the result of mother-to-child transmission, but that transmission can be stopped by giving the vaccine to newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a cut, that blood could potentially get on the infant,” Anita Patel, a  pediatrician and pediatric critical care physician in Washington, D.C. told the Associated Press. “And if that infant has any sort of break in their skin — as infants, frankly, frequently do — they can then get hepatitis B.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy “retired” the 17 medical and technical experts on the ACIP soon after he took office. The new members, announced in June, include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses. She has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation, according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another new ACIP member is Dr. Robert Malone, a former mRNA researcher who trades in conspiracy theories about the COVID pandemic, and who supports so-called alternative treatments for COVID and measles. Malone has stated people were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and he’s suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS, according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was paid $20,000 a week for chairing the Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit that raises millions to support lawsuits against vaccine makers. According to Reuters, CHD brought 30 federal and state lawsuits since 2020, many challenging vaccines and public health mandates. Kennedy also earned millions as a consultant for law firms bringing those lawsuits, according to Politifact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Health Alert Network messages are sent through New Hampshire’s primary communication alerting system which rapidly pushes out health alerts via telephone, text message, fax, e-mail and pager. Participants include physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, hospital emergency departments, local health departments, local public health responders, public health volunteers, health officers, etc.,” according to the network’s website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enrollment in the NH-HAN is open to individuals who meet at least one of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recipient has a legal obligation to respond to a public health incident.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A public health incident is occurring in the recipient’s jurisdictional area.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipient’s participation is essential for completing a public health intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cost of complying with current regulations for removing Pfas in drinking water is estimated at about $3.8bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are trying to put numbers on this and that’s important because when you want to clean up and regulate Pfas, there’s a real cost to it,” Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are widely used across the economy, and industrial sites that utilize them in high volume often pollute groundwater. Military bases and airports are among major sources of Pfas pollution because the chemicals are used in firefighting foam. The federal government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/pfas-contaminating-drinking-water" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that about 95 million people across the country drink contaminated water from public or private wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/05/pfas-sperm-count-mobility-testicle-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raised concern&lt;/a&gt; about the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/forever-chemicals-found-umbilical-cord-blood-samples-studies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas exposure&lt;/a&gt; on fetuses and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among those are toxicological studies in which researchers examine the chemicals’ impact on lab animals, but that leaves some question about whether humans experience the same harms, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other studies are correlative and look at the levels of Pfas in umbilical cord blood or in newborns in relation to levels of disease. Lemoine said those findings are not always conclusive, in part because many variables can contribute to reproductive harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new natural study is unique because it gets close to “isolating the effect of the Pfas itself, and not anything around it”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers achieved this by identifying 41 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; sites contaminated with Pfoa and Pfos, two common Pfas compounds, then using topography data to determine groundwater flow direction. The authors then examined reproductive outcomes among residents down gradient from the sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers chose New Hampshire because it is the only state where Pfas and reproductive data is available, Lemoine said. Well locations are confidential, so mothers were unaware of whether their water source was down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site. That created a randomization that allows for causal inference, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study’s methodology is rigorous and unique, and underscores “that Pfas is no joke, and is toxic at very low concentrations”, said Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst with the Environmental Working Group non-profit. The group studies Pfas exposures and advocates for tighter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is in part effective because mothers did not know whether they were exposed, which created the randomization, Evans said, but she noted that the state has the information. The findings raise questions about whether the state should be doing a similar analysis and alerting mothers who are at risk, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemoine said the study had some limitations, including that authors don’t know the mothers’ exact exposure levels to Pfas, nor does the research account for other contaminants that may be in the water. But he added that the findings still give a strong picture of the chemicals’ effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Granular activated carbon or reverse osmosis systems can be used by water treatment plants and consumers at home to remove many kinds of Pfas, and those systems &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.5c00519" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also remove other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Biden administration last year put in place limits in drinking water for six types of Pfas, and gave water utilities several years to install systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration is moving to undo the limits for some compounds. That would probably cost the public more in the long run. Utility customers pay the cost of removing Pfas, but the public “also pays the cost of drinking contaminated water, which is bigger”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 20:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOZTNyX3lvWmtjamNOTXhFLTMxZ3gtMjZQOEdRUGticlJ2dG9obVpueDVVdHh2Mzl3Ui1vZXBOOU9wc1c3RFNaVzBWenc3TDVrZ1o1YzZFZ0w4dlBvX05sUGF1ZXQxTnJ6YmM3OE1OX0RRQ1BnRk5VSlZueDIxZmNIT2RnQmFmX2VRSFhIME5WbUc1dFZn</guid></item><item><title>随着年龄的增长，您的手机实际上对您有好处吗？新研究表明是的，但只有在特定年龄之后- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/phone-actually-good-older-study-180000047.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Your Phone May End Up Being Good For Your Brain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Oscar Wong - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recent study found that adults over 50 who used phones, computers, and tablets had a 42 percent lower risk of cognitive impairment and a 74 percent lower rate of cognitive decline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This could be because phones provide a cognitive challenge and social connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This doesn’t mean that all screen use is helpful, and more research is needed to determine the type and duration that's best—and whether this benefit would carry over to younger adults or children, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F12%2F01%2Fwell%2Ffamily%2Fearly-smartphone-ownership-study.html&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69622553%2Fphone-usage-brain-health-age%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the reports;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the reports&lt;/a&gt; that suggest smartphones are not so great for your health.

The average age of study participants was 69 and all of them had undergone a cognitive test or had a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that there was no evidence to suggest that using phones raises the risk of cognitive decline. But they did find a link between using a computer, phone, or tablet and a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, people who used phones, computers, and tablets had a 42 percent lower risk of cognitive impairment and a 74 percent lower rate of cognitive decline compared to those who used them less or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might using phones over 50 be good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t dive into that—it simply found a link between phone use in older adults and a lower risk of cognitive issues. But there are a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most likely explanation is that technically challenging tasks require learning,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “One of the most significant strategies to reducing the risk of late life cognitive decline is the robustness of use of the brain in early and midlife.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology also requires using your brain in different ways, points out &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Using technology requires [the use of multiple senses] from looking at the screen, understanding what is being shown or reading what is on the screen, processing this in your brain and then using eye-hand coordination to respond to what you are watching or doing,” he says. “Using technology is a daily cognitive exercise and losing the ability to use your phone or email is similar to losing the ability to drive or care for your finances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of distractions that pop up on devices, including notifications and advertisements, says &lt;a href="https://psychologyneuroscience.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/michael-k-scullin-phd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Scullin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Scullin&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author and professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University. “Trying to get rid of those distractions and focus is a cognitive challenge that doesn’t necessarily occur if you’re sitting in a quiet room with a newspaper,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a social element here, too, through things like video calls and texting, according to Scullin. “Loneliness and social isolation are predictors of faster cognitive decline in older adults,” he says. “Phones can provide greater social connection and decrease isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to consider: Scullin notes that phones can act as “cognitive aids” to help older adults remember things, like doctor’s appointments and birthdays. That can reinforce things like social connections (like when you don’t miss someone’s birthday or event) and support good overall health, all of which can be good for your brain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean that all screen use is helpful. “There is also potential for these devices to be very passive,” Scullin says. “If all you’re doing is binge-watching videos, that might not be a very cognitively stimulating activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do younger people benefit, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly, but that’s still being explored. “It probably depends on how they use their phone,” Scullin says. “Are they watching things or engaging?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Scullin says that more work is needed to see how adults—especially older adults—may benefit from phone use. "The findings suggest that devices are not always good or bad,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 19:10:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNTmp3RE56TmFnOW5Nem1qUUNLZmZ5TzNlUjF0M0t5bmFSMU1pZlExRTBXNEFGcXU1R2VzYldEaVNqdHo1SE5SU2ZTeG9EREFuRHgwdE95UUpNNEJobmhiU21nOEEzZ2stLXh0Y2I0XzFSV3JBcmdmSXhkejV5TGZSUw</guid></item><item><title>饮用苏打水时肠道会发生什么- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-gut-seltzer-11864278</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seltzer can help you stay hydrated, which supports smooth and regular digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bubbles may cause bloating or reflux, especially for people with sensitive stomachs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing the right type—and drinking it slowly—can make seltzer easier on your gut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With zero sodium, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat or sugar, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937834/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-drink-seltzer-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;seltzer&lt;/a&gt; seems like the beverage that can do no wrong. Whether we like it plain, infused with flavors or sparkling with festive fizz, it’s become a favorite for many. But those bubbles come with one lingering question: Is seltzer actually good for your gut, or could it be causing more trouble than you expect?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To answer that, it helps to understand what happens inside your digestive tract when you sip something carbonated. The bubbles we love are simply carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in water. Once that CO2 hits the warmer environment of your stomach, it turns into gas that needs somewhere to go, and there are two routes it can take. For some people, beyond the noise, that’s no big deal. For others, especially those with sensitive gastrointestinal tracts, those bubbles can bring bloating, pain or discomfort that’s hard to ignore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what the latest science says about how seltzer affects your gut, along with insights from nutrition experts and simple strategies for enjoying the fizz without the unwanted side effects.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of us don’t drink enough water, and seltzer can help bridge that gap. If bubbles make plain water more appealing, that can translate to better overall hydration, and better hydration helps promote optimal digestion.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Seltzer comes in a variety of flavors, so this sparkling beverage pairs perfectly with a meal instead of a high-added-sugar beverage. Plus, it can take center stage in a tasty mocktail. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD, points out, “Seltzer hydrates just like regular water, and staying well-hydrated is one of the best things you can do for smooth digestion and regularity.” Blatner highlights, “If the fizz or flavor makes water feel exciting, seltzer can be a fun add-in to your plain water rotation to help you drink more overall. However, if someone notices digestive symptoms from drinking seltzer, they should ditch the bubbles and switch to the still stuff.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beyond hydration,” Keri Gans, RDN, says, “carbonation itself doesn’t offer specific gut perks—the real benefit is simply meeting your fluid needs.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Buyer beware, however, since some seltzers also come with added sugar, caffeine or other additives you may not have counted for in this clear beverage. Moreover, not all seltzers are calorie-free, so be sure to read labels carefully to understand what you’re buying. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carbonation can create a gentle stretching in the stomach, which may help you feel full a little sooner,” says Gans. “It’s not a magic trick for weight control, but for some people it can take the edge off hunger between meals,” Gans points out. Studies have suggested that carbonation might slightly enhance satiety, which could be helpful if you’re trying to lose weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your choice is between soda and seltzer, your gut wins with selecting seltzer. You’ll avoid added sugars, no- or low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols and acids that can irritate digestion for some people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even though seltzer is carbonated, some people notice improvements in bloating or general GI discomfort transitioning from high-sugar or high-acid beverages to sparkling water.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Cause or Worsen Bloating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When carbon dioxide reaches the stomach, it creates gas, and for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) or sensitive digestion, that can feel uncomfortable. Seltzer doesn’t &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; these issues, but it can amplify symptoms if you’re prone to them. One study found drinking carbonated beverages was associated with almost three times more reported IBS symptoms compared to people not drinking carbonated beverages.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tara Collingwood, M.S., RDN, CSSD, LD/N, ACSM-CPT, says, “Once seltzer (water infused with carbon dioxide gas) reaches the stomach, some of that gas is released, which can create a feeling of fullness or the urge to burp.” Collingwood assures us, “It doesn’t harm the digestive tract. It’s really just some extra gas your body has to manage.  The water part is absorbed the same way regular water is.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Might Trigger Reflux &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those bubbles can increase pressure in the stomach, and that extra pressure may relax the lower esophageal sphincter, making reflux more likely. Not everyone reacts this way, but if you’ve noticed heartburn after drinking seltzer, the carbonation might not bring the benefits you’re looking for.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although sugar-sweetened and citrusy beverages have been found to exacerbate symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, Blatner says, “Because carbonation can also be the culprit, it’s likely that any variation of sparkling water will impact the gut similarly for those who are sensitive.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Might Impact Tooth Enamel &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbonation makes water slightly acidic, and if you’re reaching for seltzer often, particularly the flavored versions, your enamel may become more sensitive over time. A recent review found that frequent exposure to carbonated drinks increases the risk of enamel erosion—even when there’s no sugar involved. Blatner suggests drinking seltzer with food or simply rinsing your mouth with regular water afterward.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cold Seltzer Can Slow Digestion Slightly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies suggest that very cold drinks may delay gastric emptying, which can contribute to fullness. These findings demonstrate that consuming cold beverages may reduce energy intake, but if your stomach is feeling sensitive, carbonation can still create discomfort.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Flavored Seltzers May Be More Irritating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mineral waters that naturally contain magnesium or calcium can be mildly helpful for staying regular. Collingwood states, “Flavored seltzers without added sugar or sweeteners are generally fine, but those containing artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols can trigger bloating or diarrhea in some sensitive people.” Collingwood went on to say, “More acidic or citrusy seltzers can potentially make reflux worse for people with GERD.” Acidic water won’t hurt your gut microbiome, but it can irritate stomach lining or contribute to discomfort for some people.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pair it with food so gas isn’t hitting an empty stomach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sip slowly instead of chugging, which traps more air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t drink seltzer through a straw, since that might exacerbate discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose plain or “no-acid-added” varieties if you’re sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let it sit for a few minutes to allow some bubbles to dissipate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick to room-temperature seltzer if cold beverages bother your gut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rotate with still water if you’re prone to bloating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test your tolerance—everyone’s gut responds differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid drinking it right before exercise if it makes you feel overly full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure to read beverage labels to see what you’re getting besides water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, seltzer is perfectly fine for most people and, for many, it may even support healthier hydration habits. The key is knowing how your body reacts. If you find yourself feeling bloated or have reflux symptoms after drinking it, consider limiting carbonated beverages or trying different temperatures or flavors. But if your gut feels great and you enjoy the bubbles, keep sipping. Blatner sums it up by saying, “Seltzer may aggravate gastrointestinal symptoms, but it’s not necessarily true for everyone, so you have to listen to your body.”&lt;br&gt;

The scientists mantain that identifying this genetic risk factor opens up the possibility of designing preventive therapies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The GRIN2A gene regulates communication between neurons by producing the GluN2A protein. When functioning optimally, it promotes the transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells and facilitates essential processes such as learning, memory, language, and brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In their article, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03279-4"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the researchers demonstrated that the gene mutation reduces the activity of the NMDA electrical receptor, which aids in neuronal communication, thereby increasing the risk of developing mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Of the 121 individuals studied, 85 had a GRIN2A variant and 23 of them developed a mental illness. These results show that carriers of the mutation have a significantly higher risk than those without variations. Furthermore, the patients exhibited strictly psychiatric symptoms, which largely rules out environmental or contextual explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The finding contradicts the general consensus on the polygenic origin of mental disorders. Until now, clinicians have considered that these diseases arise from the interaction of multiple factors, including genetic ones. This study demonstrates for the first time that a mutation in a single gene can decisively influence the development of a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The report also cites previous research that treated NMDA receptor deficiency, caused by the GRIN2A mutation, with L-serine, an amino acid. The four schizophrenia patients who participated in the trial showed remarkable improvements: disappearance of hallucinations, remission of paranoia symptoms, and improved behavior after receiving the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As this trial was conducted prior to the main study, the authors clarify that it cannot yet be considered a definitive therapeutic method. However, they point out that the efficacy of L-serine can be confirmed in a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Schizophrenia Remains a Huge Enigma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental illness that manifests itself with delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and language, behavioral changes, and loss of motivation or pleasure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disorder affects some 23 million people worldwide, equivalent to 0.29 percent of the global population. In adults, the rate rises to 0.43 percent, meaning that 1 in every 233 people develops it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Specialists now have a good understanding of its symptoms and have identified the age ranges in which it typically appears. Effective therapies exist, and several risk factors are recognized, including genetics, neurochemistry, and external elements such as stress or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Even so, science has not identified a single cause or fully explained the variability among those at risk. Some people develop the illness and others do not, even if both parents have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is also no clear strategy for preventing its onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story first appeared in &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/por-primera-vez-en-la-historia-encuentran-un-gen-vinculado-directamente-con-una-enfermedad-mental"&gt;WIRED en Español&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, monitoring sites in Wheaton and Glen Ellyn are tracking the virus. Wheaton saw a large increase in cases the week of Nov. 10, while Glen Ellyn saw a spike just before Thanksgiving. But the holidays could bring even more cases; last year, cases of norovirus spiked massively in both cities in early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 reported norovirus outbreaks a year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. Some health experts worry that the variant GII.17, which was responsible for last year’s spike, may have mutated and become more contagious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GII.4 strain dominated norovirus outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; for more than 30 years, but last year, the GII.17 mutation was responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;75 percent of outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; there are two possibilities: Either the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or changes in the population made more people susceptible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And probably it’s a combination of both,” Atmar said. “But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the GII.17 strain include forceful vomiting, intense diarrhea and stomach cramps that are especially hard on children under 5, adults over 85, and those with underlying health conditions, according to the CDC. Dehydration is a primary risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because GII.17 is a new strain, people have less built-up immunity and may experience more severe illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When new strains emerge, people are exposed to a strain that they have not previously been exposed to, and hence are more likely to get infected,” Lee-Ann Jaykus, a professor in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University, &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/winter-vomiting-disease-surges-ahead-of-schedule-norovirus-11154741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Historically, new strains emerge every seven to 10 years, and we were due for one, so this is not surprising,” Jaykus said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vigorous hand-washing with hot water and soap and other good hygiene practices are crucial to limit the spread of norovirus. It spreads easily, either through direct contact with someone who is sick, eating food or drinking liquids contaminated with the virus, touching contaminated surfaces, and poor hand-washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 18:06:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQZG5ud0JYdHJ4UDBRWFI1MFVZZlprUEg1eWpOTmFQd2lBcWYzbG0yM1BVVmRqMWJ2bFpTblpHRGhldExrWkF3Yzd3TEJiQXBfNkVwVjNteUJPQUV0RE5WM3NIM2NkbW9sQy1pMm1qMzRESmJzOGxfdUZFTlBRNXc0YmdGbV9Ra2lXRmFUZVN5SjNzOEdTYmtfVGt1UdIBtAFBVV95cUxNbmVGV0IwNHNhcUFUYWhfZXgzWm0wS1dUYXliRHhvUVlVbzI5R1oteWxFS2wzck5Hc3R6OHdXc2hJTk5xUHY0QlpRdTlYaEE5MjhzNnBoQjVCcnVSeVlQQlZNNEJMMUVvdHhWSGh4dHhWSzVxSFYtdTNSOXQySEZOOEYzNmFveFBuX0k1QjZUNDhPVmdCM2xsSVhIeFQtUm9SMkttdEE4VFdmYjNwdFF2UTZOV3M</guid></item><item><title>当日汤品：冬季每晚喝鸡汤的5个理由-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/soup-of-the-day-5-reasons-to-drink-chicken-soup-every-night-in-winter/articleshow/125842051.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steaming hot, filled with spices and crunchy with chicken, a bowl of chicken soup ticks all the boxes on your taste buds and has you craving one sip after another. Bad day at work, fight with a friend or under the weather, there's not one problem chicken soup can't fix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has a lot to do with nostalgia and comfort, with the taste of the dish, it is also related to its numerous health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chicken soup: America's favourite soup&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America, chicken soup is typically made with noodles, it's chicken noodle soup! While the origin of the delicious dish can be traced back to ancient China, chicken soup came to be considered as food for therapy back in the 60 AD. Pedanius Dioscorides, an army surgeon who served under the Roman emperor Nero, had a five-volume encyclopedia called 'De Materia Medica' which included the benefits of the soup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia and 12th-century medical scholar Moses Maimonides, recommended chicken soup for respiratory disorders, colds, flu and asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With recommendations tracing back generations, recipes being handed down in families, and a love that lasts a lifetime, chicken soup reigns in American households in winter. But what are you really gaining from the steaming bowl of heaven? Let's find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional value of chicken soup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken soup is often called the "Jewish penicillin" and for all the right reasons.

The vegetables, chicken and broth supply the body with many kinds of nutrients that build up the body's defences. A 2022 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9411684/#sec0001" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Poultry Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that chicken soup alleviates immune suppression by improving peripheral blood levels and stimulating the secretion of immunoglobulin and cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gelatin found in chicken bones is rich in amino acids that support gut health. Drinking chicken soup can soothe the digestive tract and the inner lining of the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandy Allonen, a clinical dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, shared that chicken is high in tryptophan which helps the body produce serotonin, the happy hormone that enhances the mood and provides 'comfort', in a hospital press release. Moreover, a 2009 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228338525_Effect_of_Chicken_Soup_Intake_on_Mood_States_and_Peripheral_Blood_Flow_in_Humans" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Health Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that a 2-week intake of chicken soup significantly reduced tension and anxiety and significantly increased peripheral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enhances joint health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9411684/#sec0001" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Poultry Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found chicken soup to be rich in collagen and peptides. People who consumed chicken-derived collagen saw a 36.9% reduction in joint pain compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, as per a 2021 Nutrients study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves cold&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best-known benefits of chicken soup is how it helps reduce the severity of a cold. A 2025 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that chicken soup reduced symptoms of a cold and shortened the duration of illness. They also found the soup to lower certain markers in the blood that show inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with these health benefits, its delicious taste makes chicken soup a beloved winter food. Thus, keep making that steaming bowl and enjoy sip by sip while cosying up under your blankets and watching your favourite comfort show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Jeff Landry has appointed Evelyn Griffin, a doctor who has worked on maternal mortality and voiced skepticism about vaccines, to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/ralph-abraham-vaccine-louisiana-cdc/article_5b8e4661-9d47-4da1-886f-1b11cf4ed6cb.html"&gt;Louisiana's next surgeon general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œHer clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role,â€� Gov. Jeff Landry said in a release Monday announcing Griffinâ€™s appointment. â€œWith Dr. Griffin stepping in, Iâ€™m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Griffin is a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the top vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was appointed to the panel by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has campaigned against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/national_politics/hepatitis-b-rfk-cassidy-vaccines/article_39be244b-cdd8-4919-a2a5-5109694add12.html"&gt;ACIP voted&lt;/a&gt; to end a three-decade-old recommendation that all infants get the Hepatitis B vaccine and issue weaker guidance for some newborns. Griffin supported that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In a news release announcing her appointment, Landry's office said Griffin's "work included a focus on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality." Louisiana's rates of such deaths is among the highest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin replaces Ralph Abraham, who recently left the statewide post to take a top position at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He drew scrutiny for his decision to end mass vaccination campaigns in the state and for casting doubt over COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

From the best time to take vitamin D to whether baby carrots actually help you sleep, this week’s roundup breaks down the trends worth trying and the simple habits that can support your health right now.

Take our Vitamin D in the morning ☀️ &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D supplements become more popular in the winter because reduced sunlight raises the risk of deficiency. Taking your supplement at the right time may help you get the most benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vitamin D in the evening may reduce melatonin production, interrupting your body's sleep–wake cycle.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your health needs change as you age, and adjusting your supplement plan can help you get the most benefit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen is typically sold as a supplement, while gelatin is more common in cooking and has far less research on its health benefits.

More notably, those who had been vaccinated were a quarter less likely to die in the following four years from any cause than those who were not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a leaked memo from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) – since &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/12-former-fda-heads-call-out-fdas-leaked-memo-claiming-covid-19-vaccines-killed-children-in-bid-to-change-policy-81792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;rejected by 12 former FDA heads&lt;/a&gt; – made claims of 10 deaths allegedly caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. The author, CBER head Vinayak Prasad, provided no details to allow others to assess the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientific studies have been done to test the safety of mRNA vaccines, they have consistently refuted Prasad’s claims, instead showing vaccination to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/largest-real-world-covid-19-vaccine-study-confirms-overwhelming-safety-60785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt; for all ages than infection with the virus. However, the new study, led by French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products researcher Laura Semenzato, stands out in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the sample size is enormous. In countries where individuals need to agree to provide data on their vaccination status and subsequent outcomes, large sample sizes are expensive. Some studies have tried to get around this by using regional statistics, which show death rates were higher where &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vaccinations were least common&lt;/a&gt;, but this approach can’t prove the deaths were among the unvaccinated, logical as that might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Semenzato and co-authors had access to the entire French health data system, where every resident has a number against which their vaccination status and medical outcomes are recorded. This allowed the team to track the outcomes for 28.7 million people, of whom 22.8 million received the first dose of an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 between May and October 2021. Those who were vaccinated outside this window or received a non-mRNA vaccine (which was rare in France) were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Semenzato and co-authors looked at deaths from all causes, not just COVID-19, over 45 months, rather than six or 12 months, as has been more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some anti-vaccination campaigners have limited their opposition to COVID-19 shots to younger people. Semenzato’s study looked at those aged between 18 and 59 on November 1, 2021, so the findings cannot be dominated by those old enough to be considered most at risk of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In raw terms, those who had been vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were found to have a 74 percent lower risk of death from COVID-19 in hospital. Turning to overall deaths, the researchers found that 0.4 percent of the vaccinated cohort had died after almost four years had passed, but this rose to 0.6 percent among the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this doesn’t fit well with Prasad’s claims, and certainly contradicts the wild claims found on social media that mRNA vaccines have “killed millions”, on its own, it’s hardly conclusive. If the populations were not identical – for example, if the unvaccinated contained more people with serious pre-existing health conditions – vaccinations might have nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, records revealed the opposite. Those who got vaccinated were slightly older (by just under a year) on average, and more likely to be women. At the time vaccinations were occurring, those who got vaccinated were also more likely to have potentially dangerous cardiometabolic conditions (9.3 percent compared to 7.8 percent for unvaccinated individuals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French data doesn’t provide data on individual income, but it does indicate people’s approximate residence. Those who lived in the poorest 20 percent of localities were somewhat less likely to get vaccinated, but the difference was fairly modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing for all these factors, the team concluded that mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 was associated with 25 percent lower mortality from any cause. Notably, that includes things like car accidents and natural disasters, which are highly unlikely to be affected by vaccination status. In the first six months after vaccination, the gap was even larger, with deaths among the vaccinated 29 percent lower than the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the mortality gap may not be attributable to the protective effects of the vaccine alone, however.  The reasons why people were not vaccinated during the study period are not known, but it's possible that some of them were swayed by false claims about the vaccine’s dangers. The authors tactfully refer to this and other unknowns, such as education, as residual confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disentangling the effect of the vaccine alone, therefore, will be difficult, but with death rates so low among the vaccinated, claims that the vaccine presents a significant risk to life now appear more implausible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JAMA Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 17:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxNcUU5M3JGYm9QcUZVeVQzZEpPY2xQRnBpLUJFdUJ0cEE2NW9qNmhUVnpRMmNpR2ctVXB6dE9sTTA3ZlFjYWVFV1p2c29EN1Rtb1BsUEtiRUE0cnI2eUVOdGdFeU95eXlwRGFRRG05WDV3YThPdzgyVHE5MEhHM255ampwSHZKZjNPNHRlMFZhaW5OYVlyZVJWM2JCdFl3a1dkdTQtMW9yNldUc1FkNmhBX3ZlNkNkcTJrMzh1d2dmaTNkUk5scXFlUk1SYkRPNDIxVWNZTS1n</guid></item><item><title>每日29便士的“健美运动员”补充剂，可以减少身体脂肪-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15364509/bodybuilders-supplement-body-fat-boost-energy-counteract-effects-Mounjaro-creatine.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Most of the package will go toward the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which supports U.S. crop farmers. (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-to-unveil-12-billion-bailout-for-farmers-064eb1de?mod=hp_lead_pos4&amp;amp;ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-topic"&gt;Today’s topic. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new hepatitis B vaccine guidance. On Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5635408-cdc-vaccine-hepatitis-b-newborns/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 8–3 to eliminate a longstanding recommendation that all newborns receive a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. The committee instead recommended that women who test negative for hepatitis B should consult with their doctors to determine whether their babies should be given the first dose of the vaccine, suggesting that the initial dose be administered after the infant is at least two months old. The committee voted on the change after it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cdc-panel-remade-by-rfk-jr-votes-to-alter-hepatitis-b-vaccine-guidance-fbc1e421?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20committee%20heard,track%20infected%20mothers."&gt;&lt;u&gt;heard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presentations from several vaccine critics; no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subject-matter experts presented to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back up: &lt;/strong&gt;ACIP develops recommendations for the CDC on safe vaccine use and the U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules. The committee’s recommendations also impact which vaccines are covered by insurers and federal health programs. In June, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.readtangle.com/rfk-fires-vaccine-panel-cdc-acip/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all 17 committee members, claiming that they were not capable of independently evaluating the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Kennedy has since &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4zyp26xn2o?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appointed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; new members to ACIP, many of whom have criticized vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is a virus that can cause liver infection and lead to severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death. Prior to Friday’s vote, the CDC had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/health/kennedy-vaccine-committee-vote-hepatitisb.html?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20C.D.C.%20has,like%20diphtheria%2C%20tetanus%20and%20polio."&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for over three decades that infants receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours to newborns with infected mothers and within 24 hours to all other newborns. Doctors and public health experts have widely credited the vaccine with curbing the virus’s prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP members who supported the change said that the risk of newborns contracting the virus if their mothers test negative is very low and called for more substantive studies to determine whether the vaccine is safe for newborns, though past studies have found that it is safe. Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, the acting director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cdc-panel-remade-by-rfk-jr-votes-to-alter-hepatitis-b-vaccine-guidance-fbc1e421?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20newly%20appointed,track%20infected%20mothers."&gt;&lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that children should not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many medical groups, doctors and public health experts criticized the vote, saying that ACIP has become ideologically driven under Secretary Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned as the CDC’s chief medical officer in August, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/health/kennedy-vaccine-committee-vote-hepatitisb.html?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=Dr.%20Debra%20Houry,Dr.%20Houry%20said."&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; she was “very concerned” about the future of the agency under Kennedy, calling it “heartbreaking to see this science-driven agency turn into an ideological machine.” Others warned that the recommendation change will lead to an uptick in hepatitis B. Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill will &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20acting%20director%20of%20the%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention%2C%20Jim%20O%E2%80%99Neill%2C%20is%20expected%20to%20decide%20later%20whether%20to%20accept%20the%20committee%E2%80%99s%20recommendation."&gt;&lt;u&gt;decide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a later date whether to accept ACIP’s new guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115669821715563033?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;praised&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s new guidance, calling it “a very good decision.” He also announced that he had signed a presidential memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a review of childhood vaccine schedules in other countries and “better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule, so it is finally rooted in the Gold Standard of Science and COMMON SENSE!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll survey arguments from the left, right, and subject-matter experts about ACIP’s vote, followed by Executive Editor Isaac Saul’s take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-the-left-is-saying"&gt;What the left is saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The left criticizes the committee’s decision, saying it has no medical justification.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say Kennedy is accomplishing his anti-vaccine goals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Washington Post, Leana S. Wen said &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/05/hepatitis-b-cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendation/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“the CDC’s change to hepatitis B vaccination is even worse than it seems.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the bright side, the policy doesn’t change care for the babies at highest risk: Infants born to mothers known to have hepatitis B will still receive the vaccine, along with a preventive immunoglobulin, to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. And families who want their newborns to receive the hepatitis B shot can still choose it and have it be covered by insurance,” Wen wrote. “But this new approach attempts to solve an issue that doesn’t exist. There is no evidence that the birth dose is unsafe, and no evidence that waiting until two months offers any advantage to safety or efficacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plus, transmission doesn’t just happen mother-to-baby. Hepatitis B can spread through casual contact, including shared household items, small amounts of blood or saliva on toys and surfaces. Everyday interactions such as sharing spoons or cups, handling a baby with microscopic cuts on one’s hands or even inadvertently mixing up toothbrushes can be enough to transmit the virus,” Wen said. “Universal newborn vaccination has helped drive childhood hepatitis B infections down from 18,000 cases in 1991 to just about 20. Why change a policy that has been so effective?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn wrote &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-rfk-wins-acip-cdc-advisory-committee-hepatitis-vaccine?publication_id=87281&amp;amp;post_id=180991961&amp;amp;isFreemail=false&amp;amp;r=lpaxu&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;amp;ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“this is what it looks like when RFK Jr. wins.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exactly how (or when) the new hepatitis B vaccine guidelines would change actual behavior is difficult to say. It’s not as if anybody forces parents to get their kids vaccinated today, the proof being that some parents decline the hepatitis B shot for their kids already,” Cohn said. “But there’s a reason both supporters and critics of vaccines fight about these guidelines: They really do affect decision-making. They signal to parents what top scientists believe is the smartest course of action. And they can influence physicians, who look to bodies like the CDC to undertake the kind of ongoing, exhaustive literature and research reviews they don’t personally have time to do on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy has gone well beyond recruiting some contrarians with novel perspectives. He has populated the advisory committee almost exclusively with people with records of attacking vaccines in one way or another,” Cohn wrote. “The best-case scenario is that the health system’s collective muscle memory on hepatitis B is strong enough to keep current practices going… But in a highly politicized environment where the president and the nation’s top health care officials are constantly talking down vaccines, some people are bound to take their word seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-the-right-is-saying"&gt;What the right is saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the right say the change simply aligns the U.S. with other countries. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say the value of the CDC acting as a vaccine authority is limited. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The Daily Caller, Emily Kopp said ACIP’s decision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/05/acip-childhood-vaccines-hepatitis-b/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“align[s] childhood vaccination schedule with other high-income nations.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pivot away from a universal shot within hours of birth aligns the U.S. policy with the approach of 24 other high-income nations that recommend a first dose at two months old or three months old,” Kopp wrote. “Though the American Hepatitis B vaccine schedule now resembles those of other Western nations, and despite the continued availability of the vaccine to all mothers, the legacy media characterized the decision as a reckless upheaval. ‘CDC panel makes most sweeping revision to child vaccine schedule under RFK Jr.,’ a Washington Post headline blares.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of the committee members agreed that the committee lacks key data on the risks and benefits. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not require randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of the two Hepatitis B vaccines that it approved for the first day of life in the 1980s, according to FDA Acting Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Tracy Beth Høeg,” Kopp said. “‘The data that we used to approve the Hepatitis B vaccines … were based on studies that had a very short-term follow-up and no control group,’ said Høeg… [She] identified anaphylaxis and fever as rare side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Cato, Jeffrey A. Singer wrote about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/why-medical-guidance-shouldnt-come-washington?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“why medical guidance shouldn’t come from Washington.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many professional medical and public health organizations oppose the decision, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the American Pharmacists Association, as well as numerous clinical researchers and medical specialists,” Singer said. “This episode highlights a deeper institutional problem. As I have written previously, ‘Members of the medical and scientific community who have long supported an active government role in health issues likely never expected that a controversial figure like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr… would become the leader of the country’s public health system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores why… Congress should return the CDC to its original purpose: being a focused partner that assists states in tracking and controlling infectious diseases. The federal government should leave medical and scientific debates to scientists and clinicians. By involving itself in these debates, the CDC fosters the impression that there is a single ‘right answer’ to complex, nuanced questions,” Singer wrote. “If there’s a silver lining, it’s that controversies like this may finally encourage clinicians, researchers, and patients to rely less on federal pronouncements and more on diverse, independent medical expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-medical-professionals-are-saying"&gt;What medical professionals are saying.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical professionals uniformly criticize the change in guidance, saying it has no scientific basis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others suggest the change will put an undue burden on parents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Association of Immunologists said they were &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.aai.org/2025/12/05/acip-recommendation-first-dose-hepb-vaccine/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“extremely disappointed”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in the recommendation change. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The science behind the hepatitis B vaccine is robust and well-established. The hepatitis B vaccine has an exceptional safety record, and it is extremely effective at preventing lifelong, chronic infection in infants who might otherwise be exposed to the virus during childbirth or early life,” the group wrote. “More than 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B at or around birth will go on to develop chronic hepatitis B. Of those, roughly one in four face a premature death from liver disease or liver cancer. The impact this has on families, and the healthcare system, can be effectively mitigated with use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Delaying the vaccine would mark a dangerous departure from decades of achievement in preventing hepatitis B infection and its complications. Recent independent analysis warns that even a modest delay could result in a substantial increase in preventable chronic infections, liver cancers, and deaths. Now is not the time to undermine confidence in one of the most successful vaccine-based public health interventions in modern history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Your Local Epidemiologist, Katelyn Jetelina shared her &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/acip-key-takeaways-what-really-happened?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“key takeaways”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; from the vote. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the end, the committee voted to move America back to pre-1991 by removing the universal vaccination recommendation for the Hepatitis B infant dose despite no new evidence of harm and ignoring clear benefits. They also recommended that parents ask clinicians for an antibody blood test to determine the need for subsequent doses, even though there’s no evidence that this works,” Jetelina said. “This ultimately shifts the burden to clinicians and parents and abdicates the responsibility of the recommending body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where this goes from here depends on what happens next. If confusion dominates headlines and clinical practice and falsehoods fill the void, the consequences will be serious. But if we respond the way we saw many do today — pushing back with clarity, authority, evidence, coordination, and grassroots strength — the harm can be contained and minimized,” Jetelina wrote. “Unfortunately, our work is not done. There will be increasing confusion about evidence-based vaccination options for parents, clinicians, hospital systems, and schools. This will decrease vaccination coverage, leading to more disease and unnecessary suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="my-take"&gt;My take.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: “My take” is a section where we give ourselves space to share a personal opinion.

Even for a professional information consumer like me, separating fact from fiction is a scary and fraught process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is intensified by the &lt;em&gt;actual experience &lt;/em&gt;of vaccinating: holding an infant child down on a table while they get pricked and prodded, them crying in pain and then (often) experiencing a day or two of fussiness and fever. &lt;em&gt;Are they okay? What have I done? Was this really worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you are reading a politics newsletter right now, I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to give you or your children medical advice. Instead, I will speak to my own experience, and how some vaccination decisions for children feel less obvious than others. Getting a Covid vaccine for an infant, for instance, did not seem straightforward. Unlike with other vaccines, our doctor was much less forceful in her opinion about what we should do. Covid vaccines are new and less tested for infants, and Covid is often less dangerous for young children. My wife had Covid while she was pregnant, and our baby breast fed (so he was, theoretically, getting antibodies from her, since she was vaccinated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; had the virus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before our son arrived, my wife and I decided on a process for making these decisions: We were going to pick one or two trusted sources &lt;em&gt;outside of our medical team, &lt;/em&gt;and use the information from our doctors combined with those sources to make informed decisions. That way, we could try to ignore the firehose of information we encounter every time we open a social media app or turn on the news. For us, the source we leaned on most heavily was Emily Oster, the professional economist behind the best-seller &lt;em&gt;Expecting Better&lt;/em&gt; and the parenting website &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parent Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who makes decisions through a data-first framework. Her educated opinion felt like a nice complement to the medical advice from our doctors, and she provided a trustworthy single source for the unavoidable questions that pop up during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be candid: My wife and I didn’t seriously consider skipping the hepatitis B vaccine when our son was born. We had decided to lean on the wisdom of my wife’s doctor and Oster, who both said the decision carried close to zero risk and offered only upside. We might have had one drawn out discussion after our doula told us we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pass on the vaccine when my wife tested negative for the virus, but we didn’t see any compelling reason to question the advice of our medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is the lens through which I’ve been watching this story unfold. Even though I’m not personally someone who would trust a government guideline above all else, I do think agencies like the CDC must present reliable, clear information for parents navigating these difficult decisions. Unfortunately, after picking new members for ACIP to ensure vaccine-skeptical outcomes like this, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is offering parents like me only more doubt and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the effects of the new panel’s first major decision, I turned to two public health commentators whose insight I trust: Dr. Leana S. Wen, an open-minded public health expert (who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/fluoride-water-kennedy-rfk-brain-development/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;backed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy’s push to remove fluoride from water), and Katelyn Jetelina (the epidemiologist behind &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your Local Epidemiologist&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Both were alarmed. Jetelina emphasized that the outcome is not as bad as some headlines make it seem, given that the vaccine will still be widely available and eligible for insurance coverage, yet her trepidation came through. She offered a worried but &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/acip-key-takeaways-what-really-happened?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;optimistic take&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how public pressure and a few determined ACIP members were able to push back on the flimsiness of some of the claims presented to the committee and prevent a far worse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wen instead &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/05/hepatitis-b-cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendation/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;focused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mostly on the practical effects of the new guideline outcome: That parents will now be asked to test antibody levels in their children after the first of the vaccine’s three-dose series. After our two-day stay in the hospital after our son was born, we had a one-month check-up, a three-month check-up, and a six-month check-up. Paired with a couple of visits for a rash here or a fever there and various follow-ups with individual specialists, parents of even a healthy baby already end up going to the doctor eight or 10 times in the first ten months. Adding another infant blood draw, another doctor’s appointment, and more cost to the already overwhelming early infancy is — to me — pretty preposterous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I found the counterpoints to this view unconvincing. Some writers claimed the vaccine addresses a non-existent risk. The blogger streiff &lt;a href="https://redstate.com/streiff/2025/12/05/cdcs-vaccine-committee-reverses-decades-long-infant-vaccination-requirement-and-subservience-to-pharma-n2196864?ref=readtangle.com#google_vignette"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Every expectant mother is tested for the virus when she is admitted for delivery and, if she is positive, the infant can be vaccinated then.” This simply isn’t true. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/diagnosis-testing/index.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommends testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the first trimester, not at delivery, and many mothers (including my wife) are only tested for hepatitis early on in pregnancy. That test is &lt;em&gt;consulted&lt;/em&gt; during delivery — but a new test is often not administered if the mother was negative. That means new mothers could have become carriers for the virus and without knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commentators have also emphasized that this new guidance brings us in line with many other peer nations. But those nations are not really our peers when it comes to healthcare or population. Denmark, for instance, has universal healthcare, more consistent prenatal care, and perhaps most importantly, a smaller and much less diverse population than us (with a &lt;a href="https://en.ssi.dk/surveillance-and-preparedness/surveillance-in-denmark/annual-reports-on-disease-incidence/h/hepatitis-b-2023---acute-and-chronic?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lower incidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B). Our healthcare systems and populations are different enough that I think looking to Denmark for guidance is a self-defeating task. We should do what works for us, not for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again: I’ll re-emphasize that my perspective is not expert, and that a variety of expert viewpoints is &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;for new parents. Secretary Kennedy often promotes a similar message. But the actions of the department he leads actually shut down genuine scientific exchange of ideas, which to me is the most frightening aspect of ACIP’s decision. For their latest meeting, Kennedy broke from tradition by refusing to allow presentations from CDC subject-matter experts. So while scientists who study the hepatitis B vaccine for a living were shut out from deliberations, a lawyer and longtime Kennedy ally named Aaron Siri (who has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;petitioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government to stop distributing the polio vaccine!) was able to state his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is decidedly &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;scientific debate; it’s working towards a desired outcome. And while this particular outcome isn’t the worst-case scenario, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another worrying step for Kennedy’s Health Department — and it will have real practical implications for parents and infants who are unlucky enough to encounter hepatitis B in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the survey: &lt;/strong&gt;How does the latest change affect your trust in CDC vaccine recommendations? &lt;a href="https://interrobang.vercel.app/survey/72c2c5e8-616a-4af7-b356-736974543d50?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Let us know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disagree?

Is that renaming official? If so, why does Tangle not use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Adam from Denver, CO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tangle: &lt;/strong&gt;In a sense, he’s both — and no, the rename is not official. In the White House’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-the-united-states-department-of-war/?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;September 5 fact sheet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announcing the Trump Administration’s restoration of the name “Department of War,” the title is officially stated to be “secondary.” A secondary title is one that agencies can use to refer to themselves in official government communications and often matches their already utilized informal names, and are usually inversions (like &lt;em&gt;Justice Department&lt;/em&gt; instead of Department of Justice) and are often abbreviations (like &lt;em&gt;DOE&lt;/em&gt; for Department of Energy). Only Congress has the authority to officially rename a federal department or agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tangle, we have a policy of using the official name of the department as a default, but we often use informal titles so our reporting sounds more natural and less repetitive. For example, we might occasionally refer to the Department of Defense as &lt;em&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/em&gt; (the department’s headquarters), and we could refer to the Central Intelligence Agency as &lt;em&gt;Langley &lt;/em&gt;(the Virginia city where the CIA is headquartered). But when it comes to a &lt;em&gt;person’s&lt;/em&gt; title, we’re always going to use the official name; that means we’re not going to write &lt;em&gt;Secretary of War,&lt;/em&gt; just as we’d never write &lt;em&gt;Secretary of the Pentagon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s broaden the scope and ask a tougher question: Would Tangle ever write the Department of War? Maybe, but it’s trickier for us to adopt. First, informal names are often determined by popular usage, not top-down dictum, so we’re resistant to follow a government order to change a title we’ve been using without issue all our lives. Second, the Department of Defense has &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/articles/department-of-war-defense-name-changes?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a history behind its name&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of War that existed from 1789–1947 is actually not the exact same as the modern DoD. At first, that agency only oversaw the Army, while the Navy had its own cabinet-level department. President Truman consolidated the departments, along with the new Air Force, under the “National Military Establishment” in 1947 — then he restructured them again into the “Department of Defense” in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also emphasized the military’s use as a deterrent and deemphasized “war” as a cabinet-level pursuit for our government, so bringing back the older title seems like a step in the other direction. Maybe we’ll write it occasionally, but it’s not a title we’re eager to employ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to have a question answered in the newsletter?

The company had planned to continue reducing operations at the plant before the Trump administration intervened to block the move in September; U.S. Steel now says that demand for steel has risen enough to warrant a restart in production, particularly as the company completes renovations at other steel mills. “We are confident in our ability to safely and profitably operate the mill to meet 2026 demand,” U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-steel-to-restart-blast-furnace-at-plant-trump-pushed-to-preserve-839fba2f?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Wall Street Journal has the story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

1,915 readers responded to our survey on the special election in Tennessee with 44% saying the results provide a slightly better signal for Democrats than Republicans. “If the Democrats can’t pick more palatable candidates, it won’t matter that there's fairly widespread discontent for the current Republicans,” one respondent said. “I don't put too much stock in off-cycle special elections held in the middle of the holiday season,” said another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 600w, https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 1000w, https://www.readtangle.com/content/images/2025/12/data-src-image-49765eee-6834-4e01-b02f-1189e8cc1cb9.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id="have-a-nice-day"&gt;Have a nice day.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40% of families in the Standing Rock Reservation live below the poverty line. Tribal-owned energy group SAGE had an idea for an initiative to return investment: promoting electric vehicle access in the rural community where gas prices significantly raise the cost of living. Through a regional initiative called “Electric Nation,” SAGE spent three years installing EV chargers along the border of North and South Dakota, and the project wrapped at the end of November. “Even though tribes have been skipped over and underfunded, they’ve become a keystone to filling in infrastructure gaps in rural America,” Len Necefer, a Navajo citizen and energy expert, said. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/climate/electic-vehicle-chargers-north-dakota.html?ref=readtangle.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times has the story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

After a bevy of tests, they found that KJ has an ultra-rare genetic condition, called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, that impairs the body’s ability to process protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body breaks down proteins, it produces ammonia — a toxic substance that is usually processed by enzymes in the liver and excreted in urine. CPS1 deficiency compromises one of these enzymes, causing ammonia to accumulate in the blood, which can eventually damage the brain. The condition can be treated with a liver transplant, but about half of all babies with CPS1 deficiency die in early infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of KJ’s doctors, paediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, wondered whether there might be another solution — correcting the faulty enzyme in his liver. She and Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had a bold plan to treat children with rare genetic disorders using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19773" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapies tailored to unique DNA sequences&lt;/a&gt;. KJ could be their first candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous gene-editing therapies were designed to treat many people. The first approved CRISPR therapy, called Casgevy, could potentially treat tens of thousands of people with one of two blood disorders. By contrast, KJ’s therapy would work only for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used an offshoot of CRISPR genome editing, called base editing, to target the problematic mutation — one faulty DNA letter out of the three billion in the human genome — and correct it (&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;K. Musunuru &lt;i&gt;et al. N. Engl. J. Med. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;392&lt;/b&gt;, 2235–2243; 2025&lt;/a&gt;). Such a hyper-personalized editing therapy had never been made so quickly; KJ might only have a few months before ammonia overwhelmed his small body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it took a large team of researchers in academia and industry to make it happen. While KJ charmed everyone he met at the hospital, Musunuru and his lab members shielded themselves from learning any personal details about him, even his name. “There were certain go or no-go points where key decisions had to be made,” Musunuru says. “We had to be objective with respect to the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing companies worked around the clock to make the gene-editing components needed to treat KJ. “We estimated that it would take 18 months,” says Sandy Ottensmann, a vice-president at Integrated DNA Technologies in Coralville, Iowa. “We did it in six.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 25 February, KJ received the first of three infusions. His tolerance for protein in his diet has increased, but he still needs medication and regular monitoring to ensure that his ammonia levels stay in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But here was powerful validation that the window for treating the rare, hereditary condition remains open — offering a chance for meaningful, disease-modifying interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-infographic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a giant step forward,” says Tabrizi, who was the trial’s lead scientific adviser. “The dial has been shifted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-in-class gene therapy — called AMT-130 and developed by uniQure, a biotechnology company in Amsterdam — uses a harmless virus to deliver strands of genetic material into affected brain regions. Once there, the therapy switches off production of the faulty mutant huntingtin protein that slowly destroys brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical data set was small, involving just 12 people who received a high dose of the therapy. And the treatment is invasive, requiring lengthy brain surgery. But &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track="click" data-label="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track="click" data-label="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;he results were striking&lt;/a&gt;. On a standard rating scale used to assesses motor and cognitive functions and other measures of daily living, the scores of participants receiving the high dose dropped by just 0.38 points over three years. That’s compared with a reduction of 1.52 points for people in a control group, meaning that the treatment slowed the rate of decline by 75%. That clinical benefit was reinforced by molecular validation: spinal-fluid levels of a protein linked to dying brain cells had gone down in the treatment recipients, the opposite of what typically occurs as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After digesting the findings, Tabrizi and her close collaborator Ed Wild, a fellow neurologist at University College London, shared what Wild describes as a “massive hug”. But, after that, it was right back to the daily demands of patient care and research. “We’ll celebrate very unreservedly — but briefly,” Wild says. “We’re like an episode of &lt;i&gt;The West Wing&lt;/i&gt;: it’s always, ‘What’s next?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next for Tabrizi and Wild are leading roles in evaluating five other huntingtin-lowering therapies in clinical development, along with several others poised to enter human trials soon. Tabrizi is also spearheading laboratory studies into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration — work that could yield many other drug candidates in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sarah is amazing,” says Hugh Rickards, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “She’s the spider in the middle of the web. You name a disease-modifying therapy in HD — she’s got her hand on it somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, “she’s one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet”, says Samuel Frank, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who, like Rickards, has worked with Tabrizi on Huntington’s trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing a part in nearly every important clinical advance means that she also carries the scars of the field’s most agonizing disappointments. Only four years ago, another &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;romising huntingtin-targeted therapy&lt;/a&gt;, tominersen, faltered in late-stage trials. Overall, the drug failed to improve people’s outcomes compared with those of the control group and it came with dangerous side effects at higher doses. As principal investigator of the nearly 800-person study, the unenviable task of explaining the results to participating families fell to Tabrizi. “It was heartbreaking,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalls her message to the distraught community: “Trials are scientific experiments,” she says. “Through failure, as painful as it is, is often how you learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
