Back in the day, her filmmaker father, &lt;b&gt;Richard Leacock&lt;/b&gt;, made two movies with &lt;b&gt;RFK&lt;/b&gt;– &lt;i&gt;Primary in Crisis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hickory Hill.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A very large man running security on the Kennedy scion let her approach.

			&lt;p&gt;Protein intake dominates fitness advice. Whether you want to build muscle, improve your fitness or watch your weight, the common advice handed out by everyone from fitness influencers to doctors is that we need more protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while protein does play an essential role in maintaining our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38840697/"&gt;muscle mass and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, all this increased attention on the importance of protein &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/high-protein-food-diet-recipes-dr-rupy-aujla-b2720439.html"&gt;in the media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a754243/how-much-protein-should-i-eat-to-build-muscle/"&gt;fitness circles&lt;/a&gt; has sparked a surge in products marketed specifically for their protein content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chocolate bars, ice cream, pizza,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and even alcoholic beverages now &lt;a href="https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/97003-protein-flexes-its-muscles-as-consumers-look-to-add-more-protein-to-diet"&gt;market themselves as protein foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our enthusiasm for protein might have gone too far. While protein is certainly important for our health, most of us don't need these protein-enhanced foods as a regular feature in our diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that this marketing may lead to a '&lt;a href="https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(19)30614-1/pdf"&gt;halo effect&lt;/a&gt;', where consumers mistakenly equate high protein content with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1139"&gt;overall nutritional value&lt;/a&gt;. This effect can lead to the perception of protein-rich foods being inherently nutritious – even though many may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(24)00176-1/abstract"&gt;maintaining muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259402/"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrition guidelines recommend people aim to eat &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coma-reports"&gt;around 0.75 g of protein&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of body weight. But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11329409/"&gt;some evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; this recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723001446?via%3Dihub"&gt;may be an underestimate&lt;/a&gt; – and that the recommendation should be around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960445/"&gt;1.2 g-1.6 g per kg of body weight per day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong body of evidence that suggests the amount of protein we need changes depending on our health. For instance, people need to eat more protein when they're &lt;a href="https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03693-4"&gt;recovering from an illness&lt;/a&gt;. Research also shows that &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(13)00326-5/fulltext"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; should be aiming for at least 1.2 g per kg of body weight in order to combat &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/78/Supplement_1/67/7199271"&gt;age-related muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes also need to eat a greater amount of protein to &lt;a href="https://origin.health.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2014-june_elevate_health.pdf"&gt;support their training and recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, with the rising popularity of weight-loss drugs, strategies increasingly emphasise protein intake to &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/73/Supplement_1/14-PUB/156089/14-PUB-The-Effect-of-Structured-Intensive"&gt;minimise muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; while losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just because protein is good for maintaining muscle mass, that doesn't mean more is better. In fact, it seems that even when we &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5828430/"&gt;consume large amounts of protein&lt;/a&gt;, only a some of this is actually used by the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us probably need a little more protein than current guidelines suggest, but less than is often promoted by wellness influencers on social media (with some even suggesting we need up to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/wolfcoach_/reel/DCUyAeJIH7K/"&gt;3 g of protein per kg of body weight&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the necessary amount of protein suggested by emerging evidence (&lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/apnm-2020-0760"&gt;1.2 g -1.6 g&lt;/a&gt; per kg of body weight per day) is close to what the &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/key-findings-from-ndns-report-for-years-9-to-11-combined/"&gt;average protein consumption already is&lt;/a&gt; in most western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can probably benefit from being more protein aware – not about how much protein they're consuming, but about the quality and frequency of their protein choices. Ideally, we should aim to consume small amounts of protein-rich foods more often during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current evidence suggests around &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;20 g-30 g of protein&lt;/a&gt; (around a handful of a protein source) at each meal supports muscle maintenance alongside physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, this protein would come from whole foods (such as nuts, seeds, milk, eggs and legumes). But fortified protein products may have their space as a quick and easy snack – especially for those who may struggle to eat this much protein at each meal. It's important to eat these foods in moderation, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are full of "protein-enhanced" products. But while these products may contain additional protein, they may also contain additional sugars or carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, protein milk often contains &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/high-protein-milk-its-not-just-milk-added-protein-powder"&gt;double the protein&lt;/a&gt; of regular milk. It does this by removing water or adding dried milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein bars are another example. But depending on the brand you choose, alongside their additional protein content they may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/well/eat/protein-bars.html"&gt;high in sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many protein-fortified products share another common trait: they fall into the category of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-protein-powder-protein-shake-110306908.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIBi1_2t4Yd7wU45o2XrHxyD3cJNSkbxNZ_oKTdMcEmMGC-MTxQOhxAsaKJSedLMG7HhWzJp44aL6nf0UFQwqoevTnMz3JF3uBDhvzwjK6-ACOpIQi4lAkxQFfVHeQ9uMRkmXRTr_O-RCsOAGHpUbIMBm8yZ940rt5vVk1w4_nuA"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/position-statement-on-the-concept-of-ultra-processed-foods-upf"&gt;commercially made products&lt;/a&gt; that include ingredients you wouldn't typically find in your own kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows regularly consuming ultra-processed foods is consistently linked with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363072/"&gt;poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; – such as cardiovascular diseases and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Current discussions around ultra-processed foods suggests uncertainty regarding whether it's the processing itself, the poor nutritional quality of these foods or the combination of both of these factors that contribute to these negative health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue with protein-enhanced products is that while they do indeed contain extra protein, some products &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-scoop-on-protein-powder-2020030918986"&gt;may lack fibre&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and essential minerals. A &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(23)00363-1/abstract"&gt;lack of fibre&lt;/a&gt; in modern diets is currently one of the biggest contributors to population-wide ill-health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All foods have their place within a balanced diet. But protein is only one component of overall nutritional health. The rise in protein-fortified foods as health foods is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein-enhanced products are occasional foods that might support meeting protein intake, but they should not be mistaken for universally healthy foods. For people looking to reach their protein goals, choose a variety of protein sources, consider the role of convenience foods within the context of whole diet and think about other nutrients like fibre to really maximise health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252236/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9318vgn001i3b72mxzxfl95@published"&gt;My husband suffers from serious migraines, but can’t take the medications available to treat them due to his sensitivity to the side effects. Recently he was incapacitated with one, and I asked him if there was anything I could do to help. He responded “How about a blow job?” I laughed about it, but when he said he was serious, I decided to give it a go and see if it made a difference. That’s when things started to get weird.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm931aohy002q3b72fcjuabgb@published"&gt;Amazingly, he felt well enough after about 10 minutes to get back to work (he works from home due to his migraine issue). The thing is, now he wants a blow job every time a migraine strikes. Based on his reaction it actually does seem to alleviate his symptoms! The trouble is that he’s been having migraines and requiring my “help” at least three times a day lately. Is there any medical basis for this, or could he be taking advantage of the situation?&lt;br&gt;—An Unlikely Cure&lt;/p&gt;

To put it more bluntly: Why can’t this guy jerk off to relieve his pain? Has he given you an answer for this? Have you asked?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9318vs0001l3b7203m1dcwi@published"&gt;To be clear, there is data suggesting that sexual activity may actually alleviate his migraines and/or the pain associated with them. A 2013 &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0333102413476374"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cephalalgia&lt;/em&gt; found that 60 percent of survey responders who had experienced sexual activity during a migraine reported that their migraines improved in seeming response. Here “sexual activity” referred to “any sexual intercourse or masturbation with the aim of reaching an orgasm or an orgasm-like feeling.” The study is clear: “the kind of sexual activity did not seem to have any influence on the particular reaction” and “the primary headache associated with sexual activity appears to be independent of the specific sexual methods, e.g. while masturbating.”&lt;/p&gt;

Something tells me no, and that he’s effectively gilding the lily here. Perhaps he has been honest about the pain relief and less so about the necessary means. Incidentally, the study uncovered that men respond to this kind of relief particularly well (73.3 reported sexual activity marking improvement or stopping the migraine attack altogether versus 58 percent of women responders). The study authors postulated that the analgesic effect of sex on migraines may have something to do with the release of endorphins or mere distraction from pain.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than simply responding to pleasure or pain, serotonin appears to encode a “prospective value” signal—telling the brain how good the near future is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using reinforcement learning models and neural recordings from serotonin-rich regions, researchers found these neurons respond most to unexpected rewards. This insight sheds new light on the complex role of serotonin in decision-making, learning, and emotion, potentially changing how we understand mood disorders and mental health treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospective Value Code:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons encode expected future rewards, not just pleasure or pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons are especially activated by unexpected rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could reshape understanding of decision-making and mental health treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our day-to-day lives, we’re constantly making a slew of decisions from immediate matters to prospects on the far horizon. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evolutionary nuts-and-bolts of how our brains weigh these numerous daily decisions and what role is played by the neurotransmitter serotonin has been shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108403"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study led by an interdisciplinary uOttawa Faculty of Medicine team delivers fascinating findings on this big topic and potentially unravels a hidden aspect of what our nervous system’s extraordinarily complex serotonin system is really doing inside the enigmatic organ in our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, this study from a highly impactful international collaboration was considered by one of the expert reviewers who evaluated the work to offer “broad implications across neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, enhancing our understanding of serotonin’s role in mood regulation, learning, and motivated behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s innovative work merges ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) theory – used in neuroscience to better understand learning, behavior, and decision-making – with recent hard-won insights into the filtering properties of the brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus. That’s a region of the mammalian brainstem rich in serotonin-producing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is often painted as the brain’s “pleasure chemical.” Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) famously target the serotonin system as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, serotonin’s precise role in the nervous system is ambiguous and perplexing: It’s implicated in everything from mood and movement regulation to appetite and sleep-wake cycles. The fact that it’s activated by pain, pleasure and surprise has long been a brain research puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, the uOttawa-led researchers put forth a unifying perspective on serotonin they dub a “prospective code for value” – a biological code for how the brain places a value for future rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code essentially explains why serotonin neurons are activated in the brain in response to both rewards and punishments, with a preference for surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work asks the question: What does serotonin tell the brain? In a nutshell, we find that its message closely matches the expectation of future rewards,” says senior author Dr. Richard Naud, associate professor at the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicineand the uOttawa Department of Physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, puts the main findings like this: “Your brain needs to compute the expected value of the actions you contemplate and undertake as you interact with a changing world, asking ‘What’s the value of this decision versus that decision in that particular environment?’ That’s a hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So what we think serotonin actually does in the brain is encode the expected value of a particular environment or course of actions in order to ultimately guide everyday decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs.

Existing theories centring on reward, surprise, salience and uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

Cosmetic surgery is "more normalised", she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting "fatigue" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;And the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as "skinny jabs", are getting surgery on their face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, "more and more" are people taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'There's not as much stigma'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said her "breasts were basically down to my bellybutton" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b6/live/f62f7090-1216-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kirsten White A selfie taken by a smiling woman with brunette hair" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Kirsten White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Kirsten White says there's less stigma about people getting cosmetic procedures&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Men underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 -

&lt;p&gt;West Texas has been gripped by a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles/t-62853301"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreak for the past several weeks and as a result of misinformation passed on by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., it now faces a second, related health problem: Vitamin A toxicity — or hypervitaminosis A — in infants and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation appears to be the direct result of bogus medical information pedaled by the vaccine-skeptic secretary himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently said that although the measles vaccine is the best defense against the highly contagious and potentially fatal infection, he emphasized that getting inoculated was a "personal choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, whom President Donald Trump appointed to be the nation's top health advisor, suggested, "vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality," or even prevent measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently directed the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to update measles guidance to promote vitamin A use in fighting the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March, the CDC's top communications officer, Thomas Corry, cited Kennedy's slow response to the West Texas outbreak and his embrace of so-called "alternative measles treatment," as the reason for his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous other CDC and HHS officials have resigned since Kennedy took over, more health workers still —so far at least 10,000 — have also fallen prey to Elon Musk's cost-cutting measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, HHS has lost a quarter of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="72149000" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/72149000_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A headshot of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on February 13, 2025 "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, has pedaled debunked medical information for years, now his advice appears to be hurting children in Texas (FILE: February 13, 2025)&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Laura Brett/picture alliance &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;West Texas anti-vax parents making their kids sick on Kennedy's bad advice?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Kennedy and the CDC suggest vitamin A should only be taken under doctor's supervision, West Texas parents are apparently giving their children so much of it that they are now being admitted to hospital emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other remedies, Kennedy has claimed that cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamins A and D, "works" as a treatment against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although vitamin A may be given to measles patients who suffer malnutrition-related vitamin A deficiencies, there is no evidence suggesting that it is effective in preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though it is known that excessive cod liver oil consumption can have serious negative health consequences, demand for it has exploded in West Texas, with pharmacies saying, "it's flying off the shelf."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, has said it has treated "fewer than 10 cases" of vitamin A toxicity over the past couple of weeks. Administrators say the children were initially admitted with measles symptoms but later determined to have had abnormally functioning livers as a result of vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Covenant are publicly warning against excessive vitamin A intake, saying that it could lead to severe side effects such as dry skin, impaired sight, bone problems and liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines the only proven prevention against measles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) on Friday said that it had &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles-in-texas-a-deadly-disease-that-can-be-prevented/a-68121991"&gt;recorded 481 cases of measles since January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" title="External link — The number of nationwide measles cases stood at 607 as of April 4, according to the CDC."&gt; The number of nationwide measles cases stood at 607 as of April 4, according to the CDC.&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles — a highly contagious respiratory &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;infection that spreads&lt;/a&gt; when an infected individual sneezes, coughs or speaks, as well as when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after contact with a contaminated surface — was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 thanks to decades of sustained mass-vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/why-measles-is-so-deadly-and-vaccination-so-important/a-47743349"&gt;only effectively proven method of preventing measles is the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which boasts 97% efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, the Texas DSHS confirmed the death of a "school-age child who was not vaccinated" and who had "tested positive for measles" when she was hospitalized.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first confirmed measles death in the US since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032724019566" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that higher intake of sugary and artificially sweetened drinks was related to a greater risk of depression among younger adults, while fruit juices and coffee were associated with a lower risk of both depression and anxiety across age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, based at Wenzhou Medical University in China, conducted the study to explore how beverage choices might influence the risk of depression and anxiety disorders. While previous studies have suggested possible links between diet and mental health, most focused on broad dietary patterns or small groups. There has been less clarity on how specific beverages relate to mental health outcomes, especially across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mental health conditions on the rise globally, the research team wanted to examine whether commonly consumed drinks—like sugary soft drinks, diet beverages, fruit juice, coffee, milk, and tea—are linked to long-term mental health outcomes, and whether replacing one type of beverage with another might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, the researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health study that follows over 500,000 people in the United Kingdom. For this study, they focused on 188,355 adults between the ages of 37 and 73. Participants had completed one or more online diet surveys between 2009 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surveys recorded how many servings of specific beverages participants had consumed the previous day. One serving was defined as a glass, can, carton, or 250 milliliters. The study tracked six types of drinks: sugar-sweetened beverages (like soft drinks), artificially sweetened beverages (such as diet sodas), pure fruit and vegetable juices, milk, coffee, and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine mental health outcomes, the researchers analyzed 11 years worth of hospital and primary care records. They identified new diagnoses of depression and anxiety using standardized medical codes. People who already had depression or anxiety at the start of the study were excluded. The analysis adjusted for a wide range of lifestyle, dietary, and health factors that might influence mental health, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, physical activity, body weight, sleep habits, smoking, alcohol use, and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the follow-up period, more than 5,800 participants developed depression and over 6,400 developed anxiety disorders. Among people under age 60, those who drank more than one serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a 14 percent higher risk of developing depression compared to those who avoided them. Similarly, those who drank more than one serving of artificially sweetened drinks per day had a 23 percent higher risk. On the other hand, people under 60 who consumed more than one serving of pure fruit or vegetable juice each day had a 19 percent lower risk of depression, while those who drank coffee regularly had a 12 percent lower risk. Coffee was also linked to a reduced risk of anxiety in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people aged 60 and older, the patterns were somewhat different. There was no clear link between sugary or artificially sweetened drinks and mental health. However, drinking more pure fruit or vegetable juice and coffee was again associated with a lower risk of both depression and anxiety. Tea and milk did not show consistent relationships with either condition, although replacing milk with coffee or juice in this older group was associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how beverage swaps might influence mental health, the researchers performed a substitution analysis. This method estimates what might happen if one type of drink is replaced by another. For adults under 60, replacing one daily serving of a sugar-sweetened drink with a serving of pure fruit juice or coffee was linked to a significantly lower risk of both depression and anxiety. For example, switching from soda to juice was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of depression. For older adults, replacing milk with fruit juice or coffee was associated with a lower risk of both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings remained consistent across various types of statistical analyses. These included removing participants who were current smokers or had early diagnoses, testing the results using different models, and examining the effects over shorter and longer time frames. These steps were taken to reduce the chance that the results could be explained by other factors or by changes in behavior that occurred after early symptoms of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its large sample size, the study has some limitations to consider. First, it relied on medical records to identify depression and anxiety diagnoses, which might miss milder cases that never reached clinical attention. The researchers also acknowledged that their findings are observational. This means they can show associations, but not prove that the beverages themselves caused the mental health outcomes. It is possible that people who were already at higher risk for depression or anxiety tended to drink more sweetened beverages, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.069" target="_blank"&gt;Ages-specific beverage consumption and its association with depression and anxiety disorders: A prospective cohort study in 188,355 participants&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by  Jiali Xie, Zhixian Huang, Yinan Mo, Yixuan Pan, Yubin Ruan, Wen Cao, Yinuo Chen, Yaojia Li, Kezheng Li, Danqing Yu, and Binbin Deng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>psypost.org</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 14:16:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQSS1KQXd1eWRkWVlmWG5aUlM3VUotTVZraXpmdFhnOEJFWDhqYzhLeEllSmZWUkwxNXA3dzUzVThXc09QczN4SGJyekZTTzJCanV0NUlFUGQxUjd6ZVBYbXcyN0d1YmV5WDlfYllNWF9RMnZLWnZpVGpKdk8yRlZKTGdUQW1najVyaE9uZk9leEJvblZSd2FwTFlXMnNjeUdIRFFxOHNOZGZGUjA</guid></item><item><title>Want To Burn Fat Without Losing Muscle?

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-nature-is-wild-but-is-it-healthier-than-a-dip-in-a-pool"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt;, you'll know all about the short, sharp shock it gives your senses as you plunge in. According to a new study, it can pretty quickly change the stress response of your cells too, and in a potentially positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study researchers, from the University of Ottawa in Canada, got 10 healthy young male adults to take a daily cold water dip in their lab for an hour at a time, while using blood samples to measure how their bodies were reacting on a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, the volunteers showed signs of improved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy cell recycling process that clears waste. In addition, signs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; (programmed cell death) and inflammation reduced over the week, after initially spiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156886" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg" alt="Core temperatures" class="wp-image-156886 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature-600x381.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked core body temperature as well as cell response. (King et al., &lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that consistent cold water submersion may improve our body's fundamental reaction to environmental stress – in this case, chilly temperatures. Here, it made the key stress response of autophagy more protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were amazed to see how quickly the body adapted," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Glen Kenny, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level. It's like a tune-up for your body's microscopic machinery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the initial exposure to cold water – chilled to 14 °C (57.2 °F) – was more chaotic, with "dysfunction" in autophagy processes and increased apoptosis. It settled down and became more beneficial as the week went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests the body does need time to adapt, but that the adaptation doesn't take long. The body seemed to switch from killing off cells in response to the cold conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-hearts-may-have-hidden-self-healing-powers-study-finds"&gt;to repairing cells instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the end of the acclimation, we noted a marked improvement in the participants' cellular cold tolerance," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Kelli King, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that cold acclimation may help the body effectively cope with extreme environmental conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some significant limitations to note here: first, the study only involved 10 people, who were all young men. Researchers are going to need to test this out on bigger groups of participants, including women, to see if the findings apply more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was also carried out in a very controlled lab setting. There was none of the cold air exposure and variations in temperature that you'd get with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-open-water-poses-a-serious-risk-few-people-know-about"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt; for example. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2741/S117"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have shown the way our bodies respond to cold air is different to cold water. &lt;/span&gt;These factors may also influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now found both potential &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-swimming-does-something-amazing-to-your-mind-study-reveals"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cold-water-therapy-might-do-more-harm-than-good-an-expert-explains"&gt;drawbacks&lt;/a&gt; to cold water exposure, but this new discovery could have long-term implications for our bodies: the recycling and cleaning that autophagy takes care of is crucial in preventing disease and limiting some of the wear-and-tear effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adbi.202400111"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Before being elected governor in 2022, he worked as an emergency room doctor and family physician in Hawaii for over 20 years. While serving as lieutenant governor, he led an emergency medical mission to help stop the measles epidemic in Samoa and led Hawaii’s vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic, ranked as one of the most effective in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;America’s children are in danger. Measles outbreaks are spreading in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and beyond, threatening lives, overwhelming health-care resources and exposing vulnerable communities. Texas alone has confirmed more than 400 measles cases and the death of the first child from measles in our country in more than a decade: the heartbreaking loss of a school-age child in Gaines County. The outbreaks continue to spread, gaining momentum and posing a threat to children across our country — with one public health official in Texas fearing that the outbreak there could last an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But this tragic outcome we can see coming doesn’t have to happen. We can prevent it if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious virus that hospitalizes as many as 1 in 5 of those it infects and kills 1 in every 1,000. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw hundreds of thousands of cases every year, many resulting in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Twenty-five years ago, nationwide vaccination efforts had virtually eliminated the disease in the United States by achieving vaccination rates of 95% across the country, establishing herd immunity and preventing the disease from spreading. Today, vaccination rates have been allowed to fall in many states. Experts fear that the elimination of the disease is at risk and that measles may again become a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccination campaigns save lives during outbreaks of deadly viruses. I have witnessed the lifesaving power of vaccines firsthand. During the Covid-19 pandemic – when I was serving as lieutenant governor – we vaccinated over a million people in Hawaii, saving thousands of lives and achieving the lowest infection and mortality rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, a measles outbreak swept through the island nation of Samoa. The spread of antivaccine misinformation in the previous year had caused fear and uncertainty, which kept many families from vaccinating their children against measles. The result was a devastating outbreak that infected more than 5,000 people and killed 83, mostly children. In December of 2019, I led an emergency medical mission from Hawaii to vaccinate 37,000 people in Samoa over 36 hours, rapidly raising the vaccination rate and helping to end the deadly outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from October, there are 14 states in the US where measles vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen to dangerously low levels under 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Communities with vaccination rates below the 95% threshold necessary to maintain herd immunity become fertile ground for measles outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, almost 1 in 5 kindergartners entering the school system is unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also continues to cloud these facts by describing vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoting vitamin A supplementation as a primary response to the measles outbreak. Let me be clear: Vitamin A may lessen measles complications once infection has occurred, but it does not prevent the disease. To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raynard Covarrubio, left, gives an MMR vaccine to 1-year-old River Jacobs , held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, at a vaccine clinic held by the Lubbock Public Health Department in March. - Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 13:00:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQMEdpVW5UMkxXWWkyaFFlRjZlQjBhdXA0MVBnR2lhS243bnJrSUI4aFF2RUxabUlaRUVFMjI1YTMwWWpIQkhEZTlqbFR5Q2wwM2NralF1MWlscU5Yd25Wcjg3eEdJeHk1cWlGZDNxWTFmMTNZODI5V2MzUFpmQldOS2dn</guid></item><item><title>Hawaii governor: An urgent call to action to protect America’s children from measles - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOazRTc1QxT1BjcUlwLUJTY2tGUzE2aDJobGNnZlBVVEVrM1JTeGtORFQ0dkxIZ29RNmxndTJsb3BHd095ckNxQkhPaV9oVjZIX0xfaTAwYWNkc2NpYkNPV3VWc1E3ZWx6ZXJENnlGSXp6QTdaQ05NUkc0WmpOUFlSeFBMNHVhUVhzcGR1cDZxN3bSAYcBQVVfeXFMTlEtbWI2Q0o3bXZaLThQLVJfZWNiblNQMGVfRlJGYkZqWGN1REg3dG02T19jQ3RZdWRDUENiNG8yYWd0VVdhRU1lamdVV2p2d2N6WW5MYWhsb3N0Z2tsSEtNR1VIUURvc3QwaDRBYTBNNi0zaDhtX1hCcGotam5JUEFmNGRFVEhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Josh Green is the governor of Hawaii. Before being elected governor in 2022, he worked as an emergency room doctor and family physician in Hawaii for over 20 years. While serving as lieutenant governor, he led an emergency medical mission to help stop the measles epidemic in Samoa and led Hawaii’s vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic, ranked as one of the most effective in the nation.

            America’s children are in danger. Measles outbreaks are spreading in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and beyond, threatening lives, overwhelming health-care resources and exposing vulnerable communities. Texas alone has confirmed more than 400 measles cases and the death of the first child from measles in our country in more than a decade: the heartbreaking loss of a school-age child in Gaines County. The outbreaks continue to spread, gaining momentum and posing a threat to children across our country — with one public health official in Texas fearing that the outbreak there could last an entire year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00053b6o0id41wws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But this tragic outcome we can see coming doesn’t have to happen. We can prevent it if we act now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00063b6okh2wny1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an extremely contagious virus that hospitalizes as many as 1 in 5 of those it infects and kills 1 in every 1,000. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw hundreds of thousands of cases every year, many resulting in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00073b6o3q7s3aq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twenty-five years ago, nationwide vaccination efforts had virtually eliminated the disease in the United States by achieving vaccination rates of 95% across the country, establishing herd immunity and preventing the disease from spreading. Today, vaccination rates have been allowed to fall in many states. Experts fear that the elimination of the disease is at risk and that measles may again become a threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00083b6oyn5rtp9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination campaigns save lives during outbreaks of deadly viruses. I have witnessed the lifesaving power of vaccines firsthand. During the Covid-19 pandemic – when I was serving as lieutenant governor – we vaccinated over a million people in Hawaii, saving thousands of lives and achieving the lowest infection and mortality rates in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00093b6opxhemb54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, a measles outbreak swept through the island nation of Samoa. The spread of antivaccine misinformation in the previous year had caused fear and uncertainty, which kept many families from vaccinating their children against measles. The result was a devastating outbreak that infected more than 5,000 people and killed 83, mostly children. In December of 2019, I led an emergency medical mission from Hawaii to vaccinate 37,000 people in Samoa over 36 hours, rapidly raising the vaccination rate and helping to end the deadly outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000a3b6o3bfz2iyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from October, there are 14 states in the US where measles vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen to dangerously low levels under 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000b3b6ojj4r9tlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Communities with vaccination rates below the 95% threshold necessary to maintain herd immunity become fertile ground for measles outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, almost 1 in 5 kindergartners entering the school system is unvaccinated against measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000c3b6ookv6sbbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000d3b6ouhggcpsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The economic cost of treating and the often uncompensated cost of caring for those sufferers is now more than $600 billion a year. As our population ages, that number will only grow, with one estimate projecting that the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;will double by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. It is a fate that many of us will one day suffer — according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, adults over 55 have a nearly one in two chance of eventually developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this week delivered one of the brightest spots in an otherwise dark field. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;study that followed more than 280,000 people in Wales&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who received a vaccine against shingles were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia in the seven years that followed vaccination than those who did not receive the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This could be a big deal. There are very few, if any, treatments that can prevent or slow down dementia, beyond good lifestyle habits like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;getting enough sleep and exercise&lt;/a&gt;. The possibility that a known, inexpensive vaccine could offer real protection is enormously meaningful. We have good reason to be confident in the findings: While this study is perhaps the most prominent to show the protective effects of the shingles vaccine, other &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/study-suggests-shingles-vaccine-may-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine have come to similar conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beyond the promise of preventive treatment, the new study adds further evidence to a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/03/17/do-viruses-trigger-alzheimers"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; raising the possibility that we have been thinking about neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s all wrong. It’s possible these horrible conditions are caused by a virus — and if that’s the case, eliminating the virus could be enough to prevent or treat the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To understand why the new shingles vaccine study is such a big deal, it helps to know a little bit about how medical studies are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The gold standard for research is a randomized control trial (RCT). That’s when scientists randomly assign patients to two different groups — one that receives an experimental treatment and another that doesn’t — in order to test the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. Such RCT trials minimize bias or other complicating factors, allowing scientists to be reasonably confident that any differences between the two groups — like the likelihood of developing a disease — are due to the treatment being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the real world, RCTs are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4103/0301-5742.171199#:~:text=This%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20ensure%20sufficient%20statistical%20power."&gt;often difficult and expensive to carry out&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, you need a large sample size to be confident of your results, and the control group can’t receive the treatment being studied, which creates ethical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So a lot of big medical research involves observational studies, which is a fancy term for scientists observing things happening in the real world and drawing conclusions from their research. The upside is you don’t need to go through the time and trouble of gathering a big study group and randomly dividing them in two. The downside is you’re much less certain that any observed effect is due to the variables you’re studying because you don’t control the study; you just observe it,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The new study, though, took advantage of a quirk in Welsh health policy to do something better. Beginning on September 1, 2013, anyone in Wales who was 79 became eligible to receive a free shingles vaccine. (Those who were younger than 79 would become eligible once they turned that age.) But anyone who was 80 or older was not eligible on the grounds that the vaccine is less effective for the very old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result was what is known as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/advice-and-guidance/2009/12/social-research-methods-guides/documents/natural-experiments/natural-experiments/govscot%3Adocument/Natural%2BExperiments.pdf"&gt;natural experiment&lt;/a&gt;.” In effect, Wales had created two groups that were essentially the same — save for the fact that one group received the shingles vaccine and one group did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers looked at the health records of the more than 280,000 adults who were 71 to 88 years old at the start of the vaccination program and did not have dementia. They focused on a group that was just on the dividing line: those who turned 80 just before September 1, 2013, and thus were eligible for the vaccine, and those born just after that date, who weren’t. Then, they simply looked at what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By 2020, seven years after the vaccination program began, about one in eight older adults, who by that time were 86 and 87, had developed dementia. But the group that had received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Because the researchers could find no other confounding factors that might explain the difference — like years of education or other vaccines or health conditions like diabetes — they were confident the shingles vaccine was the difference maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-new-paradigm-in-dementia-research" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A new paradigm in dementia research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the research indicates that the shingles vaccine appears to have “some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia that we know of that are potentially usable in practice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this is a vaccine originally designed to prevent shingles. Why does it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; appear to help with dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists theorize it could be related to inflammation. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the same virus responsible for chickenpox, which lies dormant in nerve cells after an initial infection and can reawaken decades later, causing painful rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That reactivation creates intense inflammation around nerve cells, and chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018624002274#:~:text=Inflammation%20has%20been%20associated%20with,%2C%20chemokines%2C%20and%20adhesion%20molecules."&gt;major factor in cognitive deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. By preventing shingles, the vaccine could indirectly protect against the neural inflammation associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What about the amyloid and tau protein plaques that tend to be found in the brains of people suffering from Alzheimer’s, which have &lt;a href="https://kin.uncg.edu/2025/02/24/plaques-and-tangles/#:~:text=Plaques%20and%20tangles%20block%20communication,detectable%20symptoms%20of%20memory%20loss."&gt;long been thought of as the primary cause of the disease&lt;/a&gt;? It’s possible that these may actually be the body’s response to an underlying infection. That could help explain why treatments that directly target those plaques &lt;a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2024/03/13/why-alzheimers-plaque-attack-drugs-dont-work/"&gt;have been largely ineffective&lt;/a&gt; — because they weren’t targeting the real causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As promising as the new research is, we’re still a long way from finding a silver bullet against Alzheimer’s and dementia. One &lt;a href="https://recruit.cumc.columbia.edu/studyinfopage/1179"&gt;double-blinded RCT&lt;/a&gt; — the gold standard of the gold standard in medicine — that is underway now is examining whether valacyclovir, an antiviral used against the virus that causes shingles, could slow cognitive decline in people with early-stage Alzheimer’s. That would be a true game changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdGVRSFF2aG4xTGpjVmxuTkdkN3RxcE1wNXZvRVhUcUMxX2x5dnpsQUNreFpuX193TnYzQkEzcTRUdjNIRGFJVFdrTGg2Y29Rc0ZEZ0JjZzI5TTV4c2lpVGw4b3NtVzJQT01vRWRVT2lJQnlrN2luQnJQVDR1YVRkVm5wU18xSlUyMnM0QlZXYTNtbGk2eTJz</guid></item><item><title>Test Shows Alcohol Causing Long-Term Brain Damage - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9PbVE0ZGFKTkhEZFJZQXN4WFVBWkR0NzBPVnhVZnlWZFRZelllelE1NnVYWjQ3V19WTDVZVkU5QlRSRGZIZVZGTGhoUDBMZ0I1M0N6dk1IMWRMWVlyS2t3Rk8zemltVjg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new rat studies, scientists have found grim evidence of just how badly alcohol impairs cognition — even after sobering up months prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new, federally-funded research out of Johns Hopkins, the decision-making parts of the brain appear, even after months of sobriety, to be highly impacted by large amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in a new paper published in the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt0200" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hopkins neuroscientist and addiction researcher Patricia Janak and her students first exposed a cohort of rats to very high quantities of alcohol vapor, followed by a nearly three-month-long period of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After drying out, the rats that were given the booze vapor — along with a control group that had abstained — were subjected to a "reward-based decision-making test." The test involved pressing one of two levers to get a water droplet with some sugar in it — a simple task that rats learned how to do quickly to get their sweet treat. To complicate the game, however, the researchers would switch reward levers every few minutes, prompting the rats to figure out the timing of switches to get the reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy," noted a &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/04/02/how-alcohol-abuse-damages-cognition/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20Distinguished%20Professor-,%22We%20now%20have%20a%20new%20model%20for%20the%20unfortunate%20cognitive,studies%20the%20biology%20of%20addiction." class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement about the research&lt;/a&gt;. "The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers contend that their results are the first of their kind because prior alcohol studies that used animals did not "demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making" the way theirs did. This was likely due to the decision-making tests being too easy, the scientists claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our experiment was quite challenging, and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn't do it as well," Janak, the paper's first author, said in the Hopkins statement. "When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats' decision-related neural signals were stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team linked the alcohol-exposed rats' difficulties with the tests to "dramatic" changes in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain that governs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/dorsomedial-striatum" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3273324/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;behavioral decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. A known center for reward and expectations, the dorsomedial striatum has long been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00028/full" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;associated with addictive and compulsive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; — but this study seems to be the first to ever show just how much the neural circuits had been damaged by booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers indicated that they were surprised that the brain damage from alcohol lasted so long, which "may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high," Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab," the neuroscientist said. "We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the cognitive effects were only present in the male rats that were studied and not their female counterparts. While there's no reason to believe females aren't subject to alcohol-related brain damage, this finding suggests, per the Hopkins press release, that there "could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it does seem &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-dont-rats-get-the-same-ethical-protections-as-primates" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;kind of cruel&lt;/a&gt; to get rats so plastered that they suffer brain damage — especially when there are plenty of human alcoholics out there who would be willing to be studied. Still, these findings could be helpful in future addiction studies, and are fascinating to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on booze: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/man-builds-robot-force-alcohol" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Builds Robot to Force-Feed Him Alcohol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 12:15:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9PbVE0ZGFKTkhEZFJZQXN4WFVBWkR0NzBPVnhVZnlWZFRZelllelE1NnVYWjQ3V19WTDVZVkU5QlRSRGZIZVZGTGhoUDBMZ0I1M0N6dk1IMWRMWVlyS2t3Rk8zemltVjg</guid></item><item><title>Help!

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dqu39002j3572okzr07zz@published"&gt;While I was dating my college boyfriend, my sister started to date his brother. My relationship started getting rocky, and I had a choice between starting a new job in a different city or working on my relationship. My boyfriend was adamant that I not take the job and stay here with him. I made the mistake of staying. We broke up a year later because I found him cheating on me. My sister was still dating his brother and they ended up engaged. It was very difficult for me to be around my sister and her fiancé. After they got married, holidays were even worse. I struggled but moved on. Well, several years later, they are in the process of getting a divorce. And my brother-in-law just decided to nuke my relationship with my sister by sending me a taunting text containing a major shock.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dodx2004jr7m7ge3bis67@published"&gt;In it, he revealed his brother had been cheating on me a long time before I found out, and my sister knew all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

I screamed at her. She was the one that encouraged me to stay and skip my chance at a new job. I called her a selfish whore and said that I considered her dead to me now. In the aftermath, our parents are more upset at me for adding more stress to my sister than about what happened to me. They say it was years ago and that I am overreacting. This has me so sick that my doctor put me on anxiety medication. I don’t know how to go on from here.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not fair that your boyfriend cheated on you, and it’s even worse that your brother-in-law went out of his way to hurt you on his way out the door. I’ll be transparent about my agenda here: I don’t want this story to end with the two bad guy exes living happily ever after and enjoying each other’s company while you and you and your sister have to cope without each other. You say “My BIL decided to nuke my relationship with my sister” —but his whole plan fails if you don’t let him do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="224" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002s357292jmy4mx@published"&gt;Also, totally separate from my desire for a narrative in which the terrible men don’t come out on top, I think your relationship with your sister is worth saving. Yes, it’s fair to be upset with her, to wish she’d made a different choice with regard to telling you about the cheating, and to need some time to get over it. But her behavior doesn’t rise to “selfish whore who is dead to me” levels. People often write to me often asking for advice on whether to tell a loved one that their partner is being unfaithful. It’s a common dilemma because this is a situation in which it’s really hard to know what the victim of infidelity would want. While some are grateful for the intel, plenty of others become outraged at the deliverer of bad news. I’ve made the case before that when there is cheating, there are almost always clues and that person in the relationship could pursue if they truly wanted to know, so there’s no obligation to inform them. But whether to speak up is a legitimately tough call—one about which good, kind people can disagree. Sometimes I think we should get ahead of the issue by giving our friends and family instructions about whether we’d want to be informed if they ever suspected that our partners were cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7et002t3572pd02myan@published"&gt;What you’re experiencing is real pain and distress, and I would never agree that you’re overreacting or that the time that’s passed means you should be over it. But I suspect your response might be more about how much being cheated on all those years ago hurt you—and your shame over making a “mistake”— and less about what your sister knew and when. I hope the anti-anxiety medication is helping, and I wonder if it will give you the mental space to process what happened in your relationship, why you made the choice you did, and how you can forgive yourself for staying in a city with a guy who turned out not to be worth it. That’s a totally understandable (and extremely common) decision. And it’s worth noting that it did not ruin your life. I hope you can make peace with it and see it as part of your journey rather than something that derailed you completely. If you can do that, you may begin to see your sister is also someone who has made missteps but isn’t defined by them, and perhaps the two of you can figure out your next steps together.&lt;/p&gt;

A new neighbor came and was upset that I “touched his laundry and didn’t wait for him.” I thought maybe he didn’t realize normal etiquette and that I use a cane. He was still demanding an apology. I said write a note to the board. I refrained from saying he had poor manners. I don’t feel obligated to teach a grown, able man what entitlement is. Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev002z35722ucb2jl6@published"&gt;Your neighbor should know that if you use shared laundry facilities and don’t want anyone to touch your clothes, you need to either bring some work or entertainment and set up shop in the laundry room so you’re there when each load is done, or implement a very good alarm system to remind you to run down and grab your stuff. (If you’re waiting for a machine, it’s considerate to give the current user maybe five minutes after the buzzer to show up, but no longer.) That’s the rule! And even if he’s truly confused about how this works, he should have extended some empathy to you and the fact that you can’t comfortably stand around waiting for people to remember that they’re washing clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00303572m73qi66x@published"&gt;You were right and he was wrong. But forget the lesson on manners and entitlement. In the same way that we all have to be responsible for our own clothes and not our neighbors, his bad personality is his business, and it’s not your job to provide guidance on how to be a considerate human being. “Write a note to the board” (a polite way of saying “Take it up with someone who cares, and by the way, they’re not going to be on your side”) was the perfect response, and you should use it again if you find yourself in this situation in the future. But I suspect your neighbor’s horror at having his wet clothes touched might have been the reminder he needed to time his loads better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00333572y8knb4qg@published"&gt;I come to you fresh out of a nearly year-long relationship. I started dating “B” just shortly after coming out, and he was my first relationship. Things were peachy, save for a few disagreements here and there. When I say I’m fresh out of this relationship, it’s more “raw” than “minty.” It wasn’t my decision. My boyfriend, after months of sharing our personalities, time, and baggage, told me that his anxiety was making our relationship “suffocating” and that he would need to move on to take better care of his mental health. I had known about his anxiety and worked to foster an environment where he could feel honest about how he’s feeling and share whatever he felt comfortable with. The problem, however, is that he still held back. He said that he tried to sweep it under the rug throughout our relationship, but the kettle was boiling and he just couldn’t ignore the whistle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex003435727g0md1y3@published"&gt;The shock hit me like a silver bullet. How could the man I love decide to stumble out of a relationship rather than grant me the opportunity to talk though his pain? How do I even know if his intention to seek help was genuine? Was it really his anxiety that suffocated our relationship, or was it me? These questions and any number like them still own my mind over a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex00353572vr6bmmt3@published"&gt;Now, we’re no-contact and according to what little information I have available (through social media), he’s positively enjoying his relationship-free life. He leaves no sign of the anxiety that reportedly damned our relationship, and he certainly doesn’t let it get in the way of clubbing, concerts, and other fun outings. Is he just sweeping it under the rug again? Is there any hope of us reconnecting? And, if there is, will I just end up getting burned again?&lt;/p&gt;

People break up and make up all the time. But I encourage you not to pursue that. Block him on Instagram, and consider the relationship over. Forever. This advice is based on a few rules that I think apply to your situation:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00393572itbf2s62@published"&gt;- No-contact should include no following on social media (which, by the way, doesn’t provide an accurate representation of anyone’s mood or mental state).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003a35723t9o9gna@published"&gt;- People are allowed to break up with you with no due process, for reasons that aren’t fair or honest or don’t make sense or are based on their own weird stuff and poor choices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003b3572s70tbdra@published"&gt;- It’s a bad idea to chase someone who doesn’t want you.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003c3572gnao4a6f@published"&gt;I know it’s not as simple as simply deciding to be done, and when someone doesn’t hold up their end of the relationship or share their true feelings, it can feel disorienting, and even like an injustice. You’re allowed to hate the way things turned out between the two of you and be frustrated that he didn’t work harder to address his mental health and nurture his connection with you at the same time. Rant about it to your friends, invite them to rant about it back to you, journal, scream—do whatever you need to. Except trying to reconnect with him. Instead, try to tap into the part of you that was eager to be in an open, supportive, healthy relationship and start to think about looking for someone who wants the same and is willing to work as hard as you are to make it happen. After all, if you were so invested in a relationship with a guy who found it suffocating, imagine how much better it will be when you find someone for whom being your partner is &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I really do not want to be poly, and having kids in a few years (I’m 28 now, he is 30) is really important to me. But I feel regret and wonder if I should get back together with him and if this is just a big struggle we have to overcome. He is dating his crush already, and she is poly. Since he met her, he is convinced that being poly is the thing that will make him happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/dear-prudence-sexist-demand.html"&gt;Should I try to fight for us? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet is filled with foods that can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians’ top Mediterranean diet weight-loss foods are lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods are rich in nutrients that help with weight management, like protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;has long been celebrated as one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. So, it’s no surprise that it’s also linked to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This diet emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods like fresh produce, hearty whole grains, beans, healthy fats and small amounts of lean protein. And it’s low in added sugars, red meat and highly processed foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike restrictive diets that may feel unsustainable, the Mediterranean diet is more of a lifestyle approach, focusing on balance and enjoyment. That, in turn, may make it easier to stick with over time. What makes this diet even more appealing for weight management is its sheer variety of healthy, satisfying foods that naturally help you eat less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, there are lots of foods to choose from. So, we asked dietitians which Mediterranean diet foods stand out for weight loss. Here are their five favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-lentils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Lentils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a versatile, nutritious food to incorporate into your meals, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; are an outstanding choice. What makes them so powerful for weight loss? “Lentils are an excellent source of plant-based protein, and they are high in fiber, both nutrients that help keep you satiated and keep blood sugar levels stable,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicalevinson.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jessica Levinson, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary nutrition expert in Westchester, New York. One cup of cooked lentils has 16 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Combined, these may help reduce overall caloric intake, thereby promoting weight loss, says Levinson. For instance, one study found that people who ate more legumes, like lentils, had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines and were less likely to gain weight over 10 years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for ways to add more of these mighty legumes to your diet, think soup. Whether it’s our Mediterranean-inspired &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7938176/red-lentil-soup-with-saffron/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Red Lentil Soup with Saffron&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250654/slow-cooker-spiced-lentil-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Slow-Cooker Spiced Lentil Soup with Vegetables&lt;/a&gt; or this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7873875/vegan-weight-loss-lentil-soup/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Vegan Weight-Loss Lentil Soup&lt;/a&gt;, a nourishing bowl of protein- and fiber-rich soup will keep you full and satisfied.

This thick, creamy dairy product is made by straining regular yogurt to remove excess whey, resulting in a concentrated protein content. One single-serve 5.6-ounce container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt provides an impressive 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That protein helps with weight loss in multiple ways, such as reducing appetite and increasing calorie-burning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The probiotics in Greek yogurt also improve gut health, which is increasingly linked to better weight regulation and reduced inflammation,” explains Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No wonder research has found that yogurt, as part of a balanced and healthy diet, may help prevent and manage obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

In fact, one study found that healthy-weight adults living in the U.K. were more likely to consume chickpeas than people living with overweight or obesity. And they had healthier diets, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to wholesome and convenient Mediterranean diet–friendly snacks, few foods are as satisfying and nutritious as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;. “Nuts, like almonds and walnuts, are an essential Mediterranean diet food to have on hand,” says &lt;a href="http://www.inutritioncenter.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Integrated Nutrition for Weight Loss. “They’re packed with healthy fats, fiber and protein to help you stay full longer, making them a great snack for weight management.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re worried about their fat, you can relax. Evidence finds that even though nuts are high in fat, eating them doesn’t lead to weight gain. Instead, the opposite is true.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole fruits and vegetables are the foundations of the Mediterranean diet. While all produce is a win for weight loss, green leafy vegetables have decided benefits. Leafy greens, like spinach, kale and Swiss chard, are naturally low in calories, rich in fiber and high in volume. So, they fill you up with negligible calories. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spinach is, perhaps, the most noteworthy leafy green in the Mediterranean diet. With a mere 7 calories per cup, this satisfying green provides fiber, iron, vitamin C and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, spinach contains compounds called thylakoids that may also support weight management by helping the body use insulin more effectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet offers a sustainable, enjoyable, nutrient-dense approach to healthy eating and weight management. By including a variety of wholesome foods like lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and green leafy vegetables like spinach, you can create satisfying meals that support your health goals while celebrating the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean region. That said, there are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of foods to choose from. If you’re new to the Mediterranean diet, start small by incorporating a few of these foods into your daily meals and experience how delicious and nutritious eating can truly be.

So, once again, not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is fiber?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber comes from whole fruits and vegetables, which most people under-consume, Mullins said. Additionally, many folks turn to white flour, white bread and white rice instead of their whole-grain alternatives, and fiber is stripped when companies make these white-flour versions, said Elnakib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is the part of the food that we don’t normally digest, so humans can’t digest this part of the food, and so it’s often in plant-based foods,” Elnakib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s two kinds of fiber, she explained. Soluble fiber can be dissolved in water, “and basically that part of the fiber creates kind of like a gel-like substance when you eat it and it’s in your gut,” Elnakib said. “That actually pulls all of the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/high-cholesterol" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/high-cholesterol" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, the fat and the sugars in your gut so they don’t enter your bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other kind of fiber is insoluble fiber, which is “that other part of the food that we cannot digest ... Think about the skin of an apple or a blueberry skin,” Elnakib said. “What they do is really just create bulk in our stool and soften our stool so that we have easier bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to eat enough fiber every day ― and you’re likely not getting the recommended amount. Below, experts share the signs that you’re not eating enough fiber and explain how to add more of it to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You’re regularly constipated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number one sign that someone has an inadequate fiber intake is constipation,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lon Ben-Asher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Lon Ben-Asher&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Pritikin Longevity Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inadequate fiber intake makes it a lot more difficult for stool to pass through the GI tract, and it creates more infrequent bowel movements,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, fiber helps add bulk to the stool, which in turn “helps food pass through the gastrointestinal tract a lot easier,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You get hungry again soon after a meal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the signs that you may not be consuming enough fiber is if you feel hungry shortly after eating,” Mullins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because you’re eating foods, such as sugars and refined carbs, that are absorbed quickly, she said. “One of the great benefits of fiber... is that it really helps to make you feel full and to feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because fiber isn’t very digestible, it can kind of sit in our stomach for a while and slow down the absorption of other nutrients, which is one of the ways that it helps to regulate blood sugar,” Mullins noted. “But what this also does is helps us to feel full and feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You have stomach discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign you aren’t eating enough fiber?

Instead of eating ultra-processed carbs, opt for items you can pick from a garden, such as sweet potatoes and beans, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And instead of eating white bread or white rice, choose breads and grains that are whole-grain, Elnakib said. But be careful not to just pick out bread or grain that’s dyed brown, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re looking at whole-grain products, actually look at the back and make sure that it is made from whole grain versus just brown products because that’s not always the same,” Elnakib explained. Make sure you’re “looking at the back and you’re checking to see that it says ‘whole grain flour’ or ‘whole grain sorghum wheat’ or pasta or whatever it is that you’re using ... Multi-grain is great, too, because then you get different kinds of whole grains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber supplements can be helpful, but they aren’t the same as fiber-rich food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may be easy to take a dietary fiber pill or powder, it’s not necessarily as effective as eating fiber from a plant source, Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think in certain situations, taking a supplement can be effective and helpful to certain people,” he said. “But the science and the research and the evidence-based literature does not support that getting fiber from a supplemental source has the same impact on our health as consuming fiber from real whole plant foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to the store to pick up a fiber supplement, spend that time looking up &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber-packed recipes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;fiber-packed recipes&lt;/a&gt; like bean salads, chili, split pea soup, whole wheat pasta with veggies and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important for people really to try to focus a little bit more on their dietary approach and adding fiber from food, as opposed to from a lot of the supplements that people take,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re concerned about your fiber intake, consider talking to a dietitian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to cooking the same low-fiber meals, it can feel overwhelming to make the switch.

But for infectious disease specialists like Peter Chin-Hong, one of the most insidious threats lurking in &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care"&gt;hospitals and clinics&lt;/a&gt; today is fungal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Chin-Hong’s case list is long: a healthy 29-year-old marathon runner from California’s Central Valley whose heart lining was invaded by Coccidioides, a soil-dwelling fungus; a lung transplant recipient coughing up mold nodules - fungal growths scattered throughout his lungs - after stopping antifungal medication; and a 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, infected by a black fungus that destroyed part of her face and spread to her brain. Despite multiple surgeries and treatment, she died in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“These aren’t rare anymore,” said Chin-Hong, associate dean and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “We’re seeing them every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Once considered obscure or opportunistic, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2023/03/22/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate-in-the-us-heres-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2023/03/22/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate-in-the-us-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;invasive fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are now surfacing with alarming frequency - and in patients and places doctors never used to worry about. Climate change is expanding the geographic reach of fungi. Medical advances like organ transplants, chemotherapy, and intensive care are saving lives, but they also leave more patients immunocompromised. Even common conditions like diabetes raise the risk of severe fungal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Business Briefing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Become a business insider with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;An estimated 6.5 million people develop invasive fungal infections each year, with about 2.5 million deaths directly caused by them — roughly twice the global toll of tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Many of those deaths are in people with advanced HIV, and experts warn the problem may worsen as funding for global HIV/AIDS programs is pulled back. A surge in AIDS-related illness, they say, could turbocharge the fungal crisis, especially in low-resource settings where diagnostic tools and antifungal treatments are already limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Adding to the danger is the rise of drug-resistant infections - strains that no longer respond to the limited arsenal of antifungal medications. Candida auris, a newly emerging yeast first seen in 2009, has already triggered deadly outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Experts warn that broader resistance could soon outpace the slow development of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Fungal Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections"&gt;critical global gaps in the ability to diagnose and treat fungal infections&lt;/a&gt;. That includes the dangerously thin pipeline of medicines, with just four new antifungals approved globally over the past decade. Of the nine currently in clinical development, only three have reached the final stage of patient studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We can expect few new approvals in the next 10 years,” said Valeria Gigante, who leads the antimicrobial resistance division at WHO in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;More than half of the antifungal candidates in development lack true innovation, limiting their ability to counter emerging resistance, Gigante added. “We always need new ways to kill dangerous fungi,” she said. “Only three of the nine candidates even target the most critical pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/"&gt;Fungal threats&lt;/a&gt; have remained dangerously overlooked, said Justin Beardsley, an infectious diseases doctor and University of Sydney researcher who contributed to both WHO reports. “Fungus is not on anybody’s radar,” he said. “It’s unobserved and out of control — which means we’re not developing mitigations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;He also pointed to growing concern over agricultural antifungal use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of the new drugs being developed don’t have a novel mechanism of action,” Beardsley said. And in many cases, new compounds are introduced faster in agriculture to protect crops from diseases like powdery mildew. “That is just really disheartening for human drug developers — and a little bit worrying for public health, that our new-hope drugs are already going to be getting exposed to a biosimilar agent in the environment and we’re going to get resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Another shortcoming is around diagnostics, with the WHO cautioning that even when tests exist to identify deadly fungi, they’re often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. Most rely on well-equipped laboratories and trained personnel. The development of systems to detect invasive fungal infections and determine drug susceptibility is also lagging behind what exists for bacteria, Gigante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Unseen Foe&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Fungal infections behave differently from bacteria and viruses. They rarely spread person to person. Instead, most come from the environment - moldy soil, decaying plants, airborne spores. Some spores can even travel high into the atmosphere and drift across continents, making them especially hard to track or control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;That makes it nearly impossible to fully protect vulnerable patients. UCSF’s Chin-Hong said doctors often prescribe preventive antifungal medication to people at high risk, such as those who’ve had lung or blood stem cell transplants. But the drugs don’t cover every type of mold. Mucormycosis — a rare but aggressive infection - is notoriously difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article id="related-story-embed-YR4KYD3PFFH4JP6NHVIGUU5K2M" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"&gt;&lt;label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark"&gt;Related:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/"&gt;Superbug infections, deaths rose at beginning of pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Mucormycosis is probably the scariest one we have,” Chin-Hong said. “If it gets into the lungs, the death rate can be as high as 87%.” The fungus can also invade the sinuses and spread to the brain, with a mortality rate around 50%. It causes tissue to die - cutting off blood flow so antifungal drugs can’t reach the infection site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“You have to surgically remove the infected area,” he said. “A lot of times people have their eye taken out because it goes up through the sinus cavity, and there’s no good treatment for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Resection - surgically removing infected tissue - is sometimes possible in the sinuses or skin. But in the lungs, it’s often far more difficult. “The reason lung mortality is so high is because you can’t just cut out big chunks of lung,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And even when drugs work, they’re often less effective in the very patients who need them most — those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We have agents now,” Chin-Hong said, “but we’re running out of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Jason Gale, Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__bZ-w3 py-5 px-7 border border-gray-light my-8 clear-both"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block pr-8 shrink-0 w-auto flex flex-col" href="/news/public-health/2025/04/05/plan-to-cover-anti-obesity-drugs-through-medicare-is-dropped/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__6H-hI dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/JIUFXZFZ2RO57J2XPKZ6XYL6VQ.jpg?auth=3ef4b555ef236fd6eb1c2e6d5941b109f0b8f7cf282bd9cc80f1a2afda392925&amp;amp;height=127&amp;amp;width=190&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Wegovy is a drug used for weight loss.

The primary side effects are dry skin and mild irritation, and the treatment boasts “no nit-combing required.” Dracker said the efficacy rate of the prescription treatment is “nearly 100%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVAIWTL47VBOZANRYPFRO6DT54"&gt;Dr. Debra Jaliman, a New York City-based dermatologist, also frequently encounters super lice at her practice. Jaliman recommends that patients see a board-certified dermatologist for a proper diagnosis, as an itchy scalp “can be caused by seborrheic dermatitis, an allergic reaction or even dry skin.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2VQADM7SB5AHJPLSN347SZEW74"&gt;Jaliman said that patients may start over-the-counter treatments, like Rid or Nix, before seeking a prescription. She also stresses the importance of washing brushes, combs, hair accessories, bedding and linen in hot water, as well as vacuuming all upholstery and carpets around the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y6XM45MZWRCLPH3RCQVMA7J62Y"&gt;If a patient needs a prescription treatment, Jaliman said she opts for ivermectin or malathion. She has not used Natroba. Ivermectin can be taken orally as a pill and repeated a week after to ensure the lice are removed. Though it is not FDA-approved to treat lice specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0905471#:~:text=In%20the%20per%2Dprotocol%20population,11.8%3B%20P%3D0.002" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies have shown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the efficacy rate in lice removal is over 90%.

Do your tick checks. Know when your risk is highest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus is primarily transmitted to humans by one of Minnesota’s 13 tick species: the blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick. Symptoms of Powassan include seizures, paralysis, speech difficulties and, in severe infections, meningitis and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 10% to 15% of Powassan virus cases are fatal, and around half of infected individuals sustain long-term neurological problems such as recurring headaches and memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no treatments or vaccines for Powassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It replicates in neurons, and it replicates in cells that are in brain cells, and so through simple destructive processes in the brain, you’re going to have downstream effects that result in these long-term cognitive impacts,” said Matthew Aliota, professor at the University of Minnesota Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences. “Powassan has the capacity to invade the central nervous system, to cross the blood/brain barrier and to infect brain cells, and that can have really bad long-term consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aliota received a $3.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in 2024 to assess the potential public risk of and build a foundational understanding of Powassan, focusing on Minnesota and New York — two of the country’s Powassan epicenters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 54 human cases across 10 states in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This really has been an understudied virus to date, and the number of cases have been increasing over the past, say, 10 to 15 years,” he said. “Some of this is related to better recognition by clinicians, but some of it I think is just ecology as well, a true increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan is often compared to Lyme disease because both are spread by blacklegged ticks, but Aliota says the two are “apples to oranges.” Lyme disease is significantly more common than Powassan and is not a virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_11666608" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="A red rash on a woman's arm." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="11666608" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Undated courtesy photo, circa 2007, of the pathognomonic erythematous rash in the pattern of a bull’s-eye, referred to as erythema migrans. The rash manifested at the site of a tick bite, on this Maryland woman’s arm, signifying a case of Lyme disease. (James Gathany/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is spread by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacteria a tick acquires when feeding on white-footed mice. These comparisons have led some to believe — possibly incorrectly — that the white-footed mouse is also a reservoir for Powassan. It is unknown which tick host animal harbors Powassan; some ticks are also born with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have just assumed that that mouse is the same host for Powassan as well, but we don’t know that,” Aliota said. “That’s one of the questions that my lab is trying to answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for increasing Powassan reports may include more abundant animals for ticks to prey on: white-tailed deer, a favorite host of the blacklegged tick, have larger numbers in the state than in past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, more people may live near deer ticks than compared to a few decades ago. As housing developments are built and expanded, more people encroach on tick habitats. Many suburbs have wooded pockets on their edges, and these forest fragments place ticks close to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It kind of creates this ideal habitat for encounters between humans and this tick species,” Aliota said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase awareness of Powassan, Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologists like Schiffman frequently give presentations to inform health care providers, medical associations and the public about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s about hammering home that messaging like, ‘Well, when we talk about tick-borne diseases, it’s more than just Lyme disease,’” she said. “We talk with providers, ‘Here’s how you find these rare cases, and if you have a person who you can’t figure out what they have, please loop us in at MVH, we’d love to help you sort out what might be causing that person’s illness.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who exhibit mild or no symptoms are less likely to seek testing, and for patients who are tested, the virus’ rarity may lead some doctors to overlook the possibility of Powassan. Most diagnostic labs in the state are unable to screen for Powassan, meaning doctors must send blood work to places like Mayo Clinic or the Minnesota Department of Health for detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with the way that we capture these cases and the way we do surveillance, we’re kind of biased towards the more severe cases,” Schiffman said. “We’re probably missing some of the milder ones, just as an artifact of how that testing is done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bias may extend to the age demographics of infected individuals. More than 70% of cases reported nationally within the past two decades occurred in people age 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also tend to see a lot of people who are older and who have those immunosuppressive conditions in our case population that we report on because they’re also more likely to be the ones who get sicker,” Schiffman said. “If you’re sicker, you’re probably more likely to be tested. So you’re definitely biasing the data in that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health recommends being aware of areas at high risk of tick activity, using Environmental Protection Agency-registered tick repellent (&lt;a href="http://epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you&lt;/a&gt;) and diligently checking the skin and clothing after outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

While some of these microbes cause illness and disease (such as bacteria and viruses), others are friendlier to us and help keep us in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is one of these friendly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for years that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is associated with good health. One of the important roles it plays in our gut is maintaining the function of our gut barrier. This keeps the bad bugs out while making sure we can still absorb the important nutrients from our diet that keep our cells working as they should. But when there’s an imbalance of &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in the gut, it can lead to problems with our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual bacteria lives in our large intestine and survives off of mucin — the layer of mucus that covers the large intestine’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucin provides a small but important separation between the human cells and microbial cells that call the large intestine home. If this mucus layer is disrupted, microbes can come into direct contact with the human cells. This may result in inflammation as the human cells react to the bacteria – potentially leading to the development of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is a very fussy eater. It only uses the glycoproteins (molecules containing protein and carbohydrates) in mucin as an energy source. But just how this bacteria extracted energy from glycoproteins was a mystery until recently. Research conducted by myself and colleagues discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; deploys a range of different enzymes that work together in order to unlock the sugar found in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mucin taken from a pig, we analysed both enzyme activity on the surface of cells alongside their genes to understand which enzymes were involved in breaking the glycoproteins in mucin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; uses 66 different enzymes to extract the important energy it needs from the glycoproteins in order to do its important work. We are the first group to describe this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Important for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila’s&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the immune system in mice have revealed that it calms the immune system down and may prevent obesity and diabetes from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have highlighted specific peptides (a type of molecule) that it secretes which have this effect on the immune system. Due to its friendly nature and calming effect on the immune system, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; has even been used to develop probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also found that people who have a metabolic disease, such as diabetes or fatty liver disease, have fewer &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in their large intestine. The more lean and athletic you are, the more &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; only eats mucus, our diet does still affect it – though indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon-dwelling bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; use the carbohydrates they extract from the fibre-rich foods in our diet as fuel. In return they produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These compounds feed the top layer of human cells in the colon. In fact, 10 per cent of our energy comes from this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hHPRtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The bacteria lives in the large intestine" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-4345"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;The bacteria lives in the large intestine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; also supports other bacterial species in the microbiome by giving them broken-up mucus so they can survive – a process known as “cross feeding”. But, if we don’t eat enough fibre as part of our diet, mucins become a much more heavily used source of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to the depletion of the large intestine’s mucus layer – throwing the microbiome’s delicate ecosystem out of balance. This increases the chance of developing inflammatory diseases. So, although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is not a pathogen, it can remove too much mucus under the wrong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research is the first complete example of how mucus is broken down by this bacterial species. It’s important to understand this process, as it’s key in the way our microbes interact with each other – and with us. The enzymes that we described from &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; can now also be used as tools to analyse how these complex mucin structures vary across different body sites and between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more researchers learn about &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; and the other microbes that live in the colon, the more we understand the importance of eating a variable, high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Crouch is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection, Department of Microbes, Infection and Microbiomes, School of Infection, Inflammation and Immunology, College of Medicine and Health at University of Birmingham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Other vitamin A derivatives like retinol are weaker because your skin must convert them before they’re recognizable as retinoic acid. Tretinoin’s strength translates into glowier, healthier-looking skin faster, but the ingredient is not without its weaknesses. “Tretinoin often causes dryness, peeling, and redness due to increased skin-cell turnover,” says double-board-certified facial plastic surgeon &lt;a data-offer-url="https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/"}' href="https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Babak Azizzadeh&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people wrongly think they are allergic or stop using it for these reasons.” These side effects are often known as the retinoid uglies, and they can be challenging, but they’re not insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to succeeding when using all-star all-trans retinoic acid is consistency, patience, and caution—and following a tretinoin skin-care routine designed to support your skin as it adjusts to the potent active. With these steps and our expert tips, you’ll be well on your way to revealing your freshest, brightest skin yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your Evening Tretinoin Skin-Care Routine Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretinoin can make your skin more sensitive, especially to sun exposure, so you’ll want to apply it as part of your evening routine. Dr. Reszko recommends following an evening routine focusing on repair, hydration, and supporting the skin’s overnight regenerative processes. “Combining tretinoin with growth factors, reparative ingredients, and gentle hydration will help restore the skin barrier, minimize irritation, and promote healthy skin renewal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Prep the Skin With Cleanser&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always start with a fresh canvas. By washing your face, you’ll be removing any makeup, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-sunscreens"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, or other residues that will prevent the tretinoin from fully absorbing into your skin. Our experts recommend using a gentle, hydrating formula that won’t strip the skin barrier and leave you dry but fully removes any grime. Ideally, it’ll also be fragrance-free to avoid irritation; you’ll want your skin to be as comfortable as possible before applying tretinoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK dlcjCj grid

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a Pea-Size Amount of Tretinoin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve patted your skin dry post-cleanse, apply a pea-size amount of tretinoin to your face, avoiding your eyes, mouth, and any broken skin. A pea-size amount may sound like a comically small dab of product, but we promise that is truly all you need to get the benefits of tretinoin. “Be careful not to over-apply, as more product doesn’t necessarily mean better results,” warns Dr. Reszko. Allow the tretinoin to absorb for a few minutes before you move on to the next step, which will give it time to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a Skin-Renewing Serum&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’re getting your beauty rest, your body is hard at work fixing any damage from the day. Make the most of it by using a repair serum after your tretinoin. A product like this will support the work of your retinoid by further promoting skin renewal while also helping to soothe any irritation or sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK dlcjCj grid grid-even grid-items-2 GroupCalloutWrapper-bPWknp hzPUPi callout callout--group callout--group-2"&gt;&lt;div class="GridItem-buujkM dEqBaI grid--item"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/5K8RQcJwUJf9wsD3Pt5Avb1LktRTmn3sj5HNaE7ig4g22Yb2Rg9ZsCWp94xkAvdvTcs38HX6Q5YegWbn9JLMFjpb36Z5y29vg39U74wgJS9rCJtkN4iKJojRAB7aE4YbjAzawFb8Yq5S6A3dvKFPyHx1GhZiD6yxj92CJTXgt7Vt5fDZdkeHLkTzYfg9GWtNMuv2QBNMrQkAZxpZXHgbaj1z53SEr8YxU7kanvHKF4ZxcRpwwDtf4LF59vmgWmt4tVzLwAvUuLuFiwdg","dangerousDek":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This lightweight yet surprisingly nourishing serum is packed with peptides that act like your skin’s natural growth factors to stimulate new collagen production as well as anti-inflammatory niacinamide, fatty-acid-rich evening primrose oil, and lipids derived from hardy oats grown near the arctic circle for added reparative benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n","productBrand":"Nocturnal","dangerousHed":"Polar Night Renewal Serum","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NOCTURNAL","offerUrl":"https://go.linkby.com/TXEZKXAE/products/polar-night-renewal-serum","contentType":"product","productId":"67ed48e71a95bf5eb5c2141c","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":4,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67ed48e71a95bf5eb5c2141c","brand":{"name":"Nocturnal"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://go.linkby.com/TXEZKXAE/products/polar-night-renewal-serum","price":"$178","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/5K8RQcJwUJf9wsD3Pt5Avb1LktRTmn3sj5HNaE7ig4g22Yb2Rg9ZsCWp94xkAvdvTcs38HX6Q5YegWbn9JLMFjpb36Z5y29vg39U74wgJS9rCJtkN4iKJojRAB7aE4YbjAzawFb8Yq5S6A3dvKFPyHx1GhZiD6yxj92CJTXgt7Vt5fDZdkeHLkTzYfg9GWtNMuv2QBNMrQkAZxpZXHgbaj1z53SEr8YxU7kanvHKF4ZxcRpwwDtf4LF59vmgWmt4tVzLwAvUuLuFiwdg","sellerName":"NOCTURNAL","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67ed48e71a95bf5eb5c2141c" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Polar Night Renewal Serum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardDescriptionWrapper-dDTcJP iUEiRd dIcbna hHSuFw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lightweight yet surprisingly nourishing serum is packed with peptides that act like your skin’s natural growth factors to stimulate new collagen production as well as anti-inflammatory niacinamide, fatty-acid-rich evening primrose oil, and lipids derived from hardy oats grown near the arctic circle for added reparative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter your reason for using a retinoid, don’t have it in your regimen if you’re not going to use sunscreen too. “Sun protection is crucial while using tretinoin since it increases sun sensitivity and makes your skin more prone to burning and damage,” warns Dr. Reszko, who recommends seeking out a broad-spectrum formula (which will protect you from both UVA and UVB rays) that’s at least SPF 30, if not greater for added protection. Dr. Azizzadeh recommends mineral SPF in particular, as it’s gentler on the skin than chemical filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK dlcjCj grid grid-even grid-items-2 GroupCalloutWrapper-bPWknp hzPUPi callout callout--group callout--group-2"&gt;&lt;div class="GridItem-buujkM dEqBaI grid--item"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/ABAm9JTY78wqUMwcwcSjpMWCTdk3MJnSPww1XrDm7dTh9Efg6fBAFzC72kJuhAg4Ca7PkwAjhRPabrmvipZ4Gz2SEA5yBnMWAmszBRgshHH5WCcoAb4jgiea2jSZCd6wtYPkbJ2RNMmb3Yr1Xk3xi7xx1QPAJtkPMQCqYooMG4KQZvyCwGKNaijXXKBLqRZwFr9sMLc5t6McYZpEysK8v2d76WHpsYzQeSxjY1HfG4stsxcDGyBLvrYq1mZhud7mieZ1MgtrZxRHfMkGRnGip4i3JwqQ1YSBEMW23BWF5Wa7DE9m1pbme2WwPK4SpDo7HzKfG9RTi8SvD4Nr","dangerousDek":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This &amp;lt;a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/best-tinted-sunscreen\"&amp;gt;tinted mineral SPF formula&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; automatically adjusts to your skin tone, offering dewy coverage that’s comparable to a light-to-medium buildable foundation while treating your skin to soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide, bisabolol, and green-tea extract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n","productBrand":"Skinbetter","dangerousHed":"Sunbetter Tone Smart SPF 75 Sunscreen Lotion","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"SKINBETTER","offerUrl":"https://www.skinbetter.com/technology-platforms/sunbetter/sunbetter-tone-smart-spf-75-sunscreen-lotion-M025.html","contentType":"product","productId":"67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":14,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e","brand":{"name":"Skinbetter"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.skinbetter.com/technology-platforms/sunbetter/sunbetter-tone-smart-spf-75-sunscreen-lotion-M025.html","price":"$75","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/ABAm9JTY78wqUMwcwcSjpMWCTdk3MJnSPww1XrDm7dTh9Efg6fBAFzC72kJuhAg4Ca7PkwAjhRPabrmvipZ4Gz2SEA5yBnMWAmszBRgshHH5WCcoAb4jgiea2jSZCd6wtYPkbJ2RNMmb3Yr1Xk3xi7xx1QPAJtkPMQCqYooMG4KQZvyCwGKNaijXXKBLqRZwFr9sMLc5t6McYZpEysK8v2d76WHpsYzQeSxjY1HfG4stsxcDGyBLvrYq1mZhud7mieZ1MgtrZxRHfMkGRnGip4i3JwqQ1YSBEMW23BWF5Wa7DE9m1pbme2WwPK4SpDo7HzKfG9RTi8SvD4Nr","sellerName":"SKINBETTER","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Skinbetter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Sunbetter Tone Smart SPF 75 Sunscreen Lotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardDescriptionWrapper-dDTcJP iUEiRd dIcbna hHSuFw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-tinted-sunscreen"&gt;tinted mineral SPF formula&lt;/a&gt; automatically adjusts to your skin tone, offering dewy coverage that’s comparable to a light-to-medium buildable foundation while treating your skin to soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide, bisabolol, and green-tea extract.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re new to retinoids and/or have sensitive skin, start with a low concentration, ideally with a cream base. A lower potency and a more nourishing base will help your skin adjust to the tretinoin and minimize the common side effects of irritation, dryness, redness, and peeling. “If you have dry or sensitive skin, your physician will likely recommend staying with a lower concentration,” says Dr. Azizzadeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use a 0.025% tretinoin without irritation for four or six weeks, have oily skin, or are a seasoned retinoid user, you can try a stronger formula; 0.05% will provide stronger antiaging and acne-clearing results, while 0.1% tretinoin will provide even more powerful benefits against deeper wrinkles or severe acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to monitor your skin as you start a new formula, advises Dr. Reszko. “If you notice irritation or excessive dryness, you may need to reduce the frequency or go back to a lower concentration for a while before moving up again,” she says. “The goal is to maximize benefits while keeping side effects to a minimum.” No matter what, side effects are likely, but don’t let that deter you; just take them as a sign you need to adjust your treatment, either in strength, application cadence (more on this below), or both. “You’re using a real prescription treatment,” says Dr. Bottiglione. “Education about the product you’re using is extremely important so you can learn how to modify the treatment to suit you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="beforeorafter" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do You Apply Tretinoin Before or After Moisturizer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will depend on your skin type as well as your tolerance to tretinoin. “If you apply a moisturizer first then put the tretinoin on, the moisturizer will act as a barrier and you will not get the full results from the treatment,” warns Dr. Bottiglione. However, creating a buffer can be helpful if you have dry or sensitive skin, says Dr. Azizzadeh, who advises these skin types to try the retinoin-sandwich technique: two thin layers of moisturizer as the bread, filled with tretinoin. You’ll still absorb some of the tretinoin, but you won’t be getting it at its maximum strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="notlayer" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Should You Not Layer With Tretinoin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretinoin sensitizes the skin, so you’ll want to avoid ingredients and products that can cause further irritation. This includes strong exfoliants like AHAs, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-bha-exfoliants"&gt;BHAs&lt;/a&gt;, and physical scrubs; potent actives such as benzoyl peroxide, hydroquinone, and kojic acid; and harsh or drying ingredients like alcohol-based astringents, toners, and clay masks, says Dr. Azizzadeh. You also shouldn’t use other retinoids (including &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-bakuchiol-serums"&gt;bakuchiol&lt;/a&gt;) with tretinoin; this will just add irritation without additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still keep exfoliants or other actives in your regimen using tretinoin. “You can use tretinoin and strong exfoliants on alternating nights,” says Dr. Azizzadeh. “Similarly, potent actives can be used on the same day as tretinoin, with the active ingredients applied in the morning and tretinoin in the evening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="howoften" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Often Should You Use Tretinoin per Week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less really is more with tretinoin, especially if you’re a new user. “Begin by applying tretinoin two to three nights a week for the first two to four weeks,” says Dr. Reszko. “This allows your skin to build tolerance while still reaping the benefits of increased cell turnover.” If your skin has adapted after a few weeks and you no longer have much irritation, you can increase your application to every other night or four to five times a week. Those with sensitive, reactive, or rosacea-prone skin should be especially aware of irritation. “If you notice irritation or dryness when you increase the frequency, reduce it back to two to three times a week until your skin fully adjusts,” says Dr. Reszko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently clear, smooth, and irritation-free skin while using tretinoin is a sign that you can take things to the next level. “If you are an advanced user and your skin fully tolerates tretinoin, you can apply it every night to maximize its benefits for acne, antiaging, and skin-texture improvement,” says Dr. Azzizadeh. Just be aware that your skin won’t be ready for this overnight; patiently building your skin’s tolerance is key to achieving the best results with the least irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meettheexperts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE55anV1OS1YdXB1LWNGVGhUTkVNdWZyaGxiUmcxWFVtNHdVZl9fekVVcHVwbTNtWmNpeW9od3JtcEZ6VGlhbDRwMmhrNVV3UXc1TUVyZU1hLUc3RnZxSFhINVR2RnJKdzQ</guid></item><item><title>I spent 3 nights in a secluded lodge in Italy's Dolomites.

We could call room service when hungry and spend the day admiring the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was tempting, but we headed downstairs to explore the spa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we considered never leaving the suite, exiting the spa was even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the 21,500-square-foot spa was the most impressive pool I've ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the pool had views of the Dolomites. Half of it was indoors, and the other was outdoors. Guests could swim between the two through sliding glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area also had loungers, daybeds, a water station with small snacks, a sauna, and a steam room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallway led to another wing of the spa, which had two more indoor saunas, one at 185 degrees Fahrenheit and another at 158 degrees. There was a cold plunge, a silent room with a fireplace, and a tea lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A door led outdoors to the fifth sauna, which was tucked inside a traditional South Tyrolean wooden house, and a second outdoor cold plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While access to these amenities is included in the stay, the property's spa also offers treatments like massages, facials, scrubs, and manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When she saw photos of the characteristic red rash on practice board exams, she flipped back through her textbooks to figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Most practicing doctors, in today’s day and age, are not going to see it in real life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in the past few months, Dr. Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, has treated about 20 people with measles. She is likely to see more cases, as a raging outbreak that has infected 481 people in Texas and killed one child continues to spread. In Texas, New Mexico and other parts of the country where cases have emerged,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;health care workers like Dr. Myrick are confronting the highly contagious virus for the first time. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported 607 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. this year — more than double the number of cases seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The generation of physicians who are currently, for the most part, treating patients haven’t actually seen what a measles case looks like other than from a textbook or a video,” said Dr. Andy Lubell, chief medical officer of True North Pediatrics in Pennsylvania, where a physician diagnosed the practice’s first ever measles case this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000. Cases still pop up around the country each year, sometimes seeding larger outbreaks. But public health experts worry that this year, measles could become &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/health/measles-outbreak-texas.html" title=""&gt;more common in more places.&lt;/a&gt; The virus is spreading rapidly in some parts of the country, and vaccination rates nationwide have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" title=""&gt;been falling for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I remember learning about measles, German measles, all these things,” said Dr. Seth Coombs, a doctor at the Lovington Medical Clinic in New Mexico who saw his first measles case this year. “But you just don’t see them. And so like anything, if you don’t use it, you lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can sometimes be hard to recognize at first, especially if a doctor doesn’t think to look for it. The infection causes a telltale red rash, but it can take days to appear. Before that, someone with measles might have only a fever, cough, a runny nose and red, watery eyes — symptoms that mimic the signs of many other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of New Mexico researchers studying the health risks posed by gadolinium, a toxic rare earth metal used in MRI scans, have found that oxalic acid, a molecule found in many foods, can generate nanoparticles of the metal in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/i&gt;, a team led by Brent Wagner, MD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine in the UNM School of Medicine, sought to explain the formation of the nanoparticles, which have been associated with serious health problems in the kidneys and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The worst disease caused by MRI contrast agents is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," he said. "People have succumbed after just a single dose." The condition can cause a thickening and hardening of the skin, heart and lungs and cause painful contracture of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected prior to MRI scans to help create sharper images, Wagner said. The metal is usually tightly bound to other molecules and is excreted from the body, and most people experience no adverse effects. However, previous research has shown that even in those with no symptoms, gadolinium particles have been found in the kidney and the brain and can be detected in the blood and urine years after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are left with intertwined puzzles: Why do some people get sick, when most don't, and how do gadolinium particles become pried loose from the other molecules in the contrast agent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost 50% of the patients had been exposed only a single time, which means that there's something that is amplifying the disease signal," Wagner said. "This nanoparticle formation might explain a few things. It might explain why there's such an amplification of the disease. When a cell is trying to deal with this alien metallic nanoparticle within it, it's going to send out signals that tell the body to respond to it."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In their study, Wagner's team focused on oxalic acid, which is found in many plant-based foods, including spinach, rhubarb, most nuts and berries and chocolate, because it binds with metal ions. The process helps lead to the formation of kidney stones, which result when oxalate binds with calcium. Meanwhile, oxalic acid also forms in the body when people eat foods or supplements containing vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In test tube experiments the researchers found that oxalic acid caused minute amounts of gadolinium to precipitate out of the contrast agent and form nanoparticles, which then infiltrated the cells of various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some people might form these things, while others do not, and it may be their metabolic milieu," Wagner said. "It might be if they were in a high oxalic state or a state where molecules are more prone to linking to the gadolinium, leading to the formation of the nanoparticles. That might be why some individuals have such awful symptoms and this massive disease response, whereas other people are fine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding points to a possible way to mitigate some of the risks associated with MRI scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't take vitamin C if I needed to have an MRI with contrast because of the reactivity of the metal," Wagner said. "I'm hoping that we're getting closer to some recommendations for helping these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now researching ways to identify those who might be at greatest risk from gadolinium contrast agents. In a new study they're building an international patient registry that will include a collection of blood, urine, fingernail and hair samples, which could provide evidence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gadolinium/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gadolinium&lt;/a&gt; accumulation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to get a lot more information to come up with the risk factors that relate to those with symptoms," he said. "We're going to ask about what medical conditions you had at the time of exposure, what medications are you on, and we want to include &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+supplements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;, because that might piece it all together—why some people have symptoms, whereas others seem to be impervious."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's interconnected world, infectious diseases pose an escalating threat, as demonstrated by the coronavirus pandemic and outbreaks of H1N1, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and H5N1 (bird flu) viruses—all of which have had significant global health and economic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;But more common viral diseases also contribute to global health challenges and economic costs. For example, seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually, causing a substantial global disease burden and economic losses exceeding $11.2 billion each year in the United States alone. Meanwhile, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), spread primarily through oral contact, infects over two-thirds of the global population and is the leading cause of infectious blindness in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low vaccination rates for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza+viruses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;influenza viruses&lt;/a&gt; and the lack of an HSV vaccine underscore the need for a new approach—one that targets reducing viral loads at the sites where transmission occurs. And for viruses like these, which are transmitted more efficiently through the mouth than the nose, this means focusing on the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and collaborators in Finland, have done just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-gum-sars-cov-transmission.html"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt;—now in &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/news-events/2022/09/08/chewing-gum-designed-to-trap-sars-cov-2-in-the-saliva-moves-to-clinical-trial-from-dr-henry-daniells-lab/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;—showing that a similar approach was able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient saliva or swab samples by more than 95%, Henry Daniell, W.D. Miller Professor in Penn's School of Dental Medicine, and collaborators tested the ability of a chewing gum made from lablab beans, &lt;i&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/i&gt;—that naturally contain an antiviral trap protein (FRIL)—to neutralize two herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2). The chewing gum formulation allowed for effective and consistent release of FRIL at sites of viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They demonstrated that 40 milligrams of a two-gram bean gum tablet was adequate to reduce viral loads by more than 95%, a reduction similar to what they saw in their SARS-CoV-2 study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers prepared the gum as a clinical-grade drug product to comply with the FDA specifications for drug products and found the gum to be safe. Daniell notes, "These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniell and his colleagues are now looking to use lablab bean powder to tackle bird flu, which is currently having a significant impact in North America. In the previous three months, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;54 million birds&lt;/a&gt; have been affected by H5N1, and several human infections have been reported in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720310019?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;bean powder was shown&lt;/a&gt; by others to effectively neutralize H5N1 and H7N9—two strains of influenza A known to cause bird flu in humans as well as in birds. Daniell and colleagues are currently looking to test its use in bird feed to help control &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bird+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be major global challenge. A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission," says Daniell.&lt;/p&gt;

There's no consensus on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;definition of biological age&lt;/a&gt; or how to measure it, so it differs according to the test he refers to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin said he believes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worked-out-every-morning-for-a-week-challenge-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;exercising for an hour each day&lt;/a&gt; has made the biggest difference to his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I rarely take a day off. On that day off, I just miss it because I realize it optimizes everything else," he said. "If you're looking for an anti-aging drug that the Buck Institute is going to come up with in the next few years, it is probably going to be 10 years before we have anything that comes remotely close to exercise and physical activity," Verdin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He works out every day, doing a mixture of cardio, strength training, and mobility exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c49af111-1ef4-4cb3-b74c-4a69f1e84099" data-toc-id="c49af111-1ef4-4cb3-b74c-4a69f1e84099"&gt;Hot pilates four to five times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It hits all the notes that I need to hit," Verdin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves doing strength training exercises such as squats and pushups with small weights in the heat, which both challenge the muscles and make the heart and lungs work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that doing a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-lifting-and-cardio-may-help-you-live-longer-study-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;combination of weight lighting and cardio&lt;/a&gt; is best for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large 2022 study published in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2022/08/08/bjsports-2021-105315.info" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the National Cancer Institute examined data from nearly 100,000 older US adults. They found that participants who did resistance training once or twice a week as well as cardio, had a 41% lower risk of dying from chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease when compared to sedentary participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who did 150 to 300 minutes a week of aerobic exercise were, on average, 32% less likely to die from any cause during the course of the study. And resistance training was linked to 9% lower mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;

fezwLZ"&gt;"[The machine] is developed to issue medication after a teleconsultation," said Dr Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We know that 70% of people who call 111 are managed by phone, but actually, if you live somewhere like Dolgellau, where there is no pharmacy open overnight or on a Sunday, it's really hard to get access to medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's so exciting that academia can come together with the health service and industry to meet a real patient need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The machine stocks a variety of antibiotics, steroids and inhalers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Adam Mackridge, from Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said it was "quite simple" for patients to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"A clinician like myself working in 111 would speak to a patient and clinically assess them," said Dr Mackridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If they needed some medication, then I can log into the machine remotely, it generates a pin code which we read out to the patient and also text to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The patient then comes to the machine, puts that pin code in and it will issue the medication I've selected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dr Adam Mackridge says he thinks the

who live here or are holidaying in the area, historically would have to travel long distances to see a GP out-of-hours," said Dr Mackridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But over the past few years we've been able to offer more teleconsultations so we can support people closer to home, which has been brilliant in many respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But we've got that challenge about how we get medicine to those people, even though they've been clinically assessed remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"At the moment, prior to the machine coming here, patients would have to travel potentially as far as Bangor (50 miles away) to be able to access medicines when the pharmacies in the area were closed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dr Jonathan Butcher says the prospect of

dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Jonathan Butcher, who works as a local GP in Dolgellau, said the new machine meant people would no longer have to wait to collect their medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"That will help them feel better quicker," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Not everyone can travel or drive the long distances in the evenings or on weekends to find a pharmacy that's open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Butcher said the prospect of travelling a long way for a prescription meant some patients "did not seek healthcare when they needed it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is going to be a good opportunity, and if people realise that they can get the medication just round the corner in the town, that is going to be fantastic for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

think [the machine] is a brilliant idea," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Llinos Rowlands, who lives in Dolgellau, also liked the idea of the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

All the drinks were cherry flavoured, so the participants did not notice the difference, and each of them was exercising their own control over the consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of the drinks was random for the participants, with the gap between the sessions ranging from two days to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that artificial sweeteners are effective for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resulted in an increased blood flow to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps control the appetite and cravings. However, when the same participants drank a beverage containing sucrose, also known as table sugar, there was a hunger-decreasing effect. The peripheral glucose levels spiked, and this corresponded with reduced blood flow to the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hours after consuming sucrose, participants reported significantly lower hunger levels than when they consumed sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the research suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may not actually be useful for losing weight or reducing the cravings for sugar. Additionally, they seem to change how the hypothalamus communicates with the rest of the brain. A similar &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0031717" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; was carried out on male and obesity-prone female rats, and the results were similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sucrose but with zero calories. However, it creates a "mismatch between the expectation of caloric intake and the absence of actual energy," explained the authors of the study. "If your body is expecting a calorie because of the sweetness, but doesn't get the calorie it's expecting, that could change the way the brain is primed to crave those substances over time," warned Kathleen Alanna Page, a supervisor of the study and endocrinologist from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of American adults regularly consume these sugar substitutes, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31395-8/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, unaware of their ironical effects.

After finishing the drink, the researchers collected more data after 10 minutes, 35 minutes, and 120 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers concluded all sessions, they compared the MRI scans and the participants’ reports to determine how sucralose impacts brain signaling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, overall, sucralose not only increased blood flow in the hypothalamus compared to water, but to sucrose as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This indicates a stronger hunger-related brain response which could lead to stimulating the appetite rather than suppressing it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was the finding for the group as a whole, when breaking down responses among weight group and sex, the results vary a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at healthy weights showed a stronger increase in hypothalamic activity after sucralose consumption than after sucrose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the overweight category did not show significant differences in hypothalamic blood flow in response to any drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with obesity, hunger-related brain activity increased after drinking sucralose compared to water, but not compared to regular sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose use did not seem to significantly affect hunger responses in people with overweight, the results suggest that it may still significantly impact a large percentage of people overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When taking sex into consideration, females showed a stronger response to sucralose over sucrose and water. The researchers believe this supports the notion that women may have a stronger brain response to food cues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that their functional connectivity analysis showed that, compared to table sugar, sucralose “significantly increased coupling between the hypothalamus and the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312349" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;.” This is significant because this area of the brain impacts reward processing and could intensify food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at how participants rated their hunger levels, at the start of the experiment, people reported similar hunger levels across all drink sessions — their initial hunger was about the same no matter which drink they were about to consume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the type of drink the participants drank affected how they rated their hunger afterward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The participants felt hungrier after consuming sucralose versus sugar but did not report this effect compared to drinking water. The researchers believe that sucralose does not trigger hormones that tell the body it is full. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers note that this area needs more research, the findings suggest that the non-caloric sweetener sucralose may inadvertently affect the brain and trigger the hunger response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that many people use this sweetener to avoid calories and lose weight, this is important to keep in mind when making food and beverage choices since sucralose has the potential to cause hunger and increase food intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on this study, it seems that the brain processes non-caloric sweeteners to the same or greater extent than actual sugar,” said Ali. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali said the study findings may impact clinical recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We already recommend that our patients emphasize protein and non-starchy vegetables in the diet and minimize carbohydrates and sugars,” Ali noted. “After this study, I’m also inclined to recommend my patients minimize non-caloric sweeteners as well.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nourishednutritionandfitness.com/meet-eliza-whitaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;Eliza Whitaker&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, founder and registered dietitian at Nourished Nutrition and Fitness, also chimed in on the study for &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could suggest that the brain expects energy from calories when eating something sweet. However, this expectation is not met when consuming non-caloric sweeteners, like sucralose, which may prevent the processes within the hypothalamus that reduce appetite after eating something sweet from occurring the way they do when consuming calorie-containing sweeteners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitaker said the study findings would not impact clinical recommendations at this time, since more research is needed, but did say that it may need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It may be beneficial to assess sucralose intake for someone who has made other dietary adjustments and feels they are still unable to reach their health goals,” commented Whitaker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOX1JodGZUQ1hsaG0tXzg4cTg3YlBYcTZScHFWVE15WWY1ajRZQlBZTkY4VWZEYW9OQXJITkM5X2c2clZKd1dyR3F3YUlYQ3lXbjFlYm9yaEpENUVFLUlINnhBWGlfeGJwZGY2aVJRWFhhUWpxRnBqWXNldWhrQmpsb2tCeXotU2t2SU9TdG5PQnFRZS1telg1QjZXcnN5TV82TVMyV1RB</guid></item><item><title>NIH prepares to launch new research into autism causes, a Trump priority - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNSlU5aTF6MDhDX09FaDlzRHFBUUY1Uzc4dFB2MmNOcjQxdmNteENlcUFUQ2FvYy1yVXVIcGtRNlRCSl94V0dTUm95dFV5aEtTQ2FWX1N1RjE1b0VDc3Zpb2lOMzJETzlKcVd2WGVYWUZHZE90YTFrMUtGWWpTbHRtcXFmYXlrMERqeTFuRE5oSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5SDJDPAK5F3PGDF3CVQ3WHY4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Institutes of Health is planning a new, multimillion-dollar research program examining&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the causes of autism and the spike in U.S. diagnoses, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe in-progress discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7ITBVAK4VEOFAKMMEA5IDCG74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, Principal Deputy Director Matthew J.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TARRANT COUNTY, Texas — Tarrant County Public Health (TCPH) announced Friday that a person who visited two Grapevine locations between March 28 and 30 has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from TCPH, the person visited Great Wolf Lodge, located at 100 Great Wolf Drive, between early Friday, March 28 and Sunday, March 30. TCPH said the person also walked around Grapevine Mills Mall and ate at the food court on Saturday, March 29. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you were at either of these locations during the specified dates and are not vaccinated against measles or are unsure of your immunity, you may be at risk of contracting measles," TCPH said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH said that it is working with the Texas Department of Health Services Regional Office and others to monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 450 cases of measles have been reported in Texas, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/first-measles-case-reported-in-rockwall-county/287-f81ab0fd-e9dc-42fd-a25a-22f0e420a456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;including six here in North Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and a child in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;has died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 13, officials with the Paris-Lamar County Health District &lt;a href="/article/news/health/4-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-paris-lamar-county/287-f9b565ea-4146-43dd-95a8-638ffae2fb74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;confirmed five cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/article/news/health/first-measles-case-reported-in-rockwall-county/287-f81ab0fd-e9dc-42fd-a25a-22f0e420a456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Rockwall County reported one case &lt;/a&gt;in late February.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were exposed at the venues during the dates listed, TCPH recommends that you monitor yourself for measles symptoms through April 20. These symptoms include a fever above 101 degrees, cough, runny nose or conjunctivitis, followed by a red, blotchy rash that begins at the hairline and behind the ears, then goes further down the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH said if you experience any of these symptoms, stay home and call your healthcare provider for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Common symptoms of measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from Tarrant County Public Health, Great Wolf Lodge and the Texas Department of State Health Services update on Friday, April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 03:11:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1mMTV2LURWOFREc1dfNm5hOVZUY0pjWDhMR1E4NDNaLXRfZmdySy1VaUR5ZUcxQWdxODNRdU9udmNuWGw2S3cyNk9rUDYyckYxYndzOElFc0x6bWszVmFEVVVaZ9IBaEFVX3lxTE5YTDRMSjhna21MSFdEMHctS1lfbmlCVWNoRlcwMjJtc0VoZVBFellWNWE1ckc1ci1GTkI5aEdnWk1rT2FMbkEydW1iZHEtWHNIR0xhS2RuUFpEZi1qemozelZlRkVOUVNL</guid></item><item><title>Multivitamin to magnesium: 3 most common vitamin supplements that can land us in danger - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to stay healthy, and taking vitamin supplements might seem like a quick and easy way to fill the nutritional gaps. But here’s something surprising—not all supplements are as safe or helpful as they seem. In fact, some of the most common ones can silently mess with our gut health and leave us feeling worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gut is like the command center for our overall well-being. It’s not just about digestion—it also impacts our mood, immunity, and even our energy levels. But when certain synthetic supplements disrupt this delicate system, they can trigger problems you never expected. Here are 3 such vitamin supplements, as per Dr Janine Bowring, ND, a naturopathic doctor that we should watch out for and what you can do instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Synthetic multivitamins: A cocktail of trouble for our gut&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many over-the-counter multivitamins are synthetic. If you look at the ingredient list and see names like Vitamin A as Retinyl Palmitate or Vitamin B6 as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, that’s your red flag. These are lab-made versions, not the kind your body naturally gets from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which do you believe is better for gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These synthetic forms can irritate your gut lining, disturb the balance of good bacteria, and in some cases, even overload your liver over time. They’re harder for the body to break down, which means instead of absorbing nutrients, your body ends up struggling to detox them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What you can do instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go for whole food-based multivitamins. These are made from concentrated food sources and are much gentler on your digestive system. Even better, try to get most of your vitamins from real foods like leafy greens, fruits, seeds, and nuts. Nature does it best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12: A sneaky gut irritant&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is essential for energy and nerve health—but here’s the catch. If our supplement label says cyanocobalamin, it’s a synthetic version that contains a tiny amount of cyanide. While the dose is low, regular intake can affect detox pathways and may irritate our gut and liver, especially if our body is already under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop there. People with gut issues like IBS or low stomach acid may not even absorb this form of B12 properly, so it just adds to the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to choose instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always look for methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin—these are more natural, bioavailable forms of B12. Also, try to include more B12-rich foods like eggs, dairy, and fish in our diet. Fermented foods like curd can also help with gut health while improving B12 absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It sounds harmless, but it can be a silent disruptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305453403_Delay_effect_of_magnesium_stearate_on_tablet_dissolution_in_acidic_medium" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggest that magnesium stearate can create a biofilm in the gut, which prevents proper nutrient absorption. It may also reduce the effectiveness of probiotics and harm the gut’s protective barrier over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s a better choice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for supplements without fillers or additives like magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, or artificial colors. Brands that say “clean label” or “additive-free” are a safer bet. Again, choosing nutrients from whole foods is the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;The Importance of a Strong Digestive Fire for Holistic Health in Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to fall into the supplement trap, especially with the attractive labels and tall claims. But your gut health is too precious to risk. Just because something is labeled as a “vitamin” doesn’t mean it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always read the labels, question what's inside, and when in doubt, choose food over pills. If you’re unsure, speak to a qualified nutritionist or functional medicine expert to figure out what your body truly needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, less is more—and a clean, nutrient-rich diet can give you far better results than a shelf full of synthetic supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg</guid></item><item><title>5 nurses who work on the same floor at Massachusetts hospital have brain tumors - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPd1EyajhKRVNrQndzbWh3SjhwdGNqcUllSEFCLUdhS3BLUTV6alFhNTROcGRVUkpPOHRUMlNFNEg4cFJNMFFwdGdMcllrQ1lrS25uNVFJa0Q4OGFRalhaS3RJT2NKLUdUVjMyWk9DWUNuWVpMWS1MTXdtQzJTVFhmQTBVOUdjWXhrQjY0QjNrZzIyZzF3OW5HZ1BSaW9yTTlrZEYyNE9R0gFWQVVfeXFMTmthaWl1S3VlVENua2JKb2pqNl9lQ1FBbDd5d3NTSkpUNlkzcV9zcThsYnM4T2hHdzlZZV9nUjdTXzhBWF91T2FqaW1fWk9PbVpuR3dSUHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns. Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type — meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,” the hospital’s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources.
