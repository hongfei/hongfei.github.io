And the topic seems to be everywhere. Do you think the U.S. should continue &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:funding aid programs for diseases such as AIDS, TB and malaria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;funding aid programs for diseases such as AIDS, TB and malaria&lt;/a&gt;?

Do you seek out or steer clear of the annual flu vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As someone who recently completed 15 years of post-college training to become an infectious diseases physician-scientist, I can’t avoid these conversations. I just wish I knew the magic words to reach people willing to jettison decades of evidence and research for something they read online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I am proud of my work and committed to my profession. Yet in a country polarized by everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/politics/trump-kirk-free-speech-hate-speech-left.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:response to the abhorrent assassination of Charlie Kirk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;response to the abhorrent assassination of Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/health/rfk-jr-hhs-vaccine-committee-members.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:RFK Jr.’s abrupt reconfiguration of the nation’s vaccine advisory committee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;RFK Jr.’s abrupt reconfiguration of the nation’s vaccine advisory committee&lt;/a&gt;, I hesitated to share my occupation with the talkative young man I was recently seated next to on a flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the inevitable career question came up, he jumped right in. Despite the early hour and lack of sleep, with no viable exit option, I decided to face the challenge, though I braced for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lyme disease was first on the list. We were flying out of Connecticut, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You’ve never heard that Lyme disease was created as a bioterrorism weapon?” I had not (because &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/21681" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it wasn’t;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;it wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;). Somehow, in between the hours caring for patients, researching disease pathogenesis and staying up to date on the literature in my field, I had missed this infectious disease conspiracy du jour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s called Lyme because that’s where they released it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. Old Lyme, Connecticut, is where epidemiologists realized that patients’ symptoms coincided with recent tick bites and then confirmed that local ticks carried the disease-causing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You can’t cure it; it was made to weaponize.” Actually, we have very &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:effective antibiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;effective antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to kill the bacteria (though some people can develop a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs-symptoms/chronic-symptoms-and-lyme-disease.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complex post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;complex post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome&lt;/a&gt;). I’m not a military strategist, but I can’t imagine that indiscriminately infecting outdoor enthusiasts with a non-deadly, treatable disease that requires transmission via a slow-feeding arthropod would be an ideal bioterrorism plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But why is it spreading so fast now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Climate change, expanding tick habitats and food sources, and a lack of winters that kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He laughed. “So in your ‘profesh’ opinion, Lyme disease as a bioterrorism weapon is a bunch of horseshit?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes. That I do agree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We moved on to the next obvious infectious disease topic: COVID-19. I gave him space. He wasn’t sparring with a lack of respect, nor was I. We opened up about experiencing the pandemic in completely different ways. He described how hard it was being forced to get vaccinated, feeling coerced to keep his job but fearing the vaccine’s purported harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I shared my experience working in the hospital. I told him how I had witnessed numerous people die alone, and how the vaccine was a true savior. He believed it was only old people who had died. I told him I had seen enough young, healthy people become debilitated that I would never make that bet, not in that pandemic or the next one. In fact, by September 2023, &lt;a href="https://data.cdc.gov/National-Center-for-Health-Statistics/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku/data_preview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I tried to hear his concerns. I admitted that my passion for science and what I had experienced as a physician may have made me unfairly dismissive of people whose primary concerns were being stuck at home unable to pay rent or educate their children. I acknowledged that there’s always a small chance that some people might experience an adverse reaction to any medical intervention, be it a vaccine or over-the-counter drug, and I can understand why that makes some people hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I also reiterated the rigor of the scientific process involved in developing treatments, reviewing safety data, and ultimately making clinical recommendations. I told him that mRNA vaccines are neither new — &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/decades-making-mrna-covid-19-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:they’ve been in development for decades;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;they’ve been in development for decades&lt;/a&gt; — nor a government-led conspiracy to genetically manipulate the population. The reference to “genetic material” may lead to misconceptions, but mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus, where our DNA resides. Our cells do not even possess the molecular machinery capable of turning mRNA into DNA. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/how-they-work.html#:~:text=How%20mRNA%20COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fact&lt;/a&gt;, not just my “profesh” opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It felt real, the effort to hear and speak to each other. And I learned things from him, too. In response to my insistence that his infection-related conspiracy theories were nothing but that, he admitted, “Yeah, you’re probably right.” Then he added, with a smile on his face, “But conspiracies are a lot more fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracies are a lot more fun&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe vaccine or disease origin conspiracies are fun — if you’re young and healthy, if you’re bored, if you’re motivated to access a community that promises you “inside information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for the population as a whole, they are unbelievably dangerous. Conspiracy theories are why a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year&lt;/a&gt;, why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/us/gunman-cdc-shooting-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting&lt;/a&gt;.

The experience left me with genuine hope that we could maintain trust in each other and reminded me that scientists and physicians cannot give up on having these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With COVID, vaccines, Lyme disease, any of it — I’m not your enemy,” I told my seatmate as we were getting ready to disembark. “And I know you’re not the enemy, either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“True,” he agreed. “But they always want to make someone your enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. That is what conspiracy theories require. That is why we have to talk to each other. See me as a person. And I will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I am not your enemy. Neither is science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morgan Goheen, M.D., Ph.D., works at Yale School of Medicine as a research scientist and board-certified

I was nervous. I was constantly biting my lips and chewing my cheeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Maria developed severe anxiety and began having negative thoughts. "These pills were having a profound effect on my psyche," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Maria, who lives in St Petersburg, says she wasn't prepared for such severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Other TikTok users mentioned dilated pupils, tremors and insomnia.

But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling "unregistered dietary supplements" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as "sports nutrition" instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine.

Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;&lt;i id="details-of-support-with-eating-disorders-in-the-uk-are-available-at" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Details of support with eating disorders in the UK are available at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2DRkg4JC7SLT3B7hlrn6DKN/information-and-support-eating-disorders" class="sc-f9178328-0 kgTYQp"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;BBC Action Line&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders.

Also known as Xerostomia, this is an oral health condition that reduces saliva flow, leading to various symptoms including bad breath, rapid tooth decay and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How common is Dry Mouth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to dentists, the condition is more common than you think.

However, Dr Kourosh Maddahi, a dentist at Dion Health in California shared with NBC Select, that the condition is underdiagnosed as people often mistake it with dehydration. And the longer it remains undiagnosed the more damage it creates for your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Home remedies to get rid of bad breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 report by the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/xerostomia#:~:text=Severity%20of%20dry%20mouth%20symptoms,22%25%20of%20the%20global%20population." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; stated that dry mouth affects about 10 to 26 per cent of men and 10 to 33 per cent of women.

Most treatments for dry mouth consist of over-the-counter products such as mouthwashes, gels, chewing gums and lozenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes longer lifestyle changes such as avoiding certain food items and drinks are also required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding dry mouth or xerostomia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple words, dry mouth is a condition that makes the mouth feel dry due to an inadequate amount of saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent causes of the condition are the use of certain medications. As per a 2018 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29071719/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, urologic medications, antidepressants and psycholeptics were associated with dry mouth in adults. Additionally, chemotherapy or head and neck cancer radiotherapy can also cause the condition as they directly cause toxicity to salivary glands and oral tissues. And, tobacco and cannabis use can also accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry mouth can be damaging to oral health because of the changes it causes to the amount and consistency of saliva in the mouth. Saliva is a natural antibiotic in the mouth and protects it from bacteria, acts as a lubricant, and cleans plaque and other particles from teeth. It also remineralises tooth enamel as it is packed with calcium and phosphate, making the teeth resistant to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a lack of saliva in the mouth, all the symptoms of dry mouth can amp up the progression of the condition and lead to more damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger adults are developing a severe gut disorder at increasing rates, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis among Americans younger than 50, researchers from UCLA and Vanderbilt University recently reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the proportion of patients younger than 50 admitted to the hospital with severe diverticulitis increased by more than half, rising from just under 19% in 2005 to more than 28% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a significant shift in who is being hospitalized for severe diverticulitis," said lead researcher Shineui Kim, a fourth-year medical student at the &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/David_Geffen/" target="_blank" title="David Geffen" class="tpstyle"&gt;David Geffen&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine at UCLA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This condition was traditionally thought of as a disease of older adults, but our data shows that younger Americans are increasingly affected, and often with more complicated presentations," Kim said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverticulitis involves small pouches that form at weak spots along the wall of the colon. In severe cases, these pouches can become infected or torn, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers analyzed records of more than 5.2 million hospitalizations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these patients, about 16% were "early-onset" cases occurring in people younger than 50. The number of these cases that involved severe diverticulitis rose by 52% during the study period.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, treatment strategies also have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of younger patients requiring surgical removal of part of the colon to treat their diverticulitis dropped from nearly 35% to around 20%, showing that doctors are successfully using more conservative approaches to treat serious cases, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that younger diverticulitis patients tended to die less often and have shorter hospital stays and lower hospitalization costs compared to older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they also were more likely to require complicated procedures, with 29% higher odds of needing to remove part of the colon and 58% higher odds of requiring abscess drainage, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions," Kim said. "This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear why more younger adults are developing diverticulitis, but researchers noted the trend dovetails with an increased risk of colon cancer among this age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Little is known about why we're seeing this increase in younger patients," Kim said. "We urgently need additional research to determine what's driving these trends whether it's dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can lower their risk of diverticulitis by increasing the amount of fiber in their diet. Only surgery can remove pouches that have already developed in the colon, according to Harvard Medical School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study appears in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"The most common symptoms are fatigue and fever," says &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/michael-richardson/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Michael Richardson, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Michael Richardson, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He reports that other top COVID-19 symptoms in November 2025 include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shortness of breath (in severe cases)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scratchy &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-common-covid-19-symptoms-102500122.html" data-ylk='slk:"razorblade" throats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;' class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;"razorblade" throats&lt;/a&gt; were common during the summer of 2025. Some physicians &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-common-covid-19-symptoms-102500122.html" data-ylk="slk:are noticing less;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;are noticing less&lt;/a&gt; of this symptom, but others say it's alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We are hearing specifically about severe knifelike sore throat with far less cough as the primary symptom," says Dr. Nachman, who practices on Long Island in New York. "That is not to say that we don’t also expect fever, body aches and cough to occur, but rather we are seeing more throat complaints than in prior seasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thankfully, some other dangerous symptoms and side effects of COVID-19 aren't as prevalent in the fall of 2025. "While we are still seeing some COVID pneumonia, it is much less common than in prior years," says &lt;a href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Linda Yancey, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Linda Yancey, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist with Memorial Hermann Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also, doctors continue to see far less of two other symptoms once considered COVID-19 hallmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Early strains of COVID used to make people lose their sense of taste or smell, but that symptom is significantly less common today," says &lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-michael-dosik/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Michael Dosik, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Michael Dosik, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care physician with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:labfinder.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;labfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;experience a loss of taste and smell, it's a telltale sign you probably have COVID-19. However, there's only one way to tell for sure whether you have COVID-19, the flu or RSV (or none of the above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The best way to distinguish between them is by testing," Dr. Richardson clarifies. "All of them share similar symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, as COVID-19 has evolved, so have we. "Tests come back within minutes, helping to guide treatment plans and to discuss with families the possibility of [preventative strategies] for the household members," Dr. Nachman shares. "This is especially true for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-warn-look-flu-symptoms-145000937.html" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, where we have several easily available medications that people in close contact with flu can take to successfully prevent their own illness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/covid-had-startling-impact-brains-212500799.html" data-ylk="slk:COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Do We Really Need Another COVID Booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a common question, especially amid new federal guidelines—and at times, conflicting state policies. However, doctors remain firm that getting a COVID-19 booster is safe, effective and an excellent defense against severe illness from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"All adults would benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doctors-begging-patients-65-extra-202500816.html" data-ylk="slk:COVID booster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;COVID booster&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Richardson says. "Like the flu shot, the COVID booster changes and is targeted to the current strain of the illness. Getting the booster will protect you from serious side effects if you do encounter COVID."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He urges people to speak with their family physician if they have questions about the COVID-19 booster. Dr. Nachman also suggests having a close discussion with your medical provider, who knows your medical history, including your age and underlying conditions (like diabetes and lung disease), you have that might put you at a greater risk for severe illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In general, it's important to recognize that these vaccines will help prevent hospitalization and emergency room visits, but not every trace of illnesses," Dr. Nachman says. "So, yes, it will be important to get these vaccines."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When should you get your COVID-19 booster? If you're reading this in November 2025, there's no time like the present!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Now is a good time to get a COVID booster," Dr. Yancey urges. "Though most cases are mild, you can spare yourself a week of fever and cough, and you will be protecting your at-risk friends and family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/immune-system/articles/immunologists-people-over-50-adopt-182500882.html" data-ylk="slk:Immunologists Are Begging People Over 50 To Start Doing This 1 Daily Habit ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Immunologists Are Begging People Over 50 To Start Doing This 1 Daily Habit ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What's the Best Way To Treat COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, make sure you actually have COVID-19. "It’s important to be cautious and get an at-home COVID test to see if you have an active infection and need to isolate," Dr. Richardson explains. "Then, depending on the results, you should isolate or wear a mask. If the test is negative, you should check again the next day if you are still having symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you're positive, tell hustle culture to take a seat. "The best thing to do when you have COVID or any viral illness is rest and stay hydrated," Dr. Dosik explains. "Your body is fighting a battle internally, and so you shouldn’t do anything to stress it externally. Using acetaminophen or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can be useful to reduce high fevers and for pain relief to get you through the worst of the illness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;FWIW, your colleagues and boss should thank you for calling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If ill, please try to stay home from work," Dr. Nachman advises. "It does not matter if you have RSV, the flu or COVID. You are highly contagious and likely to pass these viral illnesses to your co-workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-warn-look-flu-symptoms-145000937.html" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Protects You From COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The basics still apply. "No surprises here: The best way to not get sick is to vaccinate, don’t share straws or drink from others' cups, try to stay a few feet away from someone who is coughing and wash your hands," Dr. Nachman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She reiterates that the vaccine can help prevent ER visits and hospitalizations. Cringe all you want at the idea of social distancing—it remains a best practice if someone near you seems sick. Respiratory viruses can spread through the air. The precise distance these germs can travel depends on the illness, but you likely don't know what the person near you in the grocery store has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Some pathogens on things like door knobs or can easily pass when sharing drinks, so common sense always helps," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Yancey notes that wearing a mask in crowded public spaces can also reduce viral spread. Ideally, you aren't standing next to someone who is sick and contagious at the grocery store because they stayed home—and you're doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If you aren’t feeling well, stay home," Dr. Richardson urges. "This will help you feel better faster and will also help by not spreading the illness to others...Before going back into the world, make sure you have been fever-free for the last 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for all of those &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-live-100-one-vitamin-112500554.html" data-ylk="slk:vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and supplements that promise to boost immunity? One-click buy with caution. "There is no conclusive data on the use of vitamins, over-the-counter supplements or anything that comes to us with just a personal recommendation," Dr. Nachman reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/daily-habit-might-quietly-reducing-145000084.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: The Surprising Daily Habit That Can Make Your Vaccine Less Effective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: The Surprising Daily Habit That Can Make Your Vaccine Less Effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptoms-november-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Nov 1, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

'No kid should have to go through that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper (left) and Luna Keown were both diagnosed with the rare genetic disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which leads to an insatiable appetite and uncontrolled weight gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unable to explain the weight gain despite diet and exercise, the clinic suggested Harper undergo genetic testing last year, which revealed she had Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare condition affecting just under 5,000 Americans that causes weight gain and constant, insatiable hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition usually manifests early in childhood and progresses over time and affects nearly every major organ, eventually leading to vision loss, kidney failure and developmental delays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed Harper's younger sister, Luna, also had BBS, though she hadn't yet displayed symptoms, and both of their parents were carriers for the mutated genes that cause the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: '[The doctor] was just mind-blown. She was like, "I've never heard of this before."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BBS is caused by mutations in one of at least 24 different genes, most commonly BBS1 and BBS10, which provide instructions for the formation of cilia, hairlike structures on cells that help them relay sensory information like light, sound, smell and taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations cause a dysfunction of the brain's melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, which controls hunger and satiety. If the receptor is mutated, it cannot communicate to the brain that the body is full, leading to uncontrolled eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Harper, most patients start gaining excess weight around three to five years old, which continues into adulthood, often despite dietary changes and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna also started to gain weight around age four, jumping from 30 to 80 pounds within a few months, more than double the weight of the average preschooler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After their diagnosis, the girls were put on topiramate (known as Topamax), an anticonvulsant used off-label for weight loss, and Vyvanse, a stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder, to help slow their ravenous hunger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also take setmelanotide, a daily injection under the brand name Imcivree that targets the dysfunctional MC4R pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a complete gamechanger,' Keown told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper, pictured here, weighed 108 pounds by the time she was seven years old, and she endured bullying so bad that her family was forced to pull her out of school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Luna (left) and Harper are pictured earlier this year with their mother Ciara (right) after losing weight with medication and lifestyle changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the help of the medications, as well as dietary swaps and exercise, Harper has lost 30 pounds so far and Luna has lost 10 in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since losing the weight, Harper has regained the confidence to return to school, where she most enjoys spending time with her friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'She's braver now, like she'll stand up for herself now, whereas in kindergarten, she wouldn't stand up for herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's not had any problems. She absolutely loves [school].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the girls have lost weight, BBS still affects multiple major organ systems, leaving them with a team of about 10 specialists between the two of them. Luna is in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, while BBS has attacked Harper's liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, kidney disease can lead to growth issues, cognitive problems, anemia and incontinence. If it progresses, a kidney transplant may be necessary. And children who suffer from liver diseases may experience fatigue, nausea, a swollen abdomen, jaundice and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of children in liver failure will eventually need a transplant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in and out of doctor's [offices],' Keown said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls both have accommodations at school for their condition, including extra time during tests due to dyslexia, which BBS raises the risk of, additional restroom breaks due to kidney issues and rest time from gym class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Keown family is now working to spread awareness of BBS and connect with other families across the US.

'No kid should have to go through that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper (left) and Luna Keown were both diagnosed with the rare genetic disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which leads to an insatiable appetite and uncontrolled weight gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unable to explain the weight gain despite diet and exercise, the clinic suggested Harper undergo genetic testing last year, which revealed she had Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare condition affecting just under 5,000 Americans that causes weight gain and constant, insatiable hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition usually manifests early in childhood and progresses over time and affects nearly every major organ, eventually leading to vision loss, kidney failure and developmental delays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed Harper's younger sister, Luna, also had BBS, though she hadn't yet displayed symptoms, and both of their parents were carriers for the mutated genes that cause the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: '[The doctor] was just mind-blown. She was like, "I've never heard of this before."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BBS is caused by mutations in one of at least 24 different genes, most commonly BBS1 and BBS10, which provide instructions for the formation of cilia, hairlike structures on cells that help them relay sensory information like light, sound, smell and taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations cause a dysfunction of the brain's melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, which controls hunger and satiety. If the receptor is mutated, it cannot communicate to the brain that the body is full, leading to uncontrolled eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Harper, most patients start gaining excess weight around three to five years old, which continues into adulthood, often despite dietary changes and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna also started to gain weight around age four, jumping from 30 to 80 pounds within a few months, more than double the weight of the average preschooler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After their diagnosis, the girls were put on topiramate (known as Topamax), an anticonvulsant used off-label for weight loss, and Vyvanse, a stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder, to help slow their ravenous hunger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also take setmelanotide, a daily injection under the brand name Imcivree that targets the dysfunctional MC4R pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a complete gamechanger,' Keown told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper, pictured here, weighed 108 pounds by the time she was seven years old, and she endured bullying so bad that her family was forced to pull her out of school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Luna (left) and Harper are pictured earlier this year with their mother Ciara (right) after losing weight with medication and lifestyle changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the help of the medications, as well as dietary swaps and exercise, Harper has lost 30 pounds so far and Luna has lost 10 in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since losing the weight, Harper has regained the confidence to return to school, where she most enjoys spending time with her friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'She's braver now, like she'll stand up for herself now, whereas in kindergarten, she wouldn't stand up for herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's not had any problems. She absolutely loves [school].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the girls have lost weight, BBS still affects multiple major organ systems, leaving them with a team of about 10 specialists between the two of them. Luna is in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, while BBS has attacked Harper's liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, kidney disease can lead to growth issues, cognitive problems, anemia and incontinence. If it progresses, a kidney transplant may be necessary. And children who suffer from liver diseases may experience fatigue, nausea, a swollen abdomen, jaundice and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of children in liver failure will eventually need a transplant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in and out of doctor's [offices],' Keown said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls both have accommodations at school for their condition, including extra time during tests due to dyslexia, which BBS raises the risk of, additional restroom breaks due to kidney issues and rest time from gym class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Keown family is now working to spread awareness of BBS and connect with other families across the US.

Global research has consistently shown that certain foods contain powerful nutrients that can protect against chronic diseases and support longevity. Among these, whole grains, nuts, and fresh fruits and vegetables have received the strongest scientific backing. They not only provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants but also help regulate cholesterol, blood pressure, and inflammation, all key factors linked to ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, multiple large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants have confirmed that regular consumption of these foods is strongly associated with a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature death. Here’s a detailed look at how each of these three food groups supports long-term health and what science says about their impact on longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top 7 foods to boost immunity by nutritionist Kavita Devgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 everyday foods that can help you live longer, according to science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Whole Grains: The foundation of a healthy heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they are&lt;/strong&gt;: Whole grains include foods like oats, brown rice, barley, millets, quinoa, and whole wheat. Unlike refined grains, they retain all parts of the grain, the bran, germ, and endosperm, which makes them richer in nutrients and fibre.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific findings&lt;/strong&gt;: Meta-analyses of cohort studies involving over a million people have shown that individuals who regularly consume whole grains have a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality. A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2716" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt;2016 review published in BMJ &lt;/a&gt;and later systematic analyses confirmed that consuming about 90 grams of whole grains per day could reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Whole grains are packed with dietary fibre, B vitamins, magnesium, and plant compounds that promote healthy digestion and metabolism. The fibre content helps control cholesterol and blood sugar levels, while antioxidants reduce inflammation in the arteries. Together, these mechanisms improve heart function and support long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: Replacing refined carbohydrates like white rice or white bread with brown rice, oats, or whole-wheat chapatis is a simple way to increase whole-grain intake. Even small, consistent changes over time can have a measurable effect on overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Regular nut consumption has also been linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and inflammation-related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Nuts are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that help reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) while maintaining HDL (good cholesterol). They also contain magnesium, selenium, and antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress, one of the key factors in ageing and heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: A handful of unsalted nuts as a snack or as a topping on salads, yoghurt, or breakfast cereals provides an easy daily boost. Studies show that even moderate intake a few times per week contributes to cardiovascular protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

An optimal mix of two fruits and three vegetables per day has been associated with the strongest protective effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Fruits and vegetables contain compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols that protect cells from oxidative damage. Their potassium and fibre content also support heart health by regulating blood pressure and improving digestion. Additionally, these foods help maintain a healthy weight by providing nutrients with minimal calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to include them&lt;/strong&gt;: Aim for at least five servings daily, preferably of different colours leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, berries, citrus, and seasonal produce. Fresh and lightly cooked options retain the most nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why these foods matter for longevity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus suggests that no single food guarantees a longer life. However, consistent dietary patterns that prioritise plant-based, minimally processed foods, such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets, have shown measurable benefits in lowering the risk of premature death. Whole grains, nuts, and fruits and vegetables are common elements across these diets.

This causes swelling, reduces oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, and leads to breathlessness over time. It also affects blood vessels, contributing to heart attacks, strokes, and other systemic health problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even non-smokers aren’t safe. “Living in highly polluted areas can be equivalent to smoking 20–30 cigarettes a day,” Dr Chabbra warns. “Airborne toxins accelerate lung ageing, increase the risk of COPD, and may lead to lung cancer over time.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/g4986ec0bb32ef2c63c78da65caf7da186f0d0c094534ee07019fe42a82bc0f1fd3219e7c39ab040197bb748a29daedb051e31078c15e30b95ccda54611ba26d6_1280_1762009608515.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)" title="Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Chabbra emphasises the importance of reducing exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution for lung health.(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common causes of lung damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chabbra highlights key contributors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains thousands of harmful chemicals, causing DNA damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pollution: &lt;/strong&gt;Vehicle emissions, industrial smoke, and cooking fuels emit particles that penetrate lung tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Asbestos, silica, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase risk in industrial workers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing exposure to these major causes is essential for lung health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tips to help recover lung health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some damage may be permanent, Dr Chabbra explains that certain lifestyle changes can help restore lung function and prevent further damage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Quit smoking immediately – the first and most crucial step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Exercise regularly – brisk walking or light aerobic activity helps clear mucus and boost lung capacity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Improve indoor air quality – use HEPA air purifiers, proper ventilation, and avoid exposure during peak pollution hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Eat a nutritious, antioxidant-rich diet – fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, beetroot, garlic, and green tea help tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. Stay hydrated – adequate water intake helps thin mucus and flush toxins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Practice breathing exercises or yoga – techniques like Pranayama strengthen &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/noida-pulmonologist-shares-simple-tips-to-protect-your-eyes-and-lungs-from-post-diwali-air-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-101761381316121.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lungs"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt; and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/Screenshot_2025-11-01_204906_1762010366267.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Chabbra emphasises that vaccinations and regular health checks are vital for lung health.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. Vaccination – flu and pneumonia shots protect against infections that could further harm the lungs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. Regular health check-ups – especially for those over 40 or with a smoking history. Low-dose CT scans can detect early-stage lung cancer or other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In severe cases, a lung transplant may be the only option,” notes Dr Chabbra. “But early detection and proper care can significantly improve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preventing further damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution and smoking cause persistent damage,” Dr Chabbra emphasises. “The only way to protect your lungs is to quit smoking and minimise exposure to harmful pollutants.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds practical tips for everyday protection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a properly fitted N95 mask in high-pollution areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors and keep windows and doors closed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid biomass fuels like wood, coal, cow dung, or kerosene in poorly ventilated spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of diet, exercise and hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating antioxidant-rich foods, practising yoga, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated all support &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/pulmonologist-shares-5-tips-to-boost-lung-health-practice-deep-breathing-stay-physically-active-101757568840127.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lung health"&gt;lung health&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr Chabbra. “Hydration keeps mucus thin, making it easier to expel toxins and improving overall respiratory efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these steps consistently, lung health can improve, breathlessness can be reduced, and the risk of further complications can be minimised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

                A single oral administration of astringent FLs stimulated the central nervous system, activating the hypothalamic coricotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. The secreted CRH activated the noradrenaline (NA) neural network in the locus coeruleus (LC). The projection of NA from LC to the hypothalamus preoptic area suppresses sleep and promotes wakefulness. The projection of NA and dopamine (DA) from LC and DA from the ventral tegmental area to the hippocampus enhances memory. The projection of NA from LC to the brainstem activates sympathetic nerve activity, augmenting circulation and metabolism.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astringency is a dry, puckering, rough, or sandpapery sensation in the mouth caused by plant-derived polyphenols. Polyphenols, including flavanols, are well known for risk reduction in cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Flavanols, found abundantly in cocoa, red wine, and berries, are associated with improved memory and cognition, as well as protection against neuronal damage. Despite these benefits, flavanols have poor bioavailability—the fraction that actually enters the bloodstream after ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has left an important knowledge gap: how can flavanols influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; and the nervous system when so little of them is absorbed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, a research team led by Dr. Yasuyuki Fujii and Professor Naomi Osakabe from Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan, investigated how flavanols affect the nervous system through sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2025.101195" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Current Research in Food Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tested the hypothesis that the astringent taste of flavanols may act as a direct signal to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Flavanols exhibit an astringent taste. We hypothesized that this taste serves as a stimulus, transmitting signals directly to the central nervous system (comprising the brain and spinal cord). As a result, it is thought that flavanol stimulation is transmitted via &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+nerves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory nerves&lt;/a&gt; to activate the brain, subsequently inducing physiological responses in the periphery through the sympathetic nervous system," explains Dr. Fujii.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted experiments in 10-week-old mice, administering flavanols orally at doses of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg body weight, while control mice received only distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral tests showed that flavanol-fed mice exhibited greater motor activity, exploratory behavior, and improved learning and memory compared to controls. Flavanols enhanced neurotransmitter activity across several brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and its precursor levodopa, norepinephrine and its metabolite normetanephrine were elevated in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline network immediately after the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chemicals regulate motivation, attention, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;, and arousal. Furthermore, enzymes critical for noradrenaline synthesis (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tyrosine+hydroxylase/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tyrosine hydroxylase&lt;/a&gt; and dopamine-β-hydroxylase) and transport (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) were upregulated, strengthening the signaling capacity of the noradrenergic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, biochemical analysis revealed higher urinary levels of catecholamines—hormones released during stress—as well as increased activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a brain region central to stress regulation. Flavanol administration also boosted the expression of c-Fos (a key transcription factor) and corticotropin-releasing hormone in the PVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these results demonstrate that flavanol intake can trigger wide-ranging physiological responses resembling those induced by exercise—functioning as a moderate stressor that activates the central nervous system and enhances attention, arousal, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stress responses elicited by flavanols in this study are similar to those elicited by physical exercise. Thus, moderate intake of flavanols, despite their poor bioavailability, can improve the health and quality of life," said Dr. Fujii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have potential implications in the field of sensory nutrition. In particular, next-generation foods can be developed based on the sensory properties, physiological effects, and palatability of foods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapjmxg005x26qc7phk7fsz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe you know you snore like a bear, but you don’t feel much urgency to look into it. Or maybe you have been told to wear a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine for sleep apnea, but it is just so cumbersome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt00083b6nfv8989o6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that it is important to take obstructive sleep apnea seriously now –– it could impact your risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt00093b6ny2jfgi3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with a greater risk for new microbleeds in the brain, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000a3b6n4i62pfag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cerebral microbleeds are a common finding in the aging brain,” said Dr. Jonathan Graff-Radford, professor of neurology at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000b3b6na3h7u7ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Microbleeds increase with age, and people who have them have a slightly higher risk of future strokes and faster cognitive decline, Graff-Radford said. “Anything that increases microbleeds is relevant to brain aging,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000c3b6n3cbd3k5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which a blockage of airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues disrupts breathing during sleep. The condition is different from central sleep apnea, in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000d3b6nq9cpmjuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20377636" target="_blank"&gt;few ways to treat&lt;/a&gt; obstructive sleep apnea, including relying on oral devices that keep the throat open during sleep, regularly using a CPAP or similar machine, and having&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surgeries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000e3b6n9bdsz7ou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a strong methodology and should stress the importance of screening for sleep apnea to clinicians and treatment to patients, said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000f3b6n36xvckwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Don’t ignore it. Do something about it,” he said. “It’s not just the immediate risk for down the road for bleeds, but also later down the road for Alzheimer’s disease as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000g3b6njp28zsba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not addressing obstructive sleep apnea is a double whammy, Tanzi said. Not getting enough good-quality sleep –– which can be hard to do when your breathing is impaired during the night –– has been associated with brain aging, but the microbleeds that could result may increase the risk for dementia down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000h3b6ni2l13ef0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, which was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840617?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=102825" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, is observational, which means that it can only establish that obstructive sleep apnea and microbleeds are associated, not that one definitively causes the other. Further studies will need to examine if treating sleep apnea can prevent microbleeds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000i3b6npivtsxwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When is it time to ask your doctor about obstructive sleep apnea?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000j3b6ngiq9tqhg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loud, frequent snoring is a good indicator, Tanzi said. If your partner notices pauses in your breathing while you sleep or gasping and choking, that’s another sign you should look into sleep apnea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000k3b6nfkdupeza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Problems during the day can be a good indicator, too. Sleepiness, trouble concentrating, irritability and increased hunger are signs you may not be getting quality sleep and that it may be time to get assessed for sleep apnea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000l3b6na9i1gjvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Night sweats might also be a sign of sleep apnea, as research has shown that &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002795" target="_blank"&gt;about 30% of people&lt;/a&gt; with obstructive sleep apnea have reported night sweats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000m3b6nffaen3kt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14510-nocturia" target="_blank"&gt;Waking up at least two times&lt;/a&gt; in the night, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/health/weird-sleep-apnea-signs-wellness"&gt;teeth grinding&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1105630" target="_blank"&gt;morning headaches&lt;/a&gt; might also indicate a problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000n3b6nph3c83wy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest study “urges (people) to take it more seriously, because the damage that can come from obstructive sleep apnea can definitely be more severe than you think,” Tanzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

All three of the patients – two in Los Angeles and one in Long Beach – were hospitalized and are now recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;None of the patients had apparent links to each other and none had traveled internationally recently, indicating the virus is likely spreading undetected in some communities. There have been six cases of the new mpox variant found among travelers in the US, but this is the first sign of community spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The news comes as several European countries – Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal – also report apparent community transmission of the newer variant, and the older variant continues to circulate globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There have been more than 44,000 cases of mpox reported so far in 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report--59---30-october-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the World Health Organization. That’s more than the total reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The three cases in California appear may be linked genomically and may trace back to a travel case from August, &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-10-29-cdc-says-3-cases-severe-mpox-california-may-be-linked-august-case" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the American Hospital Association. The industry group said this information was released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an advisory on Wednesday, although that advisory does not appear to be available publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s media inquiry about potential genomic links between the cases and whether the virus appeared to be spreading in specific networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Given that the three cases in Los Angeles were all hospitalized, that lends a little bit more credence to the idea that maybe there is local transmission going on,” said Miguel Paredes, a genomic epidemiologist at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Los Angeles, about one in 33 cases of the older mpox variant is currently being detected, according to an October &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.09.25333368v2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored by Paredes, which has not been peer-reviewed or published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re thinking about a 3% case fatality rate, and we’re capturing the ones that are ‘more severe’, then we’re not really capturing the ones that are potentially less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination may also complicate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Vaccines are doing a good job of sometimes preventing infection but also creating less severe disease, which is good on an individual’s side. But it also makes passive surveillance a little difficult, because if you have less severe disease, you’re less likely to seek treatment or actually think you have mpox,” Paredes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That means researchers and officials need to be more proactive about finding and monitoring cases, not just recording the cases of people who seek care, he said. Wastewater sampling would be one relatively inexpensive and unobtrusive way to monitor spread, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2022, cases of the clade IIb mpox variant exploded internationally, infecting nearly 100,000 people around the world. About a third of the detected cases were in the US. The vast majority of those cases were among men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the new variant, which appears to have emerged in mid-2023 and was first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has not shown the same pattern. It has infected men and women, usually between the ages of 25 and 40, at roughly the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The outbreak in central and eastern Africa has spread through what Jason Kindrachuk calls “dense sexual networks”, or people with multiple sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a big piece of it,” said Kindrachuk, who is an international expert on mpox and vice president of the National Microbiology Laboratory branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dense sexual networks increased risk transmission generally. Regardless if you’re male or female, you had an increased probability or increased risk of getting infected if you were within those networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s difficult to know if the same pattern would continue in other countries, he said. “Trying to make assessments of what is going to happen in other regions of the world when you are looking at DRC or central Africa in general is very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There have only been a few community cases of the new variant detected internationally, so it’s not possible yet to make broad statements about the kinds of networks where it is spreading, Kindrachuk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;California has not released information about the gender or the sexuality of the patients. But the press release &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; the newer variant was “primarily impacting communities of gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, as well as their social networks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People are at higher risk for mpox if they are gay, bisexual, or a man who has sex with men, or are transgender or nonbinary, and have had more than one partner in the past six months, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20vaccination%20if:%20%0A%20%20,months%20have%20had%20any%20of%20the%20following:" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People are also at risk if they have recently visited a sex venue, such as a sex club or bathhouse, or recently had sex at large events in places where mpox is spreading, the CDC notes. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/monkeypox" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Mpox&lt;/a&gt; spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which makes sexual contact a major mode of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration has gutted international aid and development work, making it much more difficult to monitor and contain outbreaks like these. Officials in the US are focusing on vaccinating people who are at risk – some of whom may only have received the first of a two-part vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I always want to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Paredes said. “It’s like a small thing that can go a long way in protecting you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccines are more accessible when they are provided by the government rather than through private insurance, especially among low-resource communities, Paredes said. It also helps to offer shots outside of working hours and at easy-to-reach locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It may be more challenging to employ the same techniques that worked before to curb mpox. The US government is largely shut down, and the CDC has lost about a third of its staff this year due to layoffs and resignations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the public health networks used during the 2022 outbreak – STI and HIV monitoring, for example – have been on the chopping block under the second Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Communities affected by mpox may once again take the lead fighting against this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2022, organizations and members of the queer community worked together with officials to offer testing and vaccines, including at gatherings where people may be having intimate contact like sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Really, we benefited from community-based organizations providing information and going out and trying to reduce that stigma,” Kindrachuk said. He also voiced appreciation for members of the affected communities for “empowering individuals to feel comfortable with moving forward for testing and to be able to identify risks and potential infections as well”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1ySE5tWEgtSnhnWU1KYlNvR0dXeEhSNC02V1RUclMtcXlRMTNKc0xNb05VS0t1bkp3SGJuVl91TERfalU2VmNsSHJrRHdCdGQ5cEg1RFp5dWlsQUtPS0EzM2dpUVNpcVRneVZqcnhXV3ZRZFNNNGREbEhlR3phcEE</guid></item><item><title>你不知道的9种食物可以阻止头痛- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/9-foods-you-didnt-know-could-stop-headaches-in-their-tracks/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;When a headache or migraine arises, many reach into their medicine cabinets for an over-the-counter pain reliever such as Tylenol or Advil.

"The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions such as inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish also contain &lt;a target="_self" data-id="ed2bf375-1653-4bb8-946b-c0ebf6958045" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/looking-for-a-vitamin-d-boost-here-are-11-foods-to-add-to-your-diet/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins including riboflavin, which support healthy brain metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a data-id="0f110476-e830-4901-904e-d142c596a762" href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" target="_self"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions a &lt;a data-id="0f110476-e830-4901-904e-d142c596a762" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323014503#sec5" target="_self"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealing that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of migraines.

From the first year it was launched, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246200/gallup-national-health-index-work.aspx"&gt;Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index&lt;/a&gt; has found that the share of US adults reporting obesity has climbed and climbed, rising from 25.5 percent in 2008 to 39.9 percent in 2022. That survey caught the last leg of an epidemic that has been spreading for decades, with &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/obesity-rate-nearly-triples-united-states-over-last-50-years/"&gt;estimated obesity prevalence&lt;/a&gt; tripling over the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not that the country hasn’t tried to fight weight gain. But from the $33 billion Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;spend each year on weight loss products&lt;/a&gt; and services to government efforts like first lady Michelle Obama’s &lt;a href="https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"&gt;Let’s Move campaign&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/life/459495/kids-food-maha-diet-culture-virginia-sole-smith"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;, little has worked. Many doctors and patients came to believe the rise in obesity may be &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/25/717058877/the-biology-of-weight-loss#:~:text=That%27s%20because%20losing%20weight%20triggers,regain%20the%20weight%20you%20lost."&gt;all but biologically inescapable&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=Metabolic%20syndrome%20is%20closely%20linked%20to%20overweight,help%20you%20prevent%20and%20reduce%20metabolic%20syndrome."&gt;grave health risks&lt;/a&gt; that accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But maybe not. According to the latest results from Gallup’s survey, self-reported obesity has started to fall, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;declining by nearly 3 points&lt;/a&gt; to 37 percent in 2025. The self-reporting part is an important limitation — people’s reporting of their weight tends to be imprecise — and we’ll need more definitive proof from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be sure, but it’s some of the earliest evidence that the US may finally be turning a corner on one of the biggest health crises of the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the main reason it appears to be happening isn’t because weight-loss experts have stumbled upon a new diet that always works (we haven’t and probably never will) or because we’ve managed to ban all unhealthy junk food (we haven’t and almost certainly never will). It’s likely because of the growing use of &lt;a href="/the-gray-area/24158976/ozempic-drug-weight-loss-diabetes-risks"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;, better known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s changed is we now have highly effective weight-loss medicines working at a scale that we’ve never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/07/08/old-weight-loss-drugs-safety-effectiveness/#:~:text=Effective%2C%20but%20less%20so%20than,hunger%20so%20people%20eat%20less."&gt;Older weight-loss drugs&lt;/a&gt; tended to shave off only a few percentage points of body weight, and they came with tough trade-offs and quick weight rebound. The new drugs, which were originally developed to treat diabetes, are targeting the biology that makes weight so hard to lose and keep off: They &lt;a href="/science/24086968/glp-1-ozempic-semaglutide-craving-desire-science-wanting-liking-opioids-alcohol"&gt;dial down hunger in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, slow gastric emptying, and improve post-meal insulin signaling. In large randomized trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg — the active ingredient used in medicines like Ozempic — &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183?articleTools"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; about 15 percent average weight loss over 68 weeks when paired with basic lifestyle support. Other combinations &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038"&gt;have reached&lt;/a&gt; as much as 20 percent on higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those effect sizes are big enough that, when even a modest share of adults use them, you can start to see movement in the population data. And as further data from Gallup shows, more and more Americans are trying these drugs, with the survey finding that more than 12 percent of adults reported taking them in the second and third quarters of 2025, up from less than 6 percent in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And while much of the media coverage around these drugs has &lt;a href="/science-and-health/23584679/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-obesity"&gt;focused on weight and appearance&lt;/a&gt;, the health benefits seem to go much further. In 2024 the Food and Drug Administration added &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/215256s011lbl.pdf"&gt;cardiovascular risk as a reason to be prescribed&lt;/a&gt; the GLP-1 drug Wegovy, grounded in &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2023/11/09/15/04/select"&gt;results from a major trial&lt;/a&gt; that showed fewer heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths in adults with obesity or overweight and established heart disease. The FDA’s action also opened a door for &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/a-new-use-for-wegovy-opens-the-door-to-medicare-coverage-for-millions-of-people-with-obesity/"&gt;Medicare coverage in patients with cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; — an early sign that access for these expensive medicines could expand beyond the well-insured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-upside-of-downsizing-and-the-side-effects" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The upside of downsizing — and the side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s still early days, but if the national obesity curve keeps bending down, the benefits would be enormous. &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks"&gt;Obesity multiplies risk&lt;/a&gt; across nearly every major cause of death; even small, sustained declines in prevalence translate into millions fewer people living with diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, and painful joint disease — and billions saved in medical costs over time. The CDC pegs &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/php/about/index.html"&gt;direct medical spending&lt;/a&gt; tied to obesity at roughly $173 billion. Turning that curve even a little would represent significant relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But we’re a long way from solving this problem. For one thing, as effective as they are, these drugs behave more like statins than antibiotics: They work while you take them. When people stop, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUT8Zdb14zI"&gt;weight regain is common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And GLP-1s do come with side effects that for some patients have been serious enough to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779"&gt;lead to discontinuation&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists also still aren’t sure about some of the longer-term effects of the drugs, which &lt;a href="https://www.highbarhealth.com/blog/glp1-drugs-muscle-loss-guide#:~:text=Muscle%20Loss%20and%20Musculoskeletal%20Health,on%20adequate%20surrounding%20muscle%20mass."&gt;can include muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/glp-1-agonists/glp-1-side-effects"&gt;changes to sex drives&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/cost-of-weight-loss-drugs"&gt;four-figure monthly side effect&lt;/a&gt; on the wallet if GLP-1s need to be paid for out of pocket. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7484407/#:~:text=Socioeconomic%20status%20(SES)%20is%20an,by%20psychosocial%20stress%20%5B14%5D."&gt;Obesity is already linked to&lt;/a&gt; lower socioeconomic status, and that disparity could worsen if GLP-1s remain out of reach for all but high-income people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chances are, though, that the current generation of GLP-1s is the worst and most expensive we’ll ever have. Drug companies are already experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-025-00060-6"&gt;pill forms of the medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which would make dosing more precise and lower the barrier to access: as much as 20 percent of the American public has some form of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8020217/#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20Needle%20Phobia%20and,of%20population%20have%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=Hamilton%20found%20that%2010%25%20of%20the%20population%20suffered%20from%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=Taddio%20et%20al25%20and,population%20had%20a%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=These%20estimates%20suggest%20that%20between,studies%20on%20needle%20phobia%20exist.&amp;amp;text=Needle%20fear%20is%20an%20induced%20anxiety%20when%20needles%20or%20injections%20are%20used.&amp;amp;text=Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of,blood%2Dinjection%2Dinjury%20type.&amp;amp;text=Needle%20phobia%20is%20anxiety%20that,in%20the%20environment%20and%20event.&amp;amp;text=Estimating%20the%20number%20of%20patients,contact%20with%20the%20medical%20system."&gt;needle phobia&lt;/a&gt; (or trypanophobia, for those who want a great Scrabble word).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ll admit there’s something uncomfortable about the idea of solving obesity primarily through a drug. After all, as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze391y17z7o"&gt;fond of saying&lt;/a&gt;, can’t we fix obesity through healthier food and more exercise? But while our food system &lt;a href="/future-perfect/370257/ultra-processed-food-obesity-disease-depression-anxiety"&gt;could surely be improved&lt;/a&gt; and most of us &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/exercise.htm"&gt;don’t get enough exercise&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not as if we haven’t tried, whether as individuals or as a country. The simple fact is that the contemporary environment is one that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00049-0/fulltext"&gt;heavily weighted toward the obesogenic&lt;/a&gt;. GLP-1 drugs seem to offer the best chance to tilt the scales back in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQTUxZV2c3SG9vVGx1emNtVjNuRU1XS2sxR09HVlF1eE1udERfb2NkcEtnNGVBXzJraF91WXhuNTdvZmNFWFhyUXlSUnNQSk80dEtsenNkb1NHZFpVeEpFdkxrNG0taDA1WE01SnU3cXFTbWFGMVNtVC1YRlR4blFwbGxFenVmNVNP</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚打破了一个主要的运动神话- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251101000423.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Forget the old idea that physical activity drains your supply of heartbeats. New research from Australia shows that people who are physically fit actually use fewer heartbeats each day, which may help them live longer.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, athletes had an average heart rate of 68 beats per minute (bpm), while non-athletes averaged 76 bpm. Over a 24-hour period, this equals roughly 97,920 beats for athletes compared to 109,440 for non-athletes -- about 10 percent fewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's an incredible saving of about 11,500 beats a day," says Professor La Gerche, head of the HEART Laboratory supported by the St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research (SVI) and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (VCCRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds, "Even though athletes' hearts work harder during exercise, their lower resting rates more than make up for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Efficiency and Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;JACC: Advances&lt;/em&gt;, found that the most physically fit individuals had resting heart rates as low as 40 bpm, compared to the typical 70-80 bpm range. This means that, despite higher peaks during training, athletes still end up with fewer total beats across the day than those who are inactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fitter you are, the more metabolically efficient your body becomes," Professor La Gerche explains. "Even if you're training hard for an hour a day, your heart beats more slowly for the other 23 hours. The net effect is fewer beats used overall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slower resting heart rate is not only a sign of good physical condition but also a strong indicator of long-term health. Increasing physical activity, when done safely, can enhance heart performance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exercise is strongly linked with improved mental health, longer lifespan and lower rates of heart disease," Professor La Gerche says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate Exercise Delivers the Biggest Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although extreme endurance events such as the Tour de France can cause temporary increases in daily heartbeats, Professor La Gerche notes that the health benefits of consistent, moderate exercise far outweigh any risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The biggest bang for your health buck is going from unfit to moderately fit. Just a few hours of purposeful exercise each week can transform your heart's efficiency and help make every beat count. It may even extend your life by years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the HEART Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor La Gerche leads the Heart, Exercise &amp;amp; Research Trials (HEART) Lab, which investigates how exercise influences heart health, in partnership with SVI and VCCRI. By studying elite athletes, the team uncovers findings that reach well beyond sports performance, offering valuable insights for people living with serious heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Through her research, Bullman has found that eating fiber-rich foods like lentils and beans not only feeds &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gi-doctor-prevent-colon-cancer-eating-healthy-gut-microbiome-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;beneficial gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;. It may also reduce the risk of developing colon cancer and oral cancer, because dangerous gut bacteria can travel to the mouth (and vice versa). Plus, there is some evidence that high-fiber diets can improve responses to treatments for skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about your gut as a housing estate, you want the real estate to be occupied by these beneficial microbes," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenced by her own research, Bullman shared a few of the foods she eats to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prevent-colon-cancer-gi-doctor-research-gut-microbiome-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;reduce her cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5295abe4-6b16-4f08-a0d5-9d06dfdb80c3" data-toc-id="5295abe4-6b16-4f08-a0d5-9d06dfdb80c3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oatmeal with fruit is a filling, high-fiber breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When did you last find yourself with some spare time on your hands? A lack of free time, or 'temporal inequity', could be contributing to dementia risk, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new perspective article, researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia put forward the case for prioritizing time for our brain's sake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available time is required to keep on top of our health in many ways: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, purchasing fresh food to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;eat healthily&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;socializing regularly&lt;/a&gt;, for example, all compete with the daily demands of work, travel, and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these lifestyle factors are also thought to be linked to our chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-sign-deep-inside-your-eyes-could-warn-of-early-dementia"&gt;developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/loneliness-proteins-in-your-blood-could-be-putting-your-health-at-risk"&gt;how lonely we feel&lt;/a&gt;, how much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-food-may-exacerbate-cognitive-decline-new-studies-show"&gt;fast food we eat&lt;/a&gt;, the quality of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-in-reducing-dementia-risk"&gt;the sleep we get&lt;/a&gt;, the level of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;exercise we get&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bacteria-living-inside-your-mouth-may-shape-your-dementia-risk"&gt;our oral hygiene routines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-may-be-tied-to-vascular-dementia-cases-review-finds"&gt;Microplastics May Be Tied to Vascular Dementia Cases, Review Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up to 45 percent of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented if modifiable risk factors were eliminated," &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/news/2025/10/why-time-could-be-as-critical-as-diet-and-exercise-for-brain-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Susanne Röhr. "However, many people simply don't have the discretionary time to exercise, rest properly, eat healthily, or stay socially connected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This lack of time – what we call 'time poverty' – is a hidden barrier to dementia risk reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179035" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract-1.jpg" alt="Time chart" class="wp-image-179035 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract-1-600x380.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There are more demands on our time than ever. (Röhr et al., &lt;em&gt;Lancet Healthy Longev.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, steps to reduce our risk of dementia are often compromised by the pressures of work, caring for children and parents, and everything else modern life throws at us means we don't always have time to make the best choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some demographics have even less time than others, the researchers point out: it remains the case that women &lt;a href="https://www.caregiver.org/resource/women-and-caregiving-facts-and-figures/"&gt;handle the majority&lt;/a&gt; of caregiving tasks around the world, while those on lower incomes typically have to work hours &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230187"&gt;that are longer&lt;/a&gt; or less regular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, we need to spend around 10 hours a day on brain care to stay healthy. That means getting enough sleep, eating and drinking well, interacting with other people socially, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-calculated-how-much-exercise-we-need-to-offset-a-day-of-sitting"&gt;and exercising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many, especially those in disadvantaged or caregiving roles, this simply isn't achievable under current conditions," &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/news/2025/10/why-time-could-be-as-critical-as-diet-and-exercise-for-brain-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychology researcher Simone Reppermund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Addressing time poverty is therefore essential if we are serious about preventing dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solutions would require a complex mix of community support, including improvements to childcare, more flexible working arrangements (such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-4-day-work-week-experiment-begins-in-the-uk-the-largest-ever-conducted"&gt;four-day work weeks&lt;/a&gt;), improved public transport networks, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/australians-now-have-the-right-to-disconnect-but-how-workplaces-react-will-be-crucial-237023"&gt;the right to disconnect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a daunting challenge – but if steps aren't taken, the researchers argue, then dementia rates will &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-dementia-cases-to-double-by-2060-according-to-new-study"&gt;continue to rise&lt;/a&gt;. And as is often the case with public health, it's the most disadvantaged who will bear the greatest burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brain health policy and research have focused heavily on individual behavior change," &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/news/2025/10/why-time-could-be-as-critical-as-diet-and-exercise-for-brain-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropsychiatrist Perminder Sachdev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But unless people are given the temporal resources to act on these recommendations, we risk leaving behind those who need it most. Just as governments act on income inequality, we need to act on temporal inequity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100768"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a farmer in southern Italy noticed &lt;strong&gt;several large bones&lt;/strong&gt; jutting from the muddy bottom of a lake he used to irrigate his fields. It would take him three years of careful water management before scientists could examine what lay beneath. When they did, they uncovered the partial remains of a &lt;strong&gt;blue whale&lt;/strong&gt;—at nearly &lt;strong&gt;85 feet (26 m) long&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest fossil of the species ever found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The skeleton, excavated near the town of &lt;em&gt;Matera&lt;/em&gt;, is not just remarkable for its size. Radiometric dating suggests the animal lived more than &lt;strong&gt;1.5 million years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, far earlier than most existing models predicted the emergence of such large body sizes in &lt;strong&gt;baleen whales&lt;/strong&gt;. The find, detailed in a peer-reviewed study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, has added a significant piece to the puzzle of how Earth’s largest mammals came to be—and is quietly shifting long-held views about their evolutionary path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Fossil That Stretches the Evolutionary Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, researchers believed that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/new-whale-discovery-oceans-giants-evolved/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86593" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gigantism in baleen whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes species like the blue and fin whale, was a relatively recent development in evolutionary terms. A widely cited &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30435-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; proposed that baleen whales only reached massive sizes around &lt;strong&gt;300,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by changes in ocean productivity during the Pleistocene. The prevailing theory was that a surge in nutrients—due to oceanic upwelling and glacial cycles—created feeding grounds dense enough to support such enormous animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;Matera whale&lt;/em&gt;, as it’s now known, predates that window by more than a million years. According to lead paleontologist &lt;strong&gt;Giovanni Bianucci&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.unipi.it/index.php/scienze-naturali" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, the skeleton offers “tangible evidence” that large body size in whales may have evolved &lt;strong&gt;gradually&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than appearing suddenly in response to environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The fossil also fills a critical gap in the sparse fossil record of large marine mammals from before 2.5 million years ago, a period when ice age cycles and shifting sea levels often buried remains beneath deep sediment or submerged them beneath the ocean floor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Clues From an Ancient Skull&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of what makes the fossil valuable lies in its condition. The &lt;strong&gt;nearly intact skull&lt;/strong&gt;, recovered alongside &lt;strong&gt;vertebrae &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;rib bones&lt;/strong&gt;, provides scientists with a rare look at the anatomical structure of &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-solve-missing-blue-whale-calves/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75985" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early blue whales&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other large fossil whale finds, which often consist of partial or crushed bones, the &lt;em&gt;Matera specimen&lt;/em&gt; gives researchers a more complete picture of both size and morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skull, in particular, allows for precise comparisons to modern blue whales, which can grow up to 100 feet in length. While the fossilized whale is slightly shorter, it still ranks among the &lt;strong&gt;largest animals ever to live&lt;/strong&gt;, and its features suggest a direct lineage to modern species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Felix Marx, a co-author of the study and researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.naturalsciences.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, noted that when the &lt;em&gt;Matera whale&lt;/em&gt; was included in existing evolutionary datasets, models began to shift. “The most probable date for the onset of large body size moved back to somewhere between &lt;strong&gt;3.6 and 6 million years ago&lt;/strong&gt;,” Marx said in an interview. “That’s not a small adjustment—it changes how we understand whale evolution altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Challenging the “Sudden Shift” Model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The traditional model of whale evolution hinges on the idea that environmental forces—particularly during the late Pleistocene—triggered rapid size increases in baleen whales. These changes, it was argued, offered evolutionary advantages, such as long-distance migration and more efficient foraging in nutrient-rich zones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Italian discovery complicates that narrative. If whales of such magnitude already existed 1.5 million years ago, their evolution may not have been tied exclusively to glacial-era food distribution. Instead, size may have increased &lt;strong&gt;incrementally over millions of years&lt;/strong&gt;, possibly influenced by a combination of &lt;strong&gt;long-term ecological pressures&lt;/strong&gt;, including competition, predation, and shifting ocean temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions from a single fossil. &lt;em&gt;Graham Slater&lt;/em&gt;, an evolutionary biologist at the &lt;em&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/em&gt; who co-authored the 2017 study, said the new fossil still falls within the broader timeframe his team proposed. Still, he acknowledged that it lends weight to arguments favoring a more gradual shift. “It’s a data point we’ve been missing,” Slater told &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.fr/sciences/2019/05/ce-fossile-de-baleine-bleue-est-le-plus-grand-jamais-decouvert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the initial study. “We just don’t have many of these fossils from that period.”&lt;/p&gt;
