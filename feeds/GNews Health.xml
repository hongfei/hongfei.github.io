It’s a mixed answer, but the bright spot is scientific progress on vaccines. The Covid vaccines were produced faster than any previous effort, and are credited with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;saving millions of lives from 2021&lt;/a&gt; onwards. The mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – were designed within days of the Sars-CoV-2 genome being published in January 2020, and went into safety trials over the following months before finally being approved in the UK at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But could they have additional benefits? According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03432-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature, mRNA vaccines seem to trigger a powerful immune response that increases the median survival time by about 75% for certain cancer patients. These findings – which are being further developed – could indicate the power of repurposing vaccines and medicines that have already passed trials for safety and are available at reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How could Covid vaccines play a part in cancer treatment? Cancer develops when normal cells in the body grow and divide without control. Usually, cell division is strictly controlled, but when certain mutations happen – sometimes caused by tobacco, or radiation, inherited genetic factors or environmental exposure – the body is no longer able to stop uncontrolled cell growth. These cells (often referred to as malignant) build up to form a tumour – an abnormal growth. To keep growing, these cells create new blood vessels to feed themselves and start to spread around the body – called metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Our immune system is excellent at recognising invaders in our body – think of viruses or bacteria – but given that cancerous cells are part of our body, they prove hard for our immune system to distinguish from healthy cells. In treating cancer, doctors have several options. Surgery or radiotherapy is usually the start, to simply remove or target localised cancerous cells. If they have spread throughout the body, then chemotherapy is necessary: basically “nuking” the body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs target cells that divide quickly to stop tumours growing, but this means they also kill off healthy cells in hair follicles, the stomach lining and bone marrow. It’s a blunt and barbaric intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immunotherapy is a more targeted approach: its aim is to prime the immune system to attack only cancerous cells. Most of the research efforts here have focused on developing targeted vaccines and drugs for specific cancers, which means a long and expensive process of testing for safety, efficacy and dosage. But what appears to happen with mRNA vaccines is something different: it looks as if they activate the immune system in general, and this helps the body fight cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US looked at the medical records of patients with stage 3 and stage 4 lung cancer treated between 2015 and 2022 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Of those, 180 patients had received a Covid mRNA vaccine – either Pfizer or Moderna – within 100 days of starting immunotherapy treatment. In this observational study, the researchers compared them with 704 patients who had the same drugs but did not have the Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After controlling for age, disease severity and other confounding factors, the results were striking: vaccinated patients lived a median of 37.3 months compared with 20.6 months in the unvaccinated group. Three years after starting treatment, 55.7% of vaccinated patients were alive compared with 30.8% of those who weren’t. A similar pattern was found when looking at a second group of patients with metastatic melanoma (a skin cancer that has spread around the body). The same benefit was found regardless of whether it was Pfizer or Moderna, but not in non-mRNA Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The gains are significant and far beyond the norm for most cancer drugs. A study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333065/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reviewing the clinical impact&lt;/a&gt; of 124 new cancer drugs approved by the US FDA between 2003 and 2021 found that, on average, new drugs increased median overall survival only by 2.8 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To delve deeper into these findings, scientists studied the impact of mRNA vaccines in mice. They found that pairing an mRNA vaccine with immunotherapy helped activate the immune system and turn previously hidden (“cold”) tumours into recognisable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What could explain this? The researchers suggest that mRNA vaccines act as a flare, activating immune cells throughout the body. This doesn’t directly target cancer, but primes the immune system to be more alert and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these findings are confirmed in other studies, this could revolutionise how cancer is treated. As &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/study-finds-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-sparks-immune-response-to-fight-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Elias Sayour,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and a co-author of the study, said: “We could design an even better non-specific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all patients.” Because Covid mRNA vaccines have already been tested for safety in millions of people, researchers see potential in repurposing them as a low-risk, inexpensive way to boost the immune system alongside traditional cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Matters of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"matters-of-opinion","successDescription":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The findings come from an observational study – that is, looking back at medical records of patients, rather than one designed from the ground up to test this effect – meaning it can show association, not causation. Randomised control trials (or RCTs) are needed to confirm whether it is indeed the vaccine making the difference. Animal studies are also needed to further examine the exact biological mechanism beyond just general immune system activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just imagine having more precise and effective cancer treatments without the heavy toll and side-effects of chemotherapy. I remember my father suffering through round after round of chemo and wondering if the cure was worse than the disease. The Nature study is a reminder that science often advances in surprising ways. The mRNA Covid vaccines may not only have saved lives during the pandemic – they might also save lives from cancer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhv1l78i001tpwksmo3xa1hv@published"&gt;So many people resent their parents for a lack of “fairness.” How do you handle “fairness” situations with your children when the circumstances are both similar and completely different? I have three kids, “Anna” (27), “Ben” (25), and “Caroline” (22). In most ways they received resources comparably growing up, but now unevenness is rearing its ugly head.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5n29u000m3b77x8oebagu@published"&gt;My company pays for the employees’ health insurance and then the employee can add (and pay for) additional insurance, including for kids. “Kids” insurance costs the same if you have one kid or six kids. When Anna and Ben graduated college and started working, I kept them on my insurance because I was already purchasing the “Kids” insurance for Caroline. Anna switched to her own insurance at 26 and Ben will be 26 soon and do the same. Caroline now has a full-time job with benefits, including insurance. Her insurance is not free, but costs significantly less than “Kids” at my company. I never had a stated plan to insure my children until they were 26—it just worked out that way for my older children and didn’t cost me any additional money. But it’s clearly a benefit they received courtesy of me that Caroline won’t receive.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5meu7000d3b77zq1ue6wb@published"&gt;So what’s fair/even? Birth order just is, and there are perks and disadvantages to all the spots? Caroline should get a subsidy from me to help with her insurance, even though I didn’t spend any extra money on her siblings? Just let it play out because no one can say who will need help with something else along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mezj000g3b77sg9l8bf7@published"&gt;Fairness doesn’t mean you have to do the exact same thing for all of your adult children. Support comes in different shapes, and for Anna and Ben, it just made sense to handle insurance the way you did. It didn’t cost you extra, so it wasn’t intended as preferential treatment. Caroline’s situation is different, and that’s just a matter of timing and how the plan is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mf1e000h3b77ucah5a7w@published"&gt;No, you don’t need to somehow make up for this by paying for Caroline’s insurance, especially if it’s something that she easily afford herself. Life is not this transactional, and there are plenty of other ways you can offer and show support—financial or otherwise—when she needs it. Over the years, each of your kids is going to have a different need. One of them might want to go to grad school. One of them might have kids and need childcare. If you spend all of your time keeping track of who gets what and trying to even it out with the others, you’ll drive yourself nuts. But what you can do is commit to being equitable over the long run. You’ll help each of your kids when it makes sense, when it’s within your means, and in ways that fit their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My friend Emma has a spreadsheet tracking every book she's read since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows exactly how many pages she read each month, which genres dominated each year, and can tell you her average star rating for any author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's never mentioned this to anyone at work. Never posted about it online. Never brought it up at parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stumbled onto it accidentally while we were sharing screens during a video call, she laughed and said, "Oh, that. Yeah, I just like keeping track."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked why she'd never mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because the second I do, it becomes a thing people have opinions about. Someone will ask why I'm not on Goodreads. Someone else will want to compare numbers. It stops being mine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I realized something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart introverts don't hide their hobbies because they're ashamed. They protect them because they understand that some things lose their magic when they're performed for an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hobbies that matter most are the ones that exist purely for you, in the quiet spaces where no one's watching and no one's keeping score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Keeping detailed personal records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma's book spreadsheet isn't unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know introverts who track their coffee consumption, log every concert they attend, catalog their plant growth, or maintain decade-long journals about their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't productivity hacks or self-improvement projects. They're personal archeology. Ways of paying attention to your own life that don't make sense to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started keeping a running list of every meal I cook. Not recipes. Just the names of dishes and the date I made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned it once at dinner, someone immediately asked, "Why? What's the point?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn't have a good answer. Because the point is that there is no point. It's just something I do because I like having a record. Because it helps me notice patterns. Because it makes me feel connected to my own history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Creating elaborate fantasy worlds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for writing projects or D&amp;amp;D campaigns. Just for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who's been building a fictional city in their head for fifteen years. They have maps. Political systems. History. Family trees for characters who will never appear in any story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked why they don't write a novel, they said, "Because I don't want to. I just like thinking about it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds odd to people who only create things meant to be shared. But for introverts, the act of imagining can be its own complete experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My version of this is designing hypothetical restaurants. Full concepts with menus, floor plans, staff structures, and seasonal specials. I've never worked in a restaurant. I have no plans to open one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on long walks or before falling asleep, I think about how I'd organize the kitchen, what the signature dish would be, how the space would feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a sandbox for my brain. A place where I can control every variable and explore ideas without the friction of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Mastering obscure skills nobody asked for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met someone at a party who could identify most birds by their calls. Not because they're a birder or work in environmental science. Just because they find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't bring it up. I only learned about it because we were standing outside and they casually said, "That's a white-throated sparrow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked how they knew, they shrugged and said, "I just started paying attention a few years ago."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts collect these kinds of skills quietly. Learning to identify typefaces. Memorizing the periodic table for fun. Studying old maps of cities they'll never visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no utilitarian goal. No career application. No impressive party trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the private satisfaction of knowing something deeply because it interested them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught myself to identify about forty common mushrooms. Not to forage. Just to notice. When I'm walking in the woods, I like being able to name what I'm seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never told most people about this because the first question is always, "Are you going to start foraging?" And then I have to explain that no, I just wanted to know. And that always sounds insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's the thing about introvert hobbies. They don't need to be sufficient for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Collecting things that have no monetary value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not vintage watches or rare vinyl. Things like ticket stubs. Interesting rocks. Screenshots of beautiful color combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner collects pictures of interesting doors. Just doors they see while traveling or walking around the city. Thousands of them. Organized by color and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Instagram account. No coffee table book in progress. Just a folder on their phone they look through sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone once asked what they collect, they said "nothing really," because explaining would require justifying why doors are worth noticing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts understand that some collections only make sense internally. The value isn't in rarity or investment potential. It's in the act of noticing, selecting, and keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a document where I save sentences I like. Not quotes from famous people. Just sentences from novels, articles, or overheard conversations that struck me as beautiful or true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably never do anything with them. But having them there, in a place only I visit, feels like keeping company with thoughts that mattered to me once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Developing elaborate personal systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who has a color-coded system for organizing their thoughts. Not for work projects. For everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue for things they're curious about. Green for things that made them happy. Red for things that frustrated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keep these in a private app no one else uses. It's not efficient. It's not shareable. It's just theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts love building systems that only they understand because the system itself is an extension of how their mind works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tagging system for articles I save that makes sense to no one but me. Tags like "winter feeling" or "good pacing" or "makes me want to write."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I tried to explain the taxonomy to someone else, it would sound arbitrary. But for me, it's a perfect map of my internal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems like this don't scale. They're not meant to. They exist purely as a tool for one person to make sense of their own experience, and that specificity is what makes them powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Practicing skills that will never be performed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing guitar alone in your bedroom with no intention of ever playing for others. Perfecting a recipe no one else will taste. Learning to draw but never showing anyone the drawings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't hobbies with a showcase at the end. They're practices that exist entirely in the doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been teaching myself to letter by hand. Not calligraphy for wedding invitations. Just writing out quotes or poems in careful, deliberate handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't post them. I don't frame them. Sometimes I throw them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For extroverts, this often doesn't compute. Why put in the hours if no one will see it? But for introverts, removing the performance pressure is exactly what makes the practice sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something exists only for you, you can be mediocre at it. You can plateau and not care. You can do it badly on purpose just to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a freedom in that. A kind of creative play that only exists when the stakes are private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Engaging in deep solo research on random topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for school or work. Just because something caught their attention and they want to understand it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introvert I know spent six months researching the history of parking meters. Why they were invented. How they changed cities. The politics around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't write a book. Didn't even write an essay. They just wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from the internet rabbit hole we all fall into. This is sustained, deliberate curiosity pursued over time with no external motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once spent three months reading everything I could about the history of fermentation. Not because I was starting a business or writing an article. Just because I wanted to understand how humans figured out that letting food rot in specific ways made it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research felt indulgent. I kept thinking I should be doing something more productive. But the deep satisfaction of understanding something just because I wanted to is hard to replicate in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introverts do this because they value understanding as its own reward. They don't need the research to lead somewhere. The knowing is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about introvert hobbies: they're not secrets because they're shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're private because privacy protects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second you share something you love, it enters the realm of judgment, comparison, and external expectation. People want to know why you do it. Whether you're good at it. What you're going to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes the answer is just: nothing. I do it because I like it. Because it's mine.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, it turns out gluten might not the actual culprit. Recent research published in The Lancet has redirected the blame away from gluten, and onto another ingredient behind bread‑related bloating and gas. The investigators highlight fructans-a class of carbohydrates embedded in wheat and a host of grains, as the likely issue. Fructans sit within the FODMAP family (Fermentable Oligo‑, Di‑, Mono‑saccharides and Polyols), a group of short‑chain carbs, that are often only partially absorbed, and then fermented by gut bacteria, producing the gas and abdominal discomfort many people experience. What this discovery underscores is the need to tailor diets to each individual, rather than resorting to a blanket ban on gluten. Let us learn more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What exactly are fructans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fructans are a type of carbohydrate, composed of linked units that form chains. They appear in a variety of foods-wheat, onions, garlic and even some fruits. Unlike gluten, which is a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11373345/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, fructans are fibers that largely pass through the small intestine untouched. When they finally reach the colon, gut bacteria ferment them, releasing gases such as hydrogen and methane along with short‑chain fatty acids. This fermentation can bring on stomach discomfort, and extra gas in people, who are particularly sensitive, or who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or non‑celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Bloated tummy woes? Common remedies to get rid of gas and bloating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What the Lancet study and other investigations reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, a notable randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial examined those who believed they were gluten‑sensitive, yet tested negative for disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators tested gluten and fructan effects separately, by handing participants bars that contained either gluten, fructans, or an inert placebo. The findings were striking: the fructan‑laden bars triggered gastrointestinal distress-bloating, excess gas and abdominal pain. Strangely enough, the gluten‑only bars didn’t produce symptoms any worse, than the placebo. The data suggest that, for many who hold gluten responsible for their issues, fructans might actually be the instigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why Fructans result in bloating and gas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classified as a FODMAP, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29102613/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;fructans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; draw fluid into the intestine by virtue of their pull, and once they reach the large bowel, they are swiftly broken down by resident microbes. This rapid fermentation churns out gas, causing the colon to swell. The resulting stretch can irritate the gut wall and set off nerve signaling, which amplifies the usual complaints-bloating, abdominal pain and erratic bowel movements, whether diarrhea or constipation, in people who are particularly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gluten, vs. Fructans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people point the finger at gluten when wheat‑type foods cause stomach troubles. Yet, gluten shares the stage with fructans in those foods. A gluten‑free regimen typically trims the fructan load as well, blurring the lines on which is more harmful than the other. Consequently, setting apart the real trigger, becomes a challenge. In some cases, eliminating gluten barely makes a difference, because the lingering fructans keep the system on edge. Recognizing fructan intolerance or sensitivity, offers a better-targeted dietary approach, such as limiting high-FODMAP foods rather than unnecessary gluten avoidance, which can be restrictive and nutritionally limiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Personalised meal plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this insight, dietary plans need to be individualized for individuals who have a sensitive stomach, rather than imposing a one‑size‑fits‑all gluten‑free regime. People who struggle with bloating and gas, may find a low‑FODMAP approach-one that trims fructans and other fermentable carbs, more beneficial. On the other hand, foods high in fructans, such as wheat, onions, garlic and certain fruits can be, swapped for alternatives. Enlisting a dietitian versed in FODMAP management, can shape an eating plan that eases symptoms without too many restrictions, bolstering gut health and overall quality of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5859228/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwJBVV95cUxObGpwTVZTNm1EMk10NXBKWXdHd1p2X2M2VnJwVGNTT0J3NzZ2Y1VnZG5QRklMV2ZHcGRHUGthTDdpMDE1RVZKRTFvN19fWENEa1Zta2xTZDV6N214ZWlCaWRxNXFrNUltM1Z4VWpXQWFHRy1OUS1TWTVWNEZlR0ZrS3NNdXRtaDFWc1J0czJrOW9BU1JLb0NOVFhrRU1VVVNESnhPOEd0RlhoWEc2V2p2YkkzemtjbEVTelF6SkJmTWVOUldpbXpVblM4X1dHazhVcHJfeE81RzZ4UEo4cGFLeDA2UE1PcTNfcWlYNHZmY05CT21HcTVYQzNYbVl0LVZJYWJrZ0tjMkhlaGFjSENXMzZSZw</guid></item><item><title>我是一名全科医生，这是6个永远不应该被忽视的男性健康红旗-赫芬顿邮报英国</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mens-health-red-flags_uk_69145b70e4b0c37fa3d2593c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/business/health-horizons/silent-crisis-in-mens-health" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bupa" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69145b70e4b0c37fa3d2593c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bupa.co.uk/business/health-horizons/silent-crisis-in-mens-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Bupa&lt;/a&gt;, men are facing a ‘silent crisis’.

&lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization, which serves as the World Health Organization’s regional office for the Americas, made this announcement after the agency’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2024.93"&gt;measles elimination commission&lt;/a&gt; met in Mexico City to review the latest public health data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://hs.richmond.edu/faculty/kjacobse/"&gt;global health epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt; who studies the spread of infectious diseases, this change in status does not surprise me. Measles is highly contagious, and a drop in childhood vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and in other countries has left many children unprotected from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of measles in Canada after decades with very low numbers of cases &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-could-again-become-widespread-as-cases-surge-worldwide-255501"&gt;is not an isolated problem&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. has also had &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-cases-are-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-make-sure-youre-protected-252277"&gt;large outbreaks of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;, and it will likely soon lose its measles-free designation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of measles elimination status is a symptom of a deeper issue: &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/from-drew-altman/the-problem-isnt-trust-in-vaccines-its-that-people-dont-know-who-to-trust/"&gt;declining trust&lt;/a&gt; in public messaging about science and health, which has led to decreased vaccination rates and growing vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean for a country to be measles-free?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet. Before the measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination"&gt;licensed for use in 1963&lt;/a&gt;, nearly every child got measles infection and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;more than 2 million children died&lt;/a&gt; from measles each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine decreased that risk dramatically. By 1968, five years after the vaccine became available, case counts in the U.S. had &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death"&gt;dropped by more than 95%&lt;/a&gt;. Cases in Canada also &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles/health-professionals-measles.html"&gt;decreased substantially&lt;/a&gt; after the vaccine was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;about 100,000 children still die from measles&lt;/a&gt; each year even though a safe, effective and low-cost vaccine is available. Almost all of those deaths occur in low-income countries where many children do not have access to recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization uses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2622975/"&gt;three labels to describe&lt;/a&gt; how well a country is preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as measles. A disease is said to be controlled when public health interventions such as routine childhood vaccinations significantly lower the rate of new infections. A disease is considered to be eliminated from a country when the only cases that happen are small outbreaks linked to international travel. And finally, a disease is deemed eradicated only after several years of no cases occurring anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the status of measles elimination, a country must have no ongoing local transmission of the disease &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;for at least one year&lt;/a&gt;. It will lose that status if it has a chain of cases that spread from person to person for more than one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a country has eliminated measles, there is almost no risk from the disease as long as vaccination rates stay high. But when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks will soon start happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What happened in Canada?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the Pan American Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/these-doctors-helped-eliminate-measles-in-98-heres-how-they-did-it/"&gt;confirmed that Canada had eliminated measles transmission&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, the U.S. also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;gained the measles-free designation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2016, every country in the Americas had achieved measles elimination status. The region &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2024.93"&gt;lost that status in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela, and then &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles"&gt;regained it in 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01037-2"&gt;have been falling worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect communities from measles outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;about 95% of the population&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the percentage of 2-year-olds who have received at least one dose of measles vaccine dropped from about 90% in 2019 to &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;about 82% in 2022 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of unvaccinated people in the population increased, the risk of measles outbreaks grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having only 16 total cases of measles nationwide between 2020 and 2023, the number of measles cases in Canada jumped to more than 100 in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/"&gt;more than 5,000 cases in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Cases have occurred among infants, children and adults in every Canadian province in 2025, and two infants have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10% of the people who have gotten sick had been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that both the U.S. and Mexico will lose their measles-free designation in 2026, because both countries have had &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-31-fold-americas-region-year"&gt;sustained outbreaks of measles&lt;/a&gt; since early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;more than 90% of kindergartners in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; are vaccinated against measles, that rate is too low to protect communities from outbreaks. An &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/texas-records-first-us-measles-death-in-10-years-a-medical-epidemiologist-explains-how-to-protect-yourself-and-your-community-from-this-deadly-preventable-disease-251004"&gt;outbreak that started in Texas&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;infected more than 760 people&lt;/a&gt; and caused the deaths of two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,600 Americans&lt;/a&gt; in more than 40 states have gotten sick from measles in 2025. That is more cases than any year since 1992. More than 90% of the people who got sick were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico has also had &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/informe-diario-del-brote-de-sarampion-en-mexico-2025"&gt;thousands of measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, mostly among unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central America, South America and the Caribbean will retain their measles-free status for now. But the outbreaks in North America increase the risk of measles spreading to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a significant improvement in vaccination coverage and public trust in community health measures, many countries are likely to face more, and bigger, outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the coming years.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269090/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, it doesn't take an engineer to realize that not every material is safe for direct transfer to the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceramic is generally microwave safe, right? Many plastics can be placed in the microwave, but are they actually OK for your health? And paper doesn't catch on fire in the microwave's super-powered chamber, but should you actually put it in there, like, ever? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we don't have a grip on what is absolutely never suitable for the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microwave safe doesn't just mean a container will not melt or warp, but it also means it will not release or leach harmful chemicals into our food when heated," says Li Li, associate professor at the &lt;a href="https://www.unr.edu/public-health/people/li-li" target="_self"&gt;University of Nevada, Reno School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, whose specialty is environmental health and exposure science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with materials and health experts about what to do when it comes to exposing various kitchen containers and packaging materials to the electromagnetic radiation of your microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best practices for using containers in the microwave&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styrofoam and your microwave are a dangerous combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;GoodLifeStudio/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the specific materials and their numerous variables regarding suitability for microwave use, consider the following best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Look for microwave-safe labels only as a starting point&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some materials are generally safe for microwave use, it's still a good habit to look for a "microwave safe" indication of some kind. However, bear in mind that this designation doesn't tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/how-long-past-the-expiration-date-can-you-eat-food-an-expert-weighs-in/" target="_self"&gt;expiration dates on food&lt;/a&gt;, the microwave-safe label isn't based on a federal certification program. "Manufacturers can use it if their own testing shows it meets the microwave-safe standards in their own minds. It is a helpful guideline, but not a guarantee," Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, that label doesn't necessarily indicate any risks to human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Toss all damaged containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damaged food containers can leach chemicals into food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damaged containers can potentially lead to the leaching of chemicals or toxins in your food. They may also malfunction due to the vibration of electromagnetic waves on which the microwave's functionality relies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether a container is indicated to be microwave-safe, and regardless of the material, discard it if it's not in good condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's scratched, pitted, cracked or otherwise damaged, then you can no longer assume that it is safe to use in a microwave," says Kelly Johnson-Arbor, toxicologist for &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/" target="_self"&gt;MedStar Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don't go from the freezer to the microwave&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frozen containers, especially plastic ones, shouldn't go in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;airdone/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While moving from the refrigerator to the microwave is generally OK for most materials, you should avoid sudden temperature changes, says Li. Allowing a moment on the countertop for a glass or ceramic container can help reduce the shock once it's in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never move from the freezer straight to the microwave," Li says. "Such major temperature changes can cause cracking," which immediately compromises the food inside the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Be cautious with decorative elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you're working with a microwave-safe material, be wary of containers or bowls that have excessive decoration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterned conventional ceramics are typically fine, but "be cautious with decorative coatings or metallic trims, as they can spark or break down when overheated," Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best microwave-safe options: glass and ceramic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass and ceramic containers are generally safe to use in a microwave oven, according to Johnson-Arbor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both act as insulators, meaning that they are resistant to heat transfer," she says, so the vessels themselves don't get hot, while the electromagnetic waves work to heat the food contained within them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to tolerating high heat, "glass and ceramic containers usually do not contain organic chemical additives," says Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glass&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass containers are safe as long as rubber or plastic lids don't come in direct contact with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many glass storage containers have lids with a rubber or plastic element, these are generally fine as long as those elements don't come into contact with the food. (But be sure to clean thoroughly so that rubber seals don't develop mold.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for the best possible option, casserole dishes with glass tops and no seals are ideal vessels for microwave cooking and reheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="542633e1-3d71-46f5-a5ac-48c0a5e79964" data-cy="shortcodeListicle" data-id="listicle-542633e1-3d71-46f5-a5ac-48c0a5e79964" data-location="LIST" data-position="1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-border-thin-light-top g-inner-spacing-bottom-medium g-inner-spacing-left-large g-inner-spacing-right-large g-inner-spacing-bottom-xlarge c-shortcodeListicle-notInfoCard g-outer-spacing-bottom-large g-border-thin-light-bottom g-border-thin-light-right g-border-thin-light-left"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_text"&gt;     &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek c-shortcodeListicleDek c-shortcodeListicleDek-inline g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For safely nuking food, glass is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ceramic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceramic containers are some of the safest options for microwaving food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Qwart/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial ceramics are generally microwave-safe and should be labeled as such, but be sure to double-check those that are more decorative or artisan-made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The glazes found on some ceramic products can contain heavy metals, including lead," says Johnson-Arbor.

"But in recent years, scientists have discovered that tiny plastic particles, called microplastics, can leach out from food storage containers when heated." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/accidentally-eating-plastic-common-foods-more-likely-contain-microplastics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; entered the conversation, many brands have claimed to be "BPA-free" to ease consumers' minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Polycarbonate food containers are made from a group of chemicals called bisphenols," says Li. Bisphenol A is commonly referred to as BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BPA is known to interfere with hormones and has been linked to some endocrine-disrupting effects," he says. "Even though polycarbonate can physically handle high temperatures, meeting the 'microwave safe' requirement for manufacturers, microwave heating speeds up the release of BPA, especially when the container is scratched, reused many times, or holds fatty or acidic foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/home/microplastics-could-be-leaching-into-your-food-if-youre-making-this-simple-mistake/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microplastics Could Be Leaching Into Your Food if You're Making This Simple Mistake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA-free containers are marginally better, according to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Polypropylene, often called 'PP plastic' or labeled '#5 plastic,' is generally a better option," says Li. "It has good heat resistance and tends to contain fewer additives compared to other plastics. That said, fewer doesn't mean none, and it still uses some chemicals like antioxidants or stabilizers during manufacturing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest possible stance? "Since the overall impact of microplastics on our health is still unknown, some people choose to entirely avoid using plastic food containers in microwave ovens," says Johnson-Arbor, which is the safest possible stance, regardless of whether something is BPA-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic wrap, which is generally approved for use in the microwave due to its heat tolerance, &lt;a href="https://osteopathic.org/what-is-osteopathic-medicine/microwaves-and-plastics/#:~:text=Although%20certain%20types%20of%20plastic,paper%20or%20white%20paper%20towels." target="_self"&gt;should never come into direct contact with food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to give up the convenience and budget-friendly nature of BPA-free plastic storage containers (and you're committed to taking responsible care of them and tossing them if they get scratched), here's a set we have previously recommended.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paper comes with a catch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decorative and colored paper plates should stay out of the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Dorling Kindersley:Dave King/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have several types of paper on hand in your kitchen, including paper towels, wax paper, parchment paper, butcher paper and even a variety of paper plates for festive occasions. Should you put any of it in the microwave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most everyday uses, plain white paper towels or paper plates are generally safe to use in the microwave," says Li. A paper towel is a handy cover for reheating food on ceramic plates, helping to avoid splatter without resorting to plastic wrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's also a catch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should avoid microwaving colored or decorated paper plates, brown grocery or take-out bags, and any paper plates that have a water- or oil-resistant coating," he says. "This is because we cannot exclude the possibility that they can smoke, melt or release unwanted chemicals when heated." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same holds true for wax paper, which can melt or degrade at high temperatures or when in contact with certain types of food. If a paper product has a shiny or smooth side, best to avoid it as a general rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metals are never microwave safe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep all metal, including aluminum foil, out of the microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to microwave cooking, metals are unsafe not because of health or heat tolerance reasons. Stainless steel and cast iron are excellent materials for stovetop cooking, but they can't be placed in the microwave due to the way microwaves operate. Putting them in the microwave is both counterproductive and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metal reflects the electromagnetic waves," explains Johnson-Arbor, which prevents them from actually heating your food. "This can cause heat to transfer to other surfaces in the microwave, potentially causing overheating or a fire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPbHJXUmwwUGFQdnEzMHZ3LXFZNFRMSVlPeDhQQk5FdkYydnFVeVA0dUlXSVlQYmFBNXp3V0lya1gzUkI3YVByNDZSYTMxcFFvNlRYLW9GOUFodG8yeVFOR2xORmxPT2poaExhc0ZvYWxYOE9oLVduT1VhWVN3aWluN1RSTGN4dW8ycUJ4NUV4dmk5UFZEVmRqUnR5VlZTUXBnODVLdmNIYXVMeUNhMXY4U2p4X1B5ZEhZVnRIenhONEk</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：女性自制果汁导致危及生命的“毒性南瓜综合症” - Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/diagnostic-dilemma-a-womans-homemade-juice-led-to-life-threatening-toxic-squash-syndrome</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

She said she'd made and drunk juice from store-bought calabash every day for years, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6010206218391403639&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs43678-022-00358-1%3Fsharing_token%3DM88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-womans-homemade-juice-led-to-life-threatening-toxic-squash-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s43678-022-00358-1?sharing_token=M88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%3D" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs43678-022-00358-1%3Fsharing_token%3DM88RurWGxRwnAAE1ZpV35fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6If_4yVadHPMkR41YK-4K16nXLnpWfaofaloohV50DnSsSHGitsrhdx9OIBmDH-kMbLAF8H6Ak5YEsyNaKVyrfyRgnheRVX60lFkvmWa_P5wBrom-5vtp0xqC9O_2grc8%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-womans-homemade-juice-led-to-life-threatening-toxic-squash-syndrome" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, on this occasion, she noted that it tasted "abnormally bitter," rather than having its more typical mild squash flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5ccb0a16-d472-4f98-baf8-461aa46a14d6"&gt;Tests revealed that the woman's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and breathing rate were high, and her blood pressure was initially high and then fell concerningly low. Her extremities were also unusually cool to the touch, indicating she had poor circulation. Meanwhile, one of the chambers of her heart was pumping very forcefully, and an echocardiogram suggested she was having other heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team restored the woman's blood pressure to normal levels by giving her intravenous fluids, but she still subsequently had several episodes of "profound" low pressure. She also continued to experience diarrhea and vomited blood several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where doctors examined her gastrointestinal tract via gastroscopy, in which a thin tube with a camera in it is inserted into the mouth and guided into the throat and stomach. They found that her stomach lining was inflamed and bleeding as a result of tissue damage, which was likely caused by poor oxygen delivery to the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient was diagnosed with shock, a life-threatening condition in which blood flow starkly declines and ultimately injures organs. In this case, the shock stemmed from toxins in the squash juice. This "bitter bottle gourd poisoning" is a type of "toxic squash syndrome," which is caused by eating toxic substances sometimes found in squashes and gourds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cETSP26NcEF8UBhSmqRwK4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cETSP26NcEF8UBhSmqRwK4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calabash is specifically a "cucurbit," meaning it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family that includes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51000-cucumber-nutrition.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51000-cucumber-nutrition.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cucumbers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, pumpkins, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/46019-watermelon-nutrition.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/46019-watermelon-nutrition.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watermelon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and zucchini. Cucurbits produce &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/cucurbitacins.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/cucurbitacins.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bitter-tasting chemicals called cucurbitacins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can have toxic effects if consumed in large enough quantities. Domesticated varieties of these plants have been bred to contain minimal quantities of cucurbitacins so that they're both palatable and safe for humans to eat. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/#sec3" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/#sec3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;But in some cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cucurbits may accumulate these chemicals as they ripen, posing a rare risk to people who consume them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If ingested, cucurbitacin is toxic to humans by various purported albeit uncertain mechanisms," the report authors noted. The toxin is thought to disrupt signaling in cells and make blood vessels more permeable, and it ultimately injures mucous membranes in the body, especially in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is suspected that the gourd’s degree of bitterness correlates with its cucurbitacin concentration and thus toxicity; however, this is not definitively supported in the literature," the authors added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no specific antidote to bitter-gourd poisoning, so the medical team continued to monitor the patient's vital signs and stabilize them as needed. Her shock and associated symptoms went away after she'd spent five days in the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was then discharged, and on a follow-up call, she reported sudden and progressive hair loss that set in about two weeks after she'd been admitted to the hospital. The doctors noted that this is another likely symptom of "bitter bottle gourd poisoning and further supported this diagnosis." Hair loss has been reported in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/62158-toxic-squash-syndrome-hair-loss.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/62158-toxic-squash-syndrome-hair-loss.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other cases of the syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2204062e-a0bc-46a7-991e-e7c146997b16"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Toxic squash syndrome is considered very rare, and this was the first such case ever reported in Canada. Similar cases had previously been reported in other countries, such as India, where calabash juice is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9648242/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;used in some forms of traditional medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="6d17fac5-d171-4c7e-b232-ebe076c2ac8a"&gt;

However, by its original definition, diet is the opposite of temporary – it is the food you habitually eat. To support long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, you need to establish long-term healthy eating patterns, but with the amount of noise around nutrition nowadays, that is easier said than done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do it successfully, pays to swerve trends and instead focus on simply prioritising certain health-promoting foods. As a &lt;a href="/author/harry-bullmore"&gt;fitness writer&lt;/a&gt;, nearly all of the nutrition-minded academics, researchers, authors, dietitians, nutritionists and trainers I regularly speak to tend to agree on a selection of items you should be eating to live better for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains,” writes Adrián Carballo Casla of the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. “Choose healthy fats like rapeseed oil and fish. Limit red and processed meats, sugary drinks and solid fats.” These findings come from a recent study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00929-8&amp;amp;articleId=b2862364&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; journal. The foods listed above, Carballo Casla continues, are the foundations of diets associated with “slower ageing, better brain health and fewer chronic diseases”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ageing is inevitable, but people can shape how it unfolds,” he concludes. “Our findings suggest that even small changes in diet can make a meaningful difference in how people experience later life, regardless of their age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The common denominators of a healthy diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appropriate calorie consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritise nutritious wholefoods &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A wide variety of fruits and vegetables &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid excessive consumption of processed meats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sufficient protein intake through lean sources &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plenty of plant-based fibre sources – aim for 30g or more of fibre per day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid excessive consumption of refined grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limited alcohol intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/bold-bean-co-gut-health-recipes-b2842333.html"&gt;How fibremaxxing became the secret to better gut-health and easy recipes to use now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/21/iStock-1451277246.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/21/iStock-1451277246.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/21/iStock-1451277246.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="It can be hard to know what to prioritise when trying to build a healthy diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-671271"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 jBbosc hgzWpY"&gt;It can be hard to know what to prioritise when trying to build a healthy diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 kiHhhg"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aging Research Center’s study followed more than 2,400 Swedish adults aged 60 and above for 15 years. Participants followed one of four existing dietary patterns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The MIND is an a priori-defined score based on the foods and nutrients shown to be protective for dementia. Many of its dietary components are those of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, including emphasis on minimally processed plant-based foods and limited consumption of animal and high-saturated-fat foods.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AHEI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The AHEI is based on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and discussions with nutrition researchers to identify foods and nutrients that have been consistently associated with lower risk of chronic disease in clinical and epidemiological investigations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The AMED is based on the Mediterranean Diet Score, which reflects adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. It incorporates several modifications based on dietary patterns and eating behaviours that have been associated with lower risk of chronic disease in clinical and epidemiological studies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The EDII assesses diet quality based on its inflammatory potential. It is a weighted sum of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory food groups and has been found to predict concentrations of plasma inflammatory markers. Unlike the other three dietary patterns, higher adherence to EDII indicates a less healthy diet.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first three “healthy” dietary patterns “showed a protective association with the speed of accumulation of chronic diseases [such as heart disease, diabetes and depression] in older adults over time”. The EDII diet, on the other hand, had a negative impact in this area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study findings highlight the potential role of diet in the prevention of multimorbidity expansion in older populations, with possible implications for dietary guidelines, other public health strategies and clinical practice,” the paper concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, as Carballo Casla puts it: “We found that people who consistently ate a healthy diet developed chronic diseases more slowly, in contrast to those whose diets were considered more inflammatory; that is, diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks, which are known to promote low-grade chronic inflammation in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/weekly-food-shop-prices-cost-of-living-inflation-b2845761.html"&gt;How the £100 weekly shop became a viral trend – and reveals the true cost of living crisis in the UK today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ghzTpl"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/28/00/30125203-65b6c82e-e5d9-465d-801d-8ee22451c12c.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/28/00/30125203-65b6c82e-e5d9-465d-801d-8ee22451c12c.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/28/00/30125203-65b6c82e-e5d9-465d-801d-8ee22451c12c.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Research from the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden found diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-671272"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 jBbosc hgzWpY"&gt;Research from the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden found diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 kiHhhg"&gt; (iStock/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we’re getting wrong about inflammation &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a word that crops up a lot nowadays, with many food adverts crowing about their product’s anti-inflammatory capabilities. What is less publicised is what this actually means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation is actually not a bad thing,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/prof_valterlongo/?hl=en"&gt;Dr Valter Longo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the University of Southern California Longevity Institute. “It is part of the human body’s response to attack – to attack bacteria or cancer cells, or to try to clear up junk that’s accumulated somewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a whole set of cells and cytokines to get that done. Let’s say there’s a wound; you would have an inflammatory response because your system wants to fight infectious agents and repair the wound.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Karolinska Institutet’s study finds that “a diet high in inflammatory foods was linked to faster accumulation [of chronic diseases]”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem [with inflammation] is, as you get older, the process can get disrupted and it can continue when it shouldn’t continue,” Dr Longo explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrongly believing there is an infection of invasion, the cells of the immune system and cytokines continue in attack mode, damaging healthy tissues including those in the heart, brain and joints. This is how inflammation can contribute to a range of chronic diseases such as autoimmune disease and rheumatoid arthritis, says Dr Longo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The inflammation is at its best a healing process, but at its worst the consequences of inflammation can ramify through the body,” adds Professor David Nutt, a leading neuropsychopharmacologist specialising in drugs that affect the brain, and co-founder of alcohol alternative &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com/?cuid=xid:fr1762789609301iid&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsentiaspirits.com%2Fpages%2Fabout&amp;amp;articleId=b2846549&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Sentia&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many disorders, which we call autoimmune disorders, where the body’s own immune inflammatory response attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you get a cold, it drags you down a bit, and when people had Covid, a lot of them had severe depression and anxiety – that’s through inflammation. Alcohol produces the same kind of inflammation in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, limiting or completely removing alcohol from your diet is another piece of advice I have consistently encountered for improved health and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/upfs-ultra-processed-foods-supermarket-guide-b2815660.html"&gt;The five ultra-processed food ingredients to avoid on packaging – and what to buy instead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/24/iStock-964325260-(1).jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/24/iStock-964325260-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/24/iStock-964325260-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Legumes are another food often recommended by nutrition and longevity specialists" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-671273"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 jBbosc hgzWpY"&gt;Legumes are another food often recommended by nutrition and longevity specialists&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 kiHhhg"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The common denominators of a healthy diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Longo’s “longevity diet”, which he recommends for better health and a longer life, shares many of its roots with the Karolinska Institutet’s recent conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It almost completely eliminates red meat, it keeps white meat very low, and fish is eaten maybe three or four times a week,” he explains. “There are lots of vegetables, lots of legumes, lots of tree nuts, wholegrain cereals and some fruits. These are some of the ingredients that, consistently all over the world, have been associated with living a longer, healthier life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does earn a prominent spot on this list is wholefoods – food that has been processed or refined as little as possible. These foods tend to be more nutritious than their processed counterparts, carrying benefits beyond their calorie count courtesy of their vitamin and mineral provisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like focusing on nutritious foods you can add into your diet because appetite is finite, so they tend to have a habit of displacing other [less nutritious] foods out of your diet,” says Ben Carpenter, an experienced trainer and author of best-selling books &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEverything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh%2Fdp%2FB0BT733QD8%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2862364%7CB0BT733QD8%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Fat Loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFat-Loss-Habits-SUNDAY-BESTSELLER%2Fdp%2F1780726058%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2862364%7C1780726058%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fat Loss Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites a study on children which found that, when they were encouraged to eat more fruit, they lost weight despite being told to eat more because it led to them eating fewer calorie-dense options such as chocolate and crisps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often nutritious foods tend to be slightly less processed – for example, fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, beans, lentils and whole grains,” Carpenter continues. “Even if you’re eating things like rice and oats as opposed to more processed versions of the equivalent grains – doughnuts, pancakes and waffles – it’s a good move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also like the idea of focusing on [encouraging people to eat more] lean sources of protein because that can have a weight management effect, an appetite regulation effect, and it can be good for fat loss and building muscle tissue, specifically if people are &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/weight-training-workout-plan-strength-b2850849.html"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/gut-health-friendly-recipes-to-boost-microbiome-b2818503.html"&gt;Six gut-friendly recipes to boost your microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fMxlyn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/09/23/19/newFile-7.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/09/23/19/newFile-7.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/09/23/19/newFile-7.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Ultra-processed food expert Professor Chris van Tulleken says they are usually identifiable by the fact that they contain an ingredient not typically found in a kitchen" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-671274"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 jBbosc hgzWpY"&gt;Ultra-processed food expert Professor Chris van Tulleken says they are usually identifiable by the fact that they contain an ingredient not typically found in a kitchen&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 kiHhhg"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods, like those referenced by Carpenter above, are a hot topic right now. Avoiding them is almost impossible, and limiting them is a hard task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts I’ve spoken to have, at best, suggested they could be OK in moderation, and at worst warned people off them wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris van Tulleken is one of the leading voices in this space, having written the best-selling book &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FUltra-Processed-People-Stuff-That-Isnt%2Fdp%2F1529900050%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2862364%7C1529900050%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He defines ultra-processed foods as anything with an ingredient “you don’t typically find in a kitchen, like an emulsifier or a flavouring”. These items, van Tulleken says, are likely to be hyperpalatable and come with a decent serving of saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories alongside other unwanted ingredients. Through these inclusions, he argues, they can have addictive properties with the power to derail a healthy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can find a way of eating real food, we’re very sure that’s better for you,” he concludes. “You don’t have to believe any of the evidence around ultra-processed food to say that’s true – that’s established in nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/emily-english-recipes-live-to-eat-cookbook-b2818554.html"&gt;Three healthy recipes from Em the Nutritionist to reset your September&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/05/21/09/iStock-1289934760.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/05/21/09/iStock-1289934760.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/05/21/09/iStock-1289934760.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A diet containing a wide variety of plant-based foods has been associated with improved gut health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-671275"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 jBbosc hgzWpY"&gt;A diet containing a wide variety of plant-based foods has been associated with improved gut health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 kiHhhg"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plant power and fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theme among expert nutrition advice is the inclusion of plenty of plant-based wholefoods in your diet – particularly those rich in fibre. This can have a positive impact in many areas such as weight management and gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One frequently recommended route to a healthier gut is to consume 30 or more different plant-based foods each week, says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com/?cuid=xid:fr1762791627734fhf&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollandandbarrett.com%2F&amp;amp;articleId=b2789919&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Holland and Barrett’s&lt;/a&gt; Emily Foster, a certified nutritionist with a master’s degree in applied sport and exercise nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within our gut microbiome, we have trillions of different microorganisms – you can think of them like a bustling, microscopic city,” she says. “There are beneficial bacteria, but also some viruses and fungi in there as well. The aim is to keep that balance in the bacteria, and also diversity within the types of bacteria that we have in our gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a really interesting study called the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00031-18"&gt;American Gut Project&lt;/a&gt; [later renamed the Microsetta Initiative], which highlighted that a more diverse diet can lead to a more diverse gut microbiome, and this is linked to a healthier gut microbiome. [To achieve this] we want to be consuming plenty of plant fibres to support our gut health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For maximum benefits, this should include a healthy dose of &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-nutrition-diet-b2789919.html"&gt;prebiotic and probiotic fibres&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2019 review in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31809-9/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that people who met the recommended daily fibre intake had significantly lower risks of dying from, or developing, chronic diseases including coronary heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, and other cancer-related illnesses, Foster adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another plant compound worth considering in your diet is polyphenols, according to Dr Karan Rajan, a medical doctor and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThis-Book-Save-Your-Life%2Fdp%2F1529136326%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2831125%7C1529136326%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Book May Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They act as antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties,” he says, adding that they are also often high in fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 review published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725000790"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal suggested that “polyphenols may exert geroprotective effects by modulating the hallmarks of ageing”. In layman’s terms, these compounds could boost longevity, having been associated with a lower risk of age-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the main ones to look out for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, catechins in tea, anthocyanins in berries, quercetin in onions and isoflavones in soya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenolic acids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, caffeic acid in coffee, ferulic acid in whole grains, and gallic acid in tea, grapes and berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proanthocyadins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found in fruits like grapes and apples, as well as cocoa and dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lignans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found in wholefoods such as flaxseeds and sesame seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stilbenes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most well-known polyphenol in this category is resveratrol in red grapes and wine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some polyphenols don’t fall into the main categories, such as curcumin, a unique curcuminoid found only in turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols can contribute to improved cardiometabolic function, possible lipid modulation and improved gut health, as well as having anti-inflammatory effects, says Dr Rajan. However,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he adds, “We can’t isolate polyphenols as the sole driver of longevity from existing evidence. Other factors such as genetics, sleep, activity, lower smoking and processed food intake all play big roles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true across the board. There are many variables at play to determine how long you live and how well you live in that time – from exercise and diet right through to socioeconomic status and even luck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as the Karolinska Institutet study states, diet and nutrition are at the forefront of factors known to influence your risk of chronic conditions.

Beyond its well-known role in supporting bone health, vitamin D influences the cardiovascular system by reducing inflammation, regulating blood pressure, and supporting healthy heart muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D levels have long been associated with increased risk of heart disease and worse outcomes following a cardiac event. Despite this connection, previous studies on vitamin D supplementation have produced inconsistent results. This inconsistency is largely due to the conventional “one-size-fits-all” dosing approach, which does not account for individual variations in vitamin D metabolism or baseline levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="30502264" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="personalised-vitamin-D-dosing" source="keywords"&gt;Personalised vitamin D dosing&lt;/keyword&gt; could maximise heart protection in cardiac patients&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-attack-risk-halved-in-adults-with-heart-disease-taking-tailored-vitamin-d-doses" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association Researchers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;emphasise that uniform dosing of vitamin D fails to address the needs of patients with heart disease. Instead, they suggest monitoring blood vitamin D levels and tailoring doses accordingly. This personalised approach ensures patients reach optimal circulating levels of the hormone, which could provide maximal protective benefits for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With heart disease remaining a leading cause of death worldwide and widespread vitamin D insufficiency affecting large populations, simple and cost-effective interventions like optimised supplementation could have a substantial impact on public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent landmark clinical trial led by Intermountain Medical Center in Utah examined 630 adults diagnosed with acute heart disease over six years, with an average follow-up of just over four years. Nearly half of the participants had previously experienced a heart attack, and more than 85 per cent had vitamin D levels below 40 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL), highlighting widespread deficiency among cardiac patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into two groups. The first group received standard care without adjustment of vitamin D levels. The second group underwent personalised supplementation guided by serial blood testing to safely maintain vitamin D levels above 40 ng/mL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D monitoring and adjustment lowers the risk of repeat heart attacks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were significant. The group receiving personalised vitamin D supplementation experienced a 52 per cent reduction in recurrent heart attacks compared with the standard care group. This effect size is remarkable in cardiovascular research and suggests that correcting vitamin D deficiency in a targeted way could be one of the most effective strategies to prevent repeat heart attacks. To achieve the full benefits of vitamin D supplementation, researchers recommend a rigorous monitoring protocol. Blood levels should be tested every three months, and doses adjusted accordingly to maintain optimal concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This personalised and vigilant approach differs from traditional fixed-dose methods, reducing the risk of both under-supplementation and excessive intake, which can cause adverse effects such as hypercalcaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D as key role in preventing repeat heart attacks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If validated by larger, peer-reviewed studies, personalised vitamin D supplementation could transform preventive cardiology. By optimising nutrient levels, doctors may significantly reduce the likelihood of recurrent heart attacks in patients with heart disease. Experts highlight that this strategy is not a replacement for standard heart care, such as lifestyle modification, cholesterol management, and prescribed medications. Rather, it is a complementary approach that leverages the body’s natural hormonal pathways to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to protect your heart in relation to low Vitamin D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular sunlight exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is primarily produced in the skin when exposed to sunlight. Spending 15–30 minutes in direct sunlight several times a week can naturally boost vitamin D levels, supporting both bone and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your vitamin D levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since standard “one-size-fits-all” dosing may not be effective, regular blood tests are essential. Aim to check your vitamin D levels every three months if you have heart disease or risk factors, so supplementation can be tailored accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalised supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on blood tests, work with your doctor to determine the right vitamin D dose for your body. The goal is to maintain optimal circulating levels, typically above 40 ng/mL, which research shows can significantly reduce the risk of repeat heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplementation complements, but does not replace, standard heart care. Adopt lifestyle measures such as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D helps regulate blood pressure and supports heart muscle function. Pairing optimal vitamin D levels with proper blood pressure and cholesterol management further reduces heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for over-supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin D can lead to adverse effects like hypercalcaemia. Always follow your doctor’s guidance and adjust doses based on regular monitoring rather than taking high doses indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced intake of other nutrients, including calcium and magnesium, can enhance the cardiovascular benefits of vitamin D and support overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay informed and proactive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains a leading cause of death, and vitamin D deficiency is widespread.

							&lt;p&gt;Intelligence shows up in unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of smart people as the ones who aced every test in school or who can solve complex equations in their heads. But intelligence is more nuanced than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology research has found that certain hobbies and activities correlate with higher cognitive abilities. Not because doing these things makes you smarter, but because people with higher IQs are naturally drawn to activities that engage their minds in specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're drawn to several of these hobbies, there's a good chance you're operating at a higher cognitive level than you might realize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reading deeply and widely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few habits stimulate the brain like reading. It improves comprehension, builds empathy, and enhances your ability to make sense of complex information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read often, especially a wide range of material, tend to have better verbal skills and stronger analytical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what matters most is how you read. Immersing yourself in a book — really absorbing the ideas, questioning them, and relating them to your own experiences — activates neural pathways associated with deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/"&gt;reading fiction&lt;/a&gt; strengthens social intelligence because it invites you to step into another person’s mind. Nonfiction, on the other hand, feeds curiosity and improves factual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I get into a reading streak, I notice subtle changes in how I process information. Conversations feel more engaging, and ideas connect faster in my mind. It’s as if reading tunes the brain to a higher frequency of awareness, a mental habit that intelligent people seem to nurture instinctively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Playing musical instruments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and playing music engages your brain in remarkable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're reading notation, coordinating physical movements, listening critically, and making split-second adjustments. All simultaneously. Your brain is processing multiple streams of information and synthesizing them into something coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02023/full"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that musicians have enhanced cognitive abilities, particularly in areas of memory, attention, and pattern recognition. The complexity of musical training creates neural pathways that support higher-level thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up guitar in my twenties and was shocked by how mentally demanding it was. My fingers had to learn movements my brain couldn't consciously control. I had to hear mistakes before I made them. The cognitive load was intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's exactly why musical training correlates with higher IQ. Your brain has to work at multiple levels simultaneously, which strengthens cognitive flexibility and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is one of the most powerful tools for self-understanding. It forces you to organize your thoughts, explore emotions, and translate the abstract into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who write often tend to develop stronger critical thinking and emotional clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists call this “&lt;a href="https://lf.westernsydney.edu.au/engage/theory/metacognition-the-importance-of-thinking-about-ones-thinking"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;,” or thinking about your own thinking. It’s what allows you to evaluate your ideas and see them from multiple angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-IQ individuals are often skilled at this kind of reflection because they’re curious about the “why” behind their thoughts and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Learning new languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever watched someone effortlessly switch between two or three languages? Bilingualism is one of the clearest examples of how the brain can adapt and expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who speak multiple languages show improved memory, better focus, and higher executive function — the brain’s command center for decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning a new language is essentially like weightlifting for your mind. It strengthens your ability to recognize patterns, improves auditory processing, and enhances multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141112084504.htm#:~:text=sounding%20competing%20word.-,What%20is%20this%3F,irrelevant%20words%2C%20the%20researchers%20found."&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have even found that bilingual individuals are better at filtering out irrelevant information, which means their brains can prioritize what truly matters faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the science, language learning opens up new worlds of culture and connection. It invites you to think in different structures, which deepens empathy and creativity. In many ways, it’s the ultimate exercise in perspective-taking, a skill highly correlated with both emotional and intellectual intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Strategy games and puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What draws some people to chess, Go, or even complex video games that require strategy? It’s the mental stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scip.org/news/697089/The-Intelligence-of-Play-Why-Games-and-Puzzles-Make-Us-Smarter-.htm"&gt;Strategy-based hobbies&lt;/a&gt; engage logic, foresight, and adaptability, which are all traits often associated with high intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you play a strategic game, you’re constantly balancing multiple variables, anticipating outcomes, and learning from mistakes. This continuous feedback loop strengthens working memory and reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even simple puzzles like crosswords or Sudoku can have measurable cognitive benefits, especially when done regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I went through a phase where I played chess online every evening after work. It became a kind of mental gym. I could almost feel my brain clicking into a higher gear as I started seeing patterns faster and predicting moves more intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction came less from winning and more from realizing how the mind evolves through practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Coding or building things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something deeply rewarding about creating something from nothing, especially when it involves problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding, building furniture, working on electronics, or even DIY projects activate the brain’s analytical and creative centers at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding, for instance, teaches structured thinking. You learn to break down large problems into smaller, manageable parts — a cognitive process called “&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280068033_Chunking_in_Working_Memory_and_its_Relationship_to_Intelligence"&gt;chunking&lt;/a&gt;” that’s common in highly intelligent thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also improves attention to detail and persistence, since debugging requires patience and logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on projects like building or repairing things develop spatial awareness and fine motor coordination. They also build confidence in applying abstract knowledge to real-world outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent people often gravitate toward these hobbies because they offer tangible proof of learning — a clear link between curiosity, creation, and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If several of these hobbies resonate with you, there's a good chance you're more intelligent than you give yourself credit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence isn't always obvious. It doesn't always show up in traditional academic success or professional achievement. Sometimes it manifests in the activities you're naturally drawn to, the questions you can't stop asking, the way you spend your free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These hobbies indicate a mind that craves complexity, depth, and intellectual stimulation. A mind that processes information in sophisticated ways and finds fulfillment in cognitive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you've ever felt like your interests are weird or your habits are strange, consider this: your brain might just be operating at a level that requires different kinds of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep pursuing what fascinates you. Keep asking difficult questions. Keep learning, creating, and thinking deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not just how you spend your time. That's your intelligence expressing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Among the many diabetes indicators HbA1c remains a crucial one. HbA1c, or glycated hemoglobin, measures the average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. It reflects how well diabetes is managed in the long term. Higher HbA1c risks are linked with complications like nerve damage, heart disease, and kidney issues. Medication and diet are essential, but exercise is one of the most powerful and natural tools to improve glucose control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studies show some physical activities have a stronger and more lasting impact than others in blood sugar control. Here we explore which is the most effective form of exercise for lowering HbA1c, and three of them that stand out are: &lt;strong&gt;​&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. 10-minute walk after every meal&lt;br&gt;2. 40-minute morning walk on an empty stomach&lt;br&gt;3. 30-minute strength training session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here we explore which one of these three exercises is most effective for long term diabetes management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxQa09Kd1JNQlJzLXJ6dE5YSVlZalhHaXMwWkpRb3ltS051eFZtcUVlcnZ6bjlYSEdlNG85LW9HMjQxUHRRV1Z4RW81QWI1THotVUpYdld2MHBIS0pyTk1TTk9qV3pHbTBBbUJGWlhaa2JETXgzeERoU1FBZ2RwcjVUQmFzTU1ubGRFanlHVHVBRkY0b2JVQmFVanRjZ3ZlaG54cjRhdXowNGJxZzc2ZVZPOGUzQkU4eEVRLUFmOHlmSURaT1dxaHFIZUd3QmhpVUl1WHBoc3E2WUppLXRSRkN3bFBPaVQwdV9pTlVqS05xd1RsYXBCRGpZ0gH_AUFVX3lxTFAySlhOMXlDWVhWeVNQbWNIUTlXNmVLOUVobGRqMlVWcW9FWDlMdU9pTGtqNFNLQ013Tk4xVENoSXVxdHpsZmtFMWdaN2x5ZjFfMk92eE9kWHU4LUZrOE5KbVZjZTg5VWZZdXBnaGs2dGt2eERQVjZadzM0UER2cDJfaEYwT3lZaGwwZWIzaS1rMHU4Z2syMWgyUFFjdW9abWMwdGNJRWZlRmtqdEZ0MWg2bWhWS2JNYVNrUnJ5LTJPUTR2UjJEbVd2YzB3NkE3djR2cE1fbk8wZ1N2MmZHQkVWN2I1S3dxN282aDRVM015TXhYRXNaR21JbThfWXdURQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告说，痛苦的疾病将成为这十年的主要威胁： “大量的人类痛苦” -冷静下来</title><link>https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/dengue-fever-climate-change-impacts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;Historically, some diseases have been geographically limited, naturally confined to areas of the globe where the weather is right for their spread. Mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue fever are good examples, because they only proliferate in areas where the temperature and rainfall are beneficial for the mosquito population to grow, as well as for the disease itself to flourish. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, as the Earth heats up due to air pollution, more and more of the world fits those conditions — and dengue fever is already becoming a more widespread problem, as a new study covered by the Stanford Report &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" target="_blank"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Arizona State University, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was published in September in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined how much the Earth's rising temperature will increase cases of dengue fever in the future — and how much it already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-597edcf9dcfb3160f9d8fa085e0399ca theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-597edcf9dcfb3160f9d8fa085e0399ca"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-2fb3891fbdb84d1d17b6a367ebc004a3 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-2fb3891fbdb84d1d17b6a367ebc004a3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7ff90c246587f22f2ef5895572b64b9a theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-7ff90c246587f22f2ef5895572b64b9a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-408aa2b10ad9b663e0ac9c76dd7c1828 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-408aa2b10ad9b663e0ac9c76dd7c1828"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-49ee5c8463299674a082667430a4c4e8 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-49ee5c8463299674a082667430a4c4e8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-363348384b2c3628b3b3a8494046949f theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-363348384b2c3628b3b3a8494046949f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-778b98e9409efeb2a0cb13d62f6b2d24 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-778b98e9409efeb2a0cb13d62f6b2d24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The effects of temperature were much larger than I expected," said lead author Marissa Childs, an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of Washington, per the &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt;. "Even small shifts in temperature can have a big impact for dengue transmission, and we're already seeing the fingerprint of climate warming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-dd0ed9d745840ad7b2c39e9eab4dea69 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-dd0ed9d745840ad7b2c39e9eab4dea69"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So exactly how large was that fingerprint? After examining 1.4 million cases of the disease across 21 countries, researchers determined that climate change is responsible for an additional 4.6 million infections each year, representing an 18% increase in the disease's incidence. By 2050, the rate could climb another 49% to 76%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-729166138" data-theco-trackid="561749" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-this-result-important"&gt;Why is this result important?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-cbb4969a6e582e2c8f7931fe987462fb theco-embedded-video" id="theco-cbb4969a6e582e2c8f7931fe987462fb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue fever, also called "breakbone fever," is a painful and potentially serious illness. In severe cases, it can cause debilitating pain and can lead to death. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, those who contract it more than once are at greater risk of experiencing a severe case. And as the world heats up, more and more people who have never been exposed to this illness before are now at risk — a fact which has already had a death toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"This is not just hypothetical future change but a large amount of human suffering that has already happened because of warming-driven dengue transmission," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author Erin Mordecai, a professor of biology from the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, per the Stanford Report. "Climate change is not just affecting the weather — it has cascading consequences for human health, including fueling disease transmission by mosquitoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-bbdd3e16099684eaf1bdc021e861a9db theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-bbdd3e16099684eaf1bdc021e861a9db"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-about-dengue-fever-transmission"&gt;What's being done about dengue fever transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/dengue-vaccine-nepal-research/" target="_blank"&gt;research into vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; has yielded results that promise to reduce the spread of dengue fever worldwide. Some local governments are also working on directly &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/dengue-virus-california-spread/" target="_blank"&gt;controlling the mosquito population&lt;/a&gt; to thereby stop the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the only long-term solution for the broader problem of diseases that spread more rapidly in warmer temperatures is to reduce the Earth's temperature by reducing air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

No need to fret over finicky homemade hollandaise—our blender method simplifies the process, bypassing the stovetop hassle with a creamy stable sauce that won’t break or separate. Look for medium heads of cauliflower with compact florets for the best “steaks.” The center-cut slices hold their shape best. Use any extra florets from the sides to make cauliflower rice or roast them separately for a salad.

Using AI to analyze natural speech, the study showed that these linguistic features can predict cognitive-test performance independent of age, sex, or education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because speech is effortless to collect and free from practice effects, it offers a scalable way to monitor early brain changes tied to dementia risk. The findings highlight natural speech as a promising tool for early detection and long-term tracking of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech as a Biomarker:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyday timing patterns in speech predict executive function across adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Driven Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine-learning models detected hundreds of subtle linguistic cues linked to cognitive health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Natural speech may enable scalable monitoring for individuals at elevated dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baycrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way we speak in everyday conversation may hold important clues about brain health, according to new research from Baycrest, the University of Toronto and York University.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that subtle features of speech timing, such as pauses, fillers (‘uh,’ ‘um’) and word-finding difficulty, are strongly linked to executive function, the set of mental skills that support memory, planning and flexible thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study is one of the first to demonstrate a direct link between natural speech patterns and essential cognitive functions, opening new avenues of research to better understand the mind. It builds on previous research that showed that faster talking speed is linked to preserved thinking in older adults (Wei et al., 2024). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The message is clear: speech timing is more than just a matter of style, it’s a sensitive indicator of brain health,” says Dr. Jed Meltzer, Senior Scientist at Baycrest’s Rotman Research Institute and senior author on this study, titled “Natural Speech Analysis Can Reveal Individual Differences in Executive Function Across the Adult Lifespan.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to describe complex pictures in their own words while also completing standard tests of executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence, researchers analyzed the recordings and identified hundreds of subtle features, including pauses, filler words and timing patterns. These features reliably predicted performance on cognitive tests, even after accounting for age, sex and education.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive functions decline with age and are often compromised early in dementia, but they are hard to track with traditional testing, which is time-consuming and vulnerable to practice effects, the improvements in performance due to familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural speech, by contrast, is an everyday behaviour that can be measured repeatedly, unobtrusively and at scale. It also provides information about processing speed as a sensitive measure of cognitive integrity in an ecologically valid manner, without the need for imposed time limits — something that is challenging to capture with most traditional cognitive tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the ease, convenience and sensitivity of natural speech analysis, it is an ideal choice for repeated assessments, which could identify individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline at a higher rate than expected and may be at high risk for developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research sets the stage for exciting opportunities to develop tools that could help track cognitive changes in clinics or even at home. Early detection is critical for any cure or intervention, as dementia involves progressive degeneration of the brain that may be slowed,” says Dr. Meltzer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize the need for longitudinal studies, following individuals’ speech over time, to separate normal aging from early signs of disease. They note that combining naturalistic speech with other measures could make early detection of cognitive decline more precise and accessible.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Mitacs Accelerate program and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762900386035"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does natural speech relate to brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Subtle timing features in everyday speech closely track executive function, a core marker of cognitive integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762900387519"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is speech a useful tool for early dementia detection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It can be measured frequently, naturally, and without testing pressures, revealing decline earlier than traditional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762900387391"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did the AI analysis uncover?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Pauses, fillers, and timing patterns reliably predicted performance on executive-function tests across adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this speech and cognitive decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="ilto:nnacevski-laird@baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baycrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird – Baycrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1044/2025_JSLHR-24-00268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natural Speech Analysis Can Reveal Individual Differences in Executive Function Across the Adult Lifespan&lt;/a&gt;” by Jed Meltzer et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Speech Analysis Can Reveal Individual Differences in Executive Function Across the Adult Lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Purpose:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated analysis of naturalistic speech has emerged as an effective tool for detecting cognitive decline in dementia but has seldom been used to examine the ordinary cognitive decline occurring in normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive function (EF) declines throughout the adult lifespan but is difficult to track longitudinally due to practice effects, making speech-based assessments particularly attractive. This study examined relationships between EF and speech characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Method:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collected two audio picture descriptions from participants in two experiments that also included EF assessments, with 67 healthy older adults (aged 65–75 years) in Study 1 and 174 healthy adults (aged 18–90 years) in Study 2. Language composite scores were computed by aggregating relevant speech features indexing aspects of speech that have been reported to show changes in pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal components reflecting common covariation in speech features were extracted from a large training data set to compute speech domain scores. The relationships between language composites/speech principal components and EF were assessed while controlling for age, gender, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Study 1, older adults’ word-finding difficulties, measured as speech disfluencies, showed significant associations with EF. Study 2 confirms that speech disfluencies can explain individual differences in EF not only for adults above the age of 65 years but also across the adult lifespan. Information units and coherence in speech showed weaker associations with EF and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores that were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed associations between word-finding ability in natural speech and general EF across the adult lifespan, supporting natural speech analysis as a convenient and sensitive assessment of general cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 22:37:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5oeVkxOGVUUlhYaE5DUHc0eWtFN3lJYUEyMU5lcU10Y2ZxaUZLeW53Q1UtOGd6WUJna3dmdUVaX2FRaW82TzBETDZkb0RLZHo5di0wQmhQT3UwQm1JdjBHQjh6alZ1SG1McjhTRQ</guid></item><item><title>经常熬夜？根据《科学》-印度时报，这就是为什么您在年轻时有心脏病发作的风险</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/staying-up-late-often-heres-why-you-are-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack-at-a-young-age-according-to-science/articleshow/125247717.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often stay up late in the night-on weekends, vacations, or just watching a movie or partying. While occasionally pulling off an all-nighter is not a matter of much concern, staying late everyday as a habit, may be a serious threat to heart health. Habitually keeping the lights on bedtime and tossing your body’s natural rhythms off‑balance, appears to raise the odds of suffering a heart attack at a younger age, says science. Let’s see how…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disrupted circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies operate on a 24‑hour cycle-the rhythm, that governs sleep hormone release, body temperature, and a host of other vital functions. When you stay awake late at night, this rhythm gets thrown off balance. Studies show that such disruption raises the risk of diseases, including heart disease (CHD) and heart attacks. Regular late‑night activities can also interfere with the release of protective hormones, that keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Night shift employees at risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who pull the dreaded night shift, seem to carry an extra burden when it comes to heart health. A Harvard Medical School &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/night-shift-risks" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that women who have spent more than a decade on rotating night schedules, face a 15‑18 % higher likelihood of developing coronary heart disease than their counterparts, who work regular daytime hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger climbs higher the longer the exposure, or more erratic the schedule is. Working nights disrupts blood pressure, cholesterol and a host of markers, nudging the odds of a heart attack upward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Silent harm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying up often results in less, or low‑quality sleep, both of which weigh heavily on heart health. A deficit of sleep drives up blood pressure, fuels inflammation and elevates hormones, each of which can erode blood vessels and the heart over time. Individuals who get more than seven hours of sleep a night, or who maintain consistent sleep patterns-face a markedly higher risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. Scientific research confirms that a chronic lack of sleep hastens the aging of the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Hormonal imbalance and blood clot formation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working nights or staying up late, throws the body’s hormone balance off, especially the production of cortisol and melatonin. When cortisol stays elevated, it tends to push both blood pressure and blood‑sugar levels, two well‑known risk factors, for heart attacks. Moreover, inadequate sleep and a disrupted circadian rhythm, make the blood more prone to clotting, raising the odds that a coronary artery will become blocked, and precipitate a heart attack. Over time, these hormonal shifts linked to night‑time work, can set the stage for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How working nights shape lifestyle habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night‑shift employees often fall into a host of dangerous habits- poor eating choices, scant exercise, smoking, or gulping down caffeine, just to stay awake. Each of those behaviors nudges the heart toward risk. Research shows that people who work nights, are more likely to be obese, and develop metabolic syndrome, both of which are predictors of heart attacks. Yet, addressing and reversing these lifestyle factors is essential even though it is frequently overlooked, when the focus remains on the effects of staying up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Early heart attacks-strategies to stop them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realise that pulling late‑nights, or after‑hours shifts can actually trigger heart attacks at an early age, sometimes as early, as 30s or 40s. To keep risks at bay, the basics are surprisingly simple: prioritise sleep hygiene, keep stress under control, and adopt a healthier way of living. A growing number of firms are now experimenting with flexible scheduling, and even redesigning workspaces to be more conducive to proper rest, all in an effort to lower those risks. This apart, regular check‑ups that monitor blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar are indispensable for catching early issues, and preventing them from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Scientific evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several investigations back up the notion that burning the midnight oil, or working night shifts, pushes heart‑attack risk upward. For example, a paper in the Journal of the American Heart Association, reported that women who logged more than a decade of night‑shift work, faced a 15‑18 % chance of heart disease. Likewise, a study in the European Heart Journal found that erratic sleep patterns paired with night‑tim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;e work, roughly doubled the odds of developing heart disease over years. These results underscore that staying up late isn’t just a source of stress-it can also lead to lasting damage, to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Putting everything together&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying up late might feel like a harmless habit, however, research shows it can seriously jeopardise heart health. When the circadian rhythm is disrupted, hormones get out of balance, sleep quality drops, and unhealthy habits pile up-all of which push the risk of a heart attack. The upside is that modest tweaks, like nudging bedtime, reshuffling work hours and adopting daily routines, can slash that danger dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAJBVV95cUxONk9OLVo3UUNna01qT19GZS1ObmJLd2hmS1ROQTRFeXkwZFRyd3FBeVA5RFMwTFFJNVlyaHN5NnBKaFdyYnBsZzBILVhmT19BcUNENGFiLW1UbWUxWlVaTzhWcUFRdko5TFVZNk1aZ3o5WF9jeV9MbC1aWnZDVGFNdkhhaUJCUGZLQTZjWl9IZFozQmF4SkJZam9vOXJnTWd0blhBcnAzVTVueDg4d2VmSTFtcUJ2NkltcDhFeG5pSlNzSGJwYV9CUnhoQ0JwZUw5X0J3RVNGUTNNV05XaHljM2NQcU80RG1nOTRTeHZUYUc3bENqVnpoMGVxSVJfS2Fua2YyQ0djSk1FcFBxSjZsaDFyZktySUow</guid></item><item><title>越来越多的人在65岁之前死亡-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/11/nation/more-people-are-dying-before-they-turn-65/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

People are also confronting the rising cost of living and scrambling to secure health insurance, which is often tied to a job with benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We work ourselves to death,” LaVeist said. “We live in a very stressful society, and the stress has become normative because everyone’s living under” it. Though he noted that the stress is not distributed evenly throughout the society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Black and low-wage workers disproportionately have jobs that don’t provide health insurance, so they’re either covered by Medicaid, Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, or they go without, said Avenel Joseph, vice president of policy at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health policy experts say the consequences of dying early ripple across generations, causing a loss of productivity not just from the deceased individual but from family members who provide care and support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Typically, people are “not just dropping dead,” Joseph said. “Presumably, these people are sick.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Chronic diseases kill far more people aged 35 to 64 than drugs and guns, The Post previously reported. In fact, chronic diseases erase more than twice as many years of life among people younger than 65 as all the overdoses, homicides, suicides, and car accidents combined, The Post found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And that means more doctor visits, more medications, more hospitalizations, and less time working, volunteering, and learning at a time when people are supposed to be in the prime of life, public health experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You have a period of economic hardship for those families who are caring for those middle-aged adults, frankly, before their death,” Joseph said. “And then they are not having the compensation or the passage of wealth that happens as a result of Social Security benefits, your retirement benefits, pensions, and other things.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dying before being able to utilize the benefit system that people have been paying into breaks the social contract, Joseph said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 21:29:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQcVBhZWNINTU0ZkJZWFczWWdxcmFUMW1fNnY0eEF4VnlYWmUzenVIN2ZtR250emdDaU4tX1hzSGtEU0ttNllJMDJJanlRSjhKU1lQSm52SjJHdVZvUHVkSDlOX2ZubWpuZVQ3TVU5TE1pMTQwN3dqSUlRYWhHMkhqMnFmQ0VJU2dQZjltR1FyaWZZdw</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了精神和神经系统疾病的共同遗传根源- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-reveals-genetic-roots-psychiatric-neurological.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Center for Precision Psychiatry at the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital have discovered extensive genetic links between neurological disorders like migraine, stroke and epilepsy, and psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02090-2" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; challenges longstanding boundaries between neurology and psychiatry and points to the need for more integrated approaches to brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We found that psychiatric and neurological disorders share &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk factors&lt;/a&gt; to a greater extent than previously recognized. This suggests that they may partly arise from the same underlying biology, contrasting the traditional view that they are separate disease entities. Importantly, the genetic risk was closely linked to brain biology," states Olav Bjerkehagen Smeland, psychiatrist and first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nearly 1 million cases analyzed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic data&lt;/a&gt; from close to 1 million individuals with a wide range of psychiatric or neurological conditions. This &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/large+dataset/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;large dataset&lt;/a&gt; made it possible to map both shared and disorder-specific genetic signals. "The findings are consistent with what we see clinically: patients often present with overlapping symptoms across neurology and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;," says Professor Ole Andreassen, leader of the Center for Precision Psychiatry. "Our results support a more unified view of neurological and psychiatric disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Smeland, the study suggests that patients could benefit from treatment strategies that take both biological and mental aspects into account. "We should ask whether patients receive the best care when neurology and psychiatry operate in parallel rather than together," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the study found substantial genetic overlap, the disorders still displayed partly distinct biological signatures. "For instance, genetic susceptibility to stroke was associated with risk factors for thrombosis, while epilepsy was connected to neurons—the brain's nerve cells. The genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, by contrast, was tied to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, which also influences the nervous system. The genetic risk for psychiatric illnesses was consistently linked to neurons. This tells us that neurological and psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous, but may still be connected within a common biological framework," Smeland explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While distinctions between neurological and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; do exist, this study paves the way for a more holistic understanding of brain disorders. "I believe that improved knowledge exchange and closer collaboration between psychiatry and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neurology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt; could substantially benefit patients, " Smeland states.&lt;/p&gt;

Removing these stress-vulnerable cells caused major drops in vessel oscillations and widespread reductions in electrical signaling, suggesting a crucial link between neuron loss, blood-flow decline, and brain-function impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these neurons die easily under stress, chronic psychological strain may contribute to brain-health decline beyond aging alone. The findings open new directions for investigating how environmental stressors and neurodegenerative risk intersect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress-Sensitive Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Type-one nNOS neurons die readily under chronic stress and regulate key blood-flow dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System-Wide Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Their removal reduces vessel oscillations and weakens brain-wide neural activity, especially during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Risk Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress may damage a neuron type essential for brain perfusion, offering a fresh angle on dementia mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Penn State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the exact causes of neurodegenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia are still largely unknown, researchers have been able to identify a key characteristic in affected brains: reduced blood flow. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building upon this foundational understanding, a team at Penn State recently found that a rare neuron that is extremely vulnerable to anxiety-induced stress appears to be responsible for regulating blood flow and coordinating neural activity in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that eliminating type-one nNOS neurons — which make up less than 1% of the brain’s 80 billion neurons and die off when exposed to too much stress — resulted in a drop in both blood flow and electrical activity in mice brains, demonstrating the impact this neuron type has on the proper brain functions of animals, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They published their research today (Nov. 11) in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick&lt;a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/patrick-drew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Drew&lt;/a&gt;, professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State and principal investigator on the project, explained that although more than 20 different varieties of neurons make up any section of the brain, type-one nNOS neurons in the somatosensory cortex — the region that processes touch, temperature and other sensory input from the body — play a critical role in stimulating the “spontaneous oscillation” of arteries and veins in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In your brain, arteries, veins and capillaries help move fluid around by constantly dilating and constricting every few seconds, which we call spontaneous oscillation,” Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous work from our lab has shown that nNOS neurons are important for regulating blood flow in the brain. After targeting and eliminating a subset of these neurons, we observed a significant reduction in the amplitude of these oscillations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Drew, who also holds affiliations with the biomedical engineering, neurosurgery and biology departments at Penn State, when mice are exposed to mentally stressful experiences, these delicate neurons can easily die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other researchers have previously connected aging with reduced brain performance and increased risk to neurodegenerative diseases, Drew said there is much less research on stress and the negative impacts it can have on blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are broadly interested in how blood flow is regulated in the brain, as it supplies nutrients and oxygen to neurons,” Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reduced blood flow is one of many contributing factors to reduced brain function and neurodegenerative diseases. While we know aging plays a major role in this, losing these rare neurons to chronic stress could be an unexplored environmental cause for poor brain health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what happens without type-one nNOS neurons in the brain, the team injected mice with a mix of saporin — a toxic protein capable of killing neurons — and a chemical chain of amino acids known as a peptide, which can identify and latch onto specific genetic markers emitted by type-one nNOS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers differentiate type-one nNOS neurons in the brain, allowing the researchers to systematically deliver saporin and eliminate them without harming other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Penn State is the first to use this method to target these specific neurons, according to Drew. While a mouse brain isn’t a perfect model for the human brain, much of the physiology — including neuronal type and composition — match, Drew said, so this type of work can reveal information that likely maps to humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After injecting the mice, the researchers recorded changes in brain activity and physical behaviors like eye dilation and whisker movement. The team observed cerebral blood vessel oscillations at micrometer-level resolution — roughly 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair, according to Drew. The researchers also used electrodes and advanced imaging to track electrical currents in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice showed not just reduced blood flow, but weaker neural activity across the brain, indicating that these type-one nNOS neurons seem to be important in helping neurons communicate with one another, Drew explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team identified these reductions in blood flow and neural activity were higher during sleep than in the awake state, indicating these neurons could play a role in supporting the brain during sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Drew, optimizing this procedure will provide an efficient and non-genetic way for researchers to study type-one nNOS neurons and the impacts of losing them in further detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is too early to draw a direct connection between reduced density of these neurons with increased risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia, Drew said the future of this research will focus on investigating how the loss of these neurons interacts with genetic risk factors for the diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Penn State-affiliated authors on the project include Nicole Crowley, associate professor of biology; Kevin Turner, who obtained his doctorate in bioengineering and biomedical engineering at Penn State; Dakota Brockway, who obtained his doctorate in neuroscience from Penn State; Kyle Gheres, who obtained his doctorate in molecular cellular and integrative biosciences from Penn State; Md Shakhawat Hossain, a biomedical engineering doctoral student; Keith Griffith, a doctoral student in the College of Medicine; and Denver Greenawalt, a molecular, cellular and integrated biosciences doctoral student.

The move, which the FDA called “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-advances-womens-health-removes-misleading-fda-warnings-hormone-replacement-therapy.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-advances-womens-health-removes-misleading-fda-warnings-hormone-replacement-therapy.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a historic action&lt;/a&gt; to restore gold-standard science to women’s health”, is drawing both praise and concern from scientists and advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many argue that the warnings, which have appeared on the products for more than 20 years, have contributed to chronic underuse of menopausal hormone therapy among women who were likely to benefit. Yet some now worry that removing the labels entirely, or making overly broad claims about hormones, health and longevity, might swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. “I’m afraid comprehensive discussion about the risks and benefits may not occur in absence of that warning,” says Stephanie Faubion, the director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida, and medical director of The Menopause Society a non-profit organization based in Pepper Pike, Ohio, that provides tools and resources to health-care professionals. “We need to end up somewhere in the middle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hormone crash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy was widely prescribed for decades to ease common menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and poor sleep. But prescriptions plunged worldwide in 2002 after an initial report from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) — a long-term US study — suggested that postmenopausal participants who were taking oestrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) had slightly increased risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings — &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00069-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00069-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;widely misinterpreted and overgeneralized&lt;/a&gt; — sparked fear among women and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2003, the FDA announced that oestrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy products would require a ‘black box’ safety warning, the agency’s strongest. Regulatory agencies around the world followed the FDA’s lead by changing labels and issuing advisories. Use of these products remained low even though later research hinted at reduced risks of heart disease and death among hormone-therapy users, and lower rates of breast cancer among those taking oestrogen-only therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01474-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03687-0/d41586-025-03687-0_25312650.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How menopause reshapes the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;A 2024 review reiterated that the hormone formulations, doses and delivery routes used in the WHI trials differed from those typically used today&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Transdermal patches don’t show the same links to blood clots found with oral hormones, for example. And using lower doses and hormones that are identical to those found in the body might further limit risks. Researchers have also noted that most participants included in the initial, concerning WHI analysis were a decade or more beyond menopause, a stage when the sudden return of oestrogen might pose health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the WHI results were reported, about one-quarter of women over the age of 40 used systemic hormone therapy. Now, that figure is about 1.7%, according to The Menopause Society. “I don’t know what percentage should be getting the therapy, but I’d venture to say it is probably more than 1.7%,” says Faubion. “On the other hand, I don’t think we should go back to thinking this is the be-all-end-all longevity drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance of risks and benefits depends on a person’s age, years elapsed since menopause, whether the individual has a uterus, existing medical conditions and the therapy’s formulation, route of delivery and dose. “Hormone therapy is not for everyone,” says JoAnn Manson, a women’s health researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a former president of The Menopause Society. Generally, she says, women under the age of 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause who are experiencing symptoms might be good candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manson says she doesn’t think that the message needs to appear in a “frightening black box”. But she says the package inserts should summarize clinical-trial data so that women, together with their clinicians, can make informed and personalized decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Its roots can stretch back a decade or more, silently altering the brain. Many people dismiss subtle changes in memory, mood, or daily functioning as normal aging. However, a landmark study found that lower cognitive test scores predict the development of Alzheimer’s disease 13 to 17 years before diagnosis. Recognizing early signs can be life-changing, offering opportunities for early intervention, lifestyle adjustments, and proactive planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a general term for a group of brain disorders that cause a gradual decline in memory, thinking, reasoning, and the ability to perform everyday activities.

			&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep could forestall the declines in brain health that can eventually lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="180965" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study of 62 older, cognitively healthy adults, researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley, Stanford University, and UC Irvine in the US found individuals with brain changes associated with Alzheimer's performed better on memory function tests as they got more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was irrespective of education and physical activity, two factors along with social connection known to contribute to cognitive resilience in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-hijack-your-cells-clocks-hinting-at-new-treatments"&gt;Alzheimer's May Hijack Your Cells' Clocks, Hinting at New Treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with similar Alzheimer's-linked changes who failed to get as much deep sleep didn't fare quite as well on the same tests. &lt;span&gt;By comparison, sleep made little difference to those individuals with few deposits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results, which were published in May 2023, imply having a generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the following video for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory getting dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer's disease pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of California (UC) Berkeley neuroscientist Matthew Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is especially exciting because we can do something about it.

Likewise, clumpy amyloid-beta proteins might only be a sign of Alzheimer's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;not its root cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-compound-in-rosemary-could-help-fight-alzheimers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Hidden Compound in Rosemary Could Help Fight Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, levels of amyloid-beta proteins are commonly used as a marker of Alzheimer's disease, as research suggests they – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-find-biological-changes-visible-up-to-30-years-before-alzheimer-s-symptoms-appear"&gt;another protein called tau&lt;/a&gt; – can start clogging up brain cells decades before symptoms of the disease arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research from Walker's group found significant levels of amyloid-beta aggregating in the brains of older adults can disrupt deep sleep – also known as non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep – and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4035"&gt;impair memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some folk appear to stave off the decline that comes with Alzheimer's disease, even when levels of amyloid-beta proteins are relatively high. To find out why, Walker and colleagues monitored participants' brain waves as they slept, and then asked them to complete a memory test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those whose brain scans revealed similarly high levels of beta-amyloid deposits, getting a good night's sleep seemed to make a critical difference in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect was only seen when the researchers looked specifically at non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep, and not at other sleep wave frequencies or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg" alt="Illustration of Brains " class="size-full wp-image-143046" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-434x415.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-600x574.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In people with similar amounts of beta-amyloid protein deposits, more deep sleep corresponded with improved memory function.

It also points to sleep quality being important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a certain level of brain pathology, you're not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UC Berkeley neuroscientist and lead author Zsófia Zavecz &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the study findings in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people may display molecular changes indicating a progression toward Alzheimer's disease, Zavecz says their findings suggest lifestyle factors can help buffer against those effects. "One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep," she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, though small, also hints at why getting good sleep naturally might be a better option than taking sleeping pills to get some shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research shows users of sleeping pills &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sleeping-pill-may-reduce-the-build-up-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;appear to have lower levels of amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; in their cerebrospinal fluid, which washes the brain clean at night. But these medications come with side effects; they may also lull people into shallow bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, to set yourself up for a good night's sleep, Zavecz suggests cutting out  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="180965" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; late in the day, doing some exercise, avoiding screen time, and taking a hot shower before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you snooze, rest assured scientists are working hard to figure out the knotty problems of Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in May 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
