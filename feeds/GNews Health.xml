The birds in Central Park, the kids laughing in the spray of water from open fire hydrants, the $20 sandwich you got at the good deli to eat on a picnic blanket along the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also hotter than the inside of a dog’s mouth. I don’t want to be dramatic, but I believe that moving about an ever-warming subtropical New York City in the summer without the promise of a Hamptons escape on the weekends is the making for a Les Mis Part Deux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I walk to work, sweat lining my upper lip and a triangle of space above my eyebrows, I think to myself, well, it could be worse. I could be having a panic attack, which, before medicine, was a common occurrence for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then it hits - the very thing helping me keep my sanity in a crowded subway car is also the thing making me feel like I've been trapped in sauna fully clothed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For about a decade, I've taken an SSRI - a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor - to help with my anxiety and depressive episodes. Medications in this class include Zoloft and Prozac and among the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12226335/Heatwave-health-warning-millions-antidepressants-little-known-agonising-effect.html"&gt;laundry list of side effects&lt;/a&gt;, which include gastrointestinal issues, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-5352377/Rare-condition-leaves-woman-uncontrollably-SWEATING.html"&gt;is hyperhidrosis&lt;/a&gt; – or excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the roughly 32 million Americans take an antidepressant, around 21 percent - 6.7 million people - experience this less-than-ideal side effect, according to the International Hyperhidrosis Society. The excessive dampness occurs because SSRIs disrupt the body's internal temperature gauge, triggering excessive - and sometimes unnecessary - sweating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Angela Downey, a family physician and host of the Codependent Doctor Podcast, told me that these medications impact the hypothalamus, also known as the brain’s thermostat, ‘which affects how your body regulates your body temperature and sweat production.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘Think of serotonin like an orchestra conductor who has suddenly turned up the volume on your internal HVAC system. It will sometimes overcorrect and can lead to unexpected sweating, especially at night or in warm weather.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Me in the sweltering New York City summer featuring my trusty battery-powered fan that I take on the subway (and everywhere else)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What a trade-off. I don’t have crippling panic attacks or a dark cloud of gloom hanging over me, but after 10 minutes of walking down 8th Avenue, I look like I just crawled out of the East River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis is a relatively common side effect of SSRIs and another class of drugs similar to SSRIs that I've also taken called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include Effexor and Cymbalta, according to Dr Olalekan Otulana, a general practitioner and addiction medicine specialist in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SSRIs allow serotonin - the 'happy hormone' to remain available in the brain’s synapses for longer before being reabsorbed, leaving more of the feel-good neurochemical around to improve mood and alleviate anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine - a hormone that regulates the intensity of some emotions - increasing levels of both neurotransmitters to improve mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told me that these drugs stimulate the body’s temperature regulation center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This ‘can lead to the body perceiving that it is warmer than it is, triggering the sweat glands to produce more perspiration as a cooling response.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat, and the serotonin molecules there contain receptors that, when stimulated by an SNRI or an SSRI, can lower body temperature by promoting heat loss, including sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows antidepressant use in women, men, and both sexes together over the past 30 days in the US from 2009 to 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SSRIs flood the brain with serotonin, disrupting the hypothalamus’s ability to interpret temperature cues. It takes the influx of serotonin as a signal to start sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when you add norepinephrine in SNRIs to the mix, the hypothalamus gets a double hit of dysregulation and a direct impact on sweat glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ashwini Nadkarni, a board-certified psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, told me: ‘To deal with this, people can discuss options with their treating physician,’ including switching to an antidepressant less likely to cause sweating, such as Vortioxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Non-pharmacological strategies include wearing loose attire with breathable fabrics, keeping cool with a fan, and staying hydrated during the day,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I have tried several different SSRIs and SNRIs in my long career in mental illness, and was never warned about hyperhidrosis. Psychiatrists were quick to warn a high-school-age me &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13448013/fda-sued-antidepressants-ssri-sexual-effects.html"&gt;about low libido&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Otulana added: ‘People often notice this side effect more in the summer as their baseline sweating due to heat is already higher. And the drug effect amplifies this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For some, it can be quite distressing, especially if it affects confidence at work or in social situations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, few things irk me more than spending a pretty penny on high-quality makeup products only for them to slowly shift and melt on my face, so that by the time I enter work, I resemble a Picasso drawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Of the roughly 32 million Americans take an antidepressant like Zoloft (pictured), around 21 percent - 6.7 million people - experience this less-than-ideal side effect (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Darji added: ‘I always tell patients this is a real side effect and not something they’re imagining. It can impact their quality of life or make them want to stop their medication, which is why we take it seriously.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you find the sweating to be unbearable, don't stop taking your medicine without the guidance of your doctor, who will begin tapering your dose safely to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Make sure you speak to your doctor about it. We can adjust the dose, switch to a different medication, or add a small dose of another medication to help manage the sweating,’ Dr Uma Darji, a board-certified family medicine physician, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For millions of people, a sweaty summer (and fall, winter, and spring) is a small price to pay for emotional stability, or at least some semblance of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that participants who ate eggs weekly had a lower rate of clinical diagnosis and fewer Alzheimer’s-related brain changes after death. The study also identified dietary choline, a key nutrient found in eggs, as one possible contributor to this protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death among older adults. It is marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and changes in behavior, and is associated with biological features in the brain such as the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people currently living with the disease in the United States, researchers have been searching for ways to reduce the risk or delay its onset. Diet has been one area of focus, especially nutrients that support brain health. Eggs are a natural source of several such nutrients, including choline, omega-3 fatty acids, and lutein. Prior studies suggested that egg intake may support cognitive performance, but few have examined its relationship to Alzheimer’s disease directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, the researchers analyzed data from 1,024 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a long-running study of older adults in the Chicago area. All participants were free of dementia at the time they completed a detailed dietary questionnaire. The survey, adapted from a well-known food frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard, asked about their typical diet over the previous year, including how often they ate eggs. Participants were then followed for an average of nearly seven years, during which they underwent yearly assessments for signs of Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to clinical evaluations, a subset of 578 participants donated their brains for research after death. These samples allowed the researchers to examine the biological features associated with Alzheimer’s disease and assess whether egg intake was related to the presence of those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team categorized participants into groups based on how often they consumed eggs: less than once per month, one to three times per month, once per week, and two or more times per week. They then used statistical models to compare the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s dementia across these groups. The models took into account a wide range of other factors, including age, education, physical activity, genetics, and overall diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people who ate eggs at least once a week had a lower rate of clinical Alzheimer’s diagnosis than those who ate them rarely. Specifically, both the once-a-week and two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month. These results remained statistically significant even after adjusting for a variety of potential confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain autopsy data supported the clinical findings. Among deceased participants, those who had eaten eggs more than once a week were less likely to show the brain pathology typical of Alzheimer’s disease, including plaques and tangles. Again, the association remained significant after accounting for other variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore why egg consumption might be linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk, the researchers examined dietary choline intake as a potential mediator. Choline is a nutrient essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning. It also contributes to the structure of cell membranes in the brain. Eggs are the top dietary source of choline in the U.S. diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analysis showed that nearly 40 percent of the association between egg consumption and reduced Alzheimer’s risk could be explained by choline intake. In other words, choline appeared to play a meaningful role in the protective effect observed. Participants who ate eggs more frequently also had significantly higher average choline intake over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides evidence that frequent egg consumption is linked not only to better cognitive outcomes, but also to less underlying brain pathology. The findings support the idea that dietary choices in later life can influence brain aging, and highlight eggs as a potentially beneficial food for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers caution that the study does not prove that eggs prevent Alzheimer’s disease. The study was observational, meaning it cannot establish cause and effect. There is also the possibility of reverse causation, since some people may change their diet in subtle ways as cognitive decline begins. The dietary questionnaire was only administered once, and it relied on self-reported data, which may introduce recall bias or inaccuracies. Additionally, the food frequency questionnaire only asked about whole egg consumption, not about eggs used as ingredients in other foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study population was predominantly female, highly educated, and over the age of 80, which may limit how broadly the results apply. The relatively short follow-up period of under seven years also means the study could have missed longer-term effects. Despite these caveats, the study’s strengths include its large sample, long-running cohort, and access to detailed clinical and postmortem data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the National Institutes of Health and the Egg Nutrition Center, among other sources. Several of the authors disclosed financial relationships with food and nutrition organizations, including the egg industry, though the funding sources did not influence the analysis or interpretation of the results. The researchers adhered to transparency guidelines for nutrition research involving private sector funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the authors suggest that additional studies should replicate these findings in other populations, and that randomized controlled trials could help clarify whether egg consumption directly influences Alzheimer’s risk. If the link is confirmed, eggs could become part of broader dietary recommendations aimed at promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.012" target="_blank"&gt;Association of Egg Intake With Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk in Older Adults: The Rush Memory and Aging Project&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yongyi Pan, Taylor C.

Further details including the identify of the victim were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a bacterial infection known for killing tens of millions in 14th century Europe. Today, it's easily treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21590-bubonic-plague" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt; is the most common form of the bacterial infection, which spreads naturally among rodents like prairie dogs and rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague that spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague that infects the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread. The bacteria is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas that can spread it between rodents, pets and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also get plague through touching infected bodily fluids. Health experts recommend taking extra care when handling dead or sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases happen in rural areas of northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 19:52:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNMFpTYVlSd0hSc1FZUjZRN2x0Vl9WQTJ2dkRzN2lkM3hGNVBOVExoQlpvVVE4RVR6V3h4N2dpRXhjeVpoUlJWeFpfc0lLLXRjSzN5RG1NRXczaWp0Sm5CY3g1LWdBQ18yVDdudmZlNXVqYmt0ODVmYmpjUGQyc29xZkZkcU1RQQ</guid></item><item><title>官员称亚利桑那州居民死于瘟疫-《纽约时报》 | Arizona Resident Dies From Plague, Officials Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5PaHFrTzFaZnVBc3l6VnJvR2lrVm9nTFVwRlQ5ME83V2NfT0RTTjJhd1JUWjBoSTM4MzN5cWZNOHp4bkhoZ0tEdndNbk1Mdi1mTXFsdVpPMmJmY0Y5WUJNYjR0WkYycDZYT3JRN1B2NlNXODB0NnFTMXdLNGliUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 17:48:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5PaHFrTzFaZnVBc3l6VnJvR2lrVm9nTFVwRlQ5ME83V2NfT0RTTjJhd1JUWjBoSTM4MzN5cWZNOHp4bkhoZ0tEdndNbk1Mdi1mTXFsdVpPMmJmY0Y5WUJNYjR0WkYycDZYT3JRN1B2NlNXODB0NnFTMXdLNGliUQ</guid></item><item><title>走自己的路，降低血压，强健腿部和更健康的心脏- Ynetnews | Walk your way to lower blood pressure, stronger legs and fitter heart - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTE1TZlcweGVyRnpSdHlKQ1cxdUlQM19HZWxOQ05rVjB4UnZUNXJTdDF6eENlZzFaOXRLYUdlOXhlbUF1dkw3LUlBRVpxOS1UaHB6UEZnYThNLXV0Z0FJSzNMMg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Walk your way to lower blood pressure, stronger legs and fitter heart&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;No gym, no gear—just sneakers, a stopwatch and 30 minutes; 'Japanese Walking,' a simple interval method from Japan, is now going global for one reason: it works; burn calories, build strength, and boost heart health—all without breaking a sweat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:40:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTE1TZlcweGVyRnpSdHlKQ1cxdUlQM19HZWxOQ05rVjB4UnZUNXJTdDF6eENlZzFaOXRLYUdlOXhlbUF1dkw3LUlBRVpxOS1UaHB6UEZnYThNLXV0Z0FJSzNMMg</guid></item><item><title>疫苗：为什么它们比您想象的更重要- Salon.com | Vaccines: Why they're even more important than you think - Salon.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOdk5ZdTdmbUVHRTY5OEJEeXQ0X1p4anJmX3RJc3RYM3Z4dHFJcjA1MFBtOFpLbWpSdmoyTFI4cUR0ZkRSRnpDMnRUSVRIUWttaWQ3bEFMYk9jUkh2T2lPZEpxeXNDdWFtZk1QZ0JwbWNodlRrZGVJeDFpVUU0MnkxNWRfN3l3aUFndmJ4VHN6cmpPejB5aDJGcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="article__content page-article"&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Vaccines work, actually. But that’s not all. Depending on the specific vaccine we’re talking about, that jab might also prevent cancer, heal herpes lesions, help you keep most of your marbles, prevent your kids from dying in early childhood, improve your skin and so much more. These surprising bonuses that can come with vaccination, called beneficial non-specific effects, are common, but not widely understood. In fact, no one knew about them until relatively recently — and when researchers first discovered all this, no one believed them at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we look at that, let’s consider just how good these non-specific effects can get. Well, the Shingrix (or Zoster vaccine recombinant) vaccine, which is recommended for all adults in later middle age, prevents up to 95 percent of shingles cases. But that’s not all. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;It also reduces your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, with a 20 percent relative risk reduction over seven years. (Shingles is the long-term result of a childhood chicken pox infection, which can hide inside you for decades before re-emerging in notoriously painful fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Martin, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told Salon in a video interview that certain viruses, like the herpes group — which includes the chicken pox virus and the one that causes cold sores, as well as genital herpes — “are notorious for these reactivation and latency patterns, and  changing your health status over the long term based on how much they’re around and active in your body.” It seems that the Shingrix vaccine’s remarkable effect on rates of dementia in older adults is the result of preventing some of those health status changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the shingles vaccine does is it dampens reactivations of latent viruses in a way that may be protecting other parts of your body,” Martin said. Including, it seems, the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine protects children against those three diseases, of course. (Two doses are 97 percent effective against measles, for example). But that’s not all. It also reduces &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37482223/"&gt;your child’s all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt; — that is, their risk of dying of any cause, for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral polio vaccine prevents — surprise! — polio. But that’s not all. Vaccinating a newborn baby within its first two days &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614411/"&gt;reduces their risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; in their first year by 10 to 62 percent, while also reducing the risk of flu, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35711442/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9196174/"&gt;bacterial diarrhea and otitis media, among other infections&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines currently in development for Staphylococcus aureus infections, including MRSA, might have the side effect of &lt;a href="https://thesecretlifeofskin.com/2023/10/12/vaccines-skin-microbiome-and-skin-diseases/"&gt;fighting atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and impetigo — maybe even acne.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from public health officials about how we should get vaccines because it’s good for us, like flossing our teeth. In the U.S., rather obviously, the public health message has gotten more confused of late. We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. So why isn’t anyone telling us about these remarkable side effects of vaccination? If you were trying to sell a product that not only keeps you healthy when other people are getting sick with, say, chicken pox, but also prevents you from getting a painful and potentially damaging disease many years later, wouldn’t you want to advertise that? Because that thing would sell like gangbusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. Why isn’t anyone telling us about the remarkable side effects of vaccination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the numbers don’t lie. Mind you, this is science we’re talking about, and there’s an important distinction between noticing an association and confirming a causal connection. So what’s the cause? By what mechanism do vaccines do so much unexpected good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are “basically two ways” of understanding these “off-target effects,” Martin said. “One way of looking at it is that the disease the vaccine is preventing is actually causing a wider range of illnesses and issues than we ever realized before we started vaccinating.” she explained. Influenza, which can cause falls and cognitive status issues in older people during acute infection and recovery, offers a classic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then, if you look at something like measles,” Martin continued, “those other effects are giant.” Measles is distinctive in that it essentially goes into a person’s system and wipes out the T-cells — a vital part of the immune response — gained during previous infections of other kinds. “Any of the lived experience that you’ve had to build up antibodies against infection then gets wiped out by the measles virus. When you recover from a live measles infection … you’ve just lost all of your immunity. It’ll be like you’re a kid in day care for the first time. So you’re going to be encountering all of these diseases with very little prior immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the beneficial non-specific effect of measles vaccination, then, derives from preventing a disease whose &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/"&gt;health impacts are more serious and long-term&lt;/a&gt; than scientists originally understood. But there’s a further effect, believed to relate to another phenomenon called trained immunity. That’s what happens when activating an organism’s innate or built-in immunity can result in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7186935/"&gt;later revved-up response to a new immune challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases. Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist, discovered the beneficial non-specific effects of vaccines while working in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau after it gained independence in the 1970s. As in many other poor countries, Guinea-Bissau’s extremely high child mortality, which meant more than half of all children died before age 5, was attributed by mostly Western scientists and policymakers to malnutrition. But when Aaby’s team conducted a survey of 1,200 children, they found that malnourishment was virtually nonexistent. Just after that survey was completed, a severe measles epidemic swept the area, killing one-fourth of all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So malnutrition no longer made sense as the “explanation of severe child mortality,” Aaby told Salon in a video interview. “The stunning thing was, there was no relationship. The nutritional status of the children who died of measles was not different from those who survived.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he had a hard time getting the Swedish research organization that had hired him, or other medical authorities who reviewed his work, to address the implications of the data. He eventually tested a new hypothesis: It wasn’t nutritional status that determined how bad a case of measles was, but rather how intensely a child had been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those most likely to die, Aaby found, were “the children who are infected inside the home.” When many children lived under the same roof, he explained, they were likely to be exposed to far greater doses of the virus. “That turned out to be by far the strongest explanation of measles mortality,” he said. “I have also subsequently shown that the same pattern applies not just to measles, but [also] for chicken pox, RSV, polio and whooping cough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby’s team then went door to door providing measles vaccinations, and a few years later he received a follow-up report, describing what happened to children who had been involved in the study and subsequent ones carried out in rural areas. “I got the idea that maybe measles vaccine had an impact on child survival,” he said. And sure enough, “nearly every time that someone had died [of any cause], they had not been vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later studies from several countries with data on childhood mortality before and after introduction of the measles vaccine likewise showed a minimum 50% reduction in mortality among children under age 5 — “an unbelievable effect,” as Aaby put it. Children who had previously survived a measles infection had even lower risks of mortality: It’s fair to say that what didn’t kill them did indeed make them stronger, but at a terrible risk, since a quarter of measles-infected children did not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other vaccines were likewise shown to reduce childhood mortality, without the risks associated with infection, and to an astonishing degree: the BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) did so by 45%, for example. Aaby’s findings  were initially dismissed, since he was an anthropologist with no medical credentials  (he now has a PhD in medicine), but no longer. In 2016 the WHO noted the otherwise inexplicable effects of BCG and measles vaccines on childhood mortality, while in 2020 the widely-respected journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00018-3"&gt;Nature included non-specific effects in a list of&lt;/a&gt; “milestones in vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Child mortality under age 5 has declined by 86 percent, and there is no way you can explain it by controlling measles and whooping cough and tuberculosis,” Aaby emphasized to Salon. “It’s the immune stimulation that we have provided” through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the protection vaccines provide against a specific pathogen — we need boosters for COVID-19 because the vaccine’s effects wane over time — this enhanced general immune protection may last for just a few months or endure for years, as with the effect of measles vaccination on overall health. Early findings show that existing COVID vaccines may also offer beneficial non-specific effects in similar fashion, as Aaby suggests in a PowerPoint presentation he shared with Salon, by revving up our immune systems against other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this amounts to saying that vaccines have no risks, or even that their non-specific effects are always beneficial. Aaby found, for example, that what’s known as the high-titer measles vaccine, when given to very young children, was later associated with increased mortality for girls, a finding of sex differences in immune response that has been seen with other vaccines as well. (That specific vaccine is no longer in use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research revealed that it was the sequence in which vaccines were administered, not the vaccines themselves, that was responsible for higher mortality. Changing the sequence of vaccines, usually by giving live vaccines before non-live ones, maximizes the beneficial effect and removes that additional risk for girls, apparently by programming the innate immune system in a better way. Aaby is now testing whether combining live and non-live vaccines may reduce negative effects while maintaining beneficial effects, both the specific protection against a given infection and the non-specific strengthening of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to evaluate the benefits and risks of any vaccine carefully, of course. But too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects when the overall protection offered by a vaccine far outweighs any statistical risk. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by not getting a given vaccine. Epidemiologists and public health researchers are supposed to crunch the numbers and figure these things out, and to adjust recommendations as new findings come in, especially recommendations about what vaccines children need, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many experts in the field, Martin is concerned that HHS Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent dismissal&lt;/a&gt; of the entire CDC panel of vaccine experts who do that, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;their replacement with known vaccine “skeptics”&lt;/a&gt; or outright opponents&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; puts that at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="top_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting a given vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I worry what data they are going to use,” Martin said. “if they are not acknowledging the data that’s there and being generated. It is ready for them to review right now. This is an ongoing process that we’re always iterating on, every year, putting out vaccine data” to guide policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High child mortality was taken for granted for centuries. So what happened? In a word, vaccines happened. Anyone who visits an older cemetery anywhere in North America is startled to see the large numbers of tombstones inscribed with the names of infants and young children. Such deaths are relatively rare on our continent today, but Aaby’s work suggests that this dramatic change is not purely due to the prevention of the specific diseases targeted by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, he contends, the “enormous reduction we’ve had in [child] mortality in low-income countries in the last 30 or 40 years” can only be explained by the non-specific effects he has documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby and his colleagues have followed populations before and after the oral polio vaccine campaigns that began in 1995 and ended in roughly 2015 in various low-income countries such as Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Bangladesh and Uganda. They determined that childhood mortality overall was roughly 25% lower after the campaign than before. Add to that similar effects from BCG and measles vaccination, and we have, Aaby says, an explanation for the dramatic decline in childhood mortality in many such countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major reason why the U.S. and Western Europe have seen dramatic population increase over the last 200-plus years, Aaby says, is the introduction of the smallpox vaccine in 1800. That wasn’t just that vaccine prevented one specific and often deadly disease, he argues, but because of the vaccine’s overall effect on immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of things that we’ve forgotten to say” to vaccine-hesitant parents concerned about rare negative effects, said Martin, largely “because measles infection in the United States has been so incredibly rare for the last 30 years.” In other words, at a cultural level we have simply forgotten how common, and how serious, the long-term damage  from exposure to measles and other diseases used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people in other countries who have had endemic measles understand that more acutely than we do,” Martin said. In many such countries, people have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01143-8"&gt;high confidence in vaccination&lt;/a&gt; despite less reliable access to vaccines, and the reverse is also true, with people in higher-income countries expressing greater vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there’s evidence to suggest it may have been a mistake to stop administering the smallpox vaccine after the total elimination of smallpox, or to end the BCG vaccine as tuberculosis infection became rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large Danish study compared children who received the BCG and smallpox vaccines to a cohort that did not. Over nearly 40 years, researchers have found that those who received either vaccine as children had &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/695/2622844"&gt;significantly lower risks of dying of natural causes&lt;/a&gt; — not just in childhood but clear into their 40s, which was as far as the data followed them. Just because certain diseases are eliminated, Aaby argues, is not necessarily a good reason to remove the relevant vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these almost magical-seeming but real and meaningful effects of vaccines, Martin was dismayed to see experts like the highly qualified and vetted CDC vaccine panel members dismissed by Kennedy and accused, without evidence, of conflicts of interest. “This is work that people are doing because they think it’s important,” she said. “They’re not getting any financial benefit. It was jarring to see it swapped out so quickly like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

The work, which tracked nearly five thousand adults over fifteen years, indicates that a wide waist and depressed mood may amplify each other’s harmful effects, raising death risk beyond what either factor predicts on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team set out to understand why sparse sexual activity so often accompanies poor health outcomes. Earlier population surveys have shown that low sexual frequency is linked to higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and early death. Yet it remained unclear which specific biological or psychological traits best mark that heightened danger, and whether those traits interact in a way that makes the whole risk greater than the sum of its parts. By pinpointing modifiable warning signs, the authors hoped to guide physicians toward tailored prevention strategies for a group that has received little clinical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the investigators drew on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an ongoing program that combines interviews, physical examinations, and long-term mortality tracking. They pooled six survey cycles collected between 2005 and 2016 and focused on 4,978 participants aged twenty to fifty-nine who reported having vaginal or anal sex fewer than twelve times in the previous year. Respondents lacking a sexual partner, those with intellectual impairments, and those with missing key data were excluded to keep the analysis consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant answered the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, a widely used screening tool for depressive symptoms. A score of ten or higher flagged probable depression. The researchers also calculated five different measures of body fat distribution. Traditional body mass index, which relates weight to height, was included, but they paid special attention to A Body Shape Index. This newer metric combines waist circumference, height, and weight to capture abdominal fat more precisely than body mass index alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from any cause up to December 31, 2019 were confirmed through linkage to the National Death Index. The median follow-up time was just over two years, and the maximum was fifteen. In total, 215 participants—about four percent of the sample—died during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical models that accounted for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol use, blood pressure, kidney function, diabetes, and other potential confounders revealed that A Body Shape Index stood out as the strongest predictor of mortality among the five fat-related measures. A value of 0.082 or higher defined the high-risk group. People at or above that threshold were nearly twice as likely to die as peers with smaller waists, even after adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression carried a similar weight. Participants who screened positive were eighty-six percent more likely to die than those with lower scores. Most striking, though, was what happened when both factors appeared together. Individuals who had a wide waist and met criteria for depression faced almost quadruple the death risk of those who had neither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interaction analysis estimated that roughly half of the deaths in this high-risk subgroup could be attributed to the combined influence of abdominal fat and depressive symptoms, meaning the two conditions seem to magnify each other rather than operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survival curves painted a stark picture. Among men with both risk factors, only about seventy-six percent were alive at fifteen years, compared with ninety-one percent of similarly affected women. The sex gap echoes laboratory findings that male endothelial cells in fat tissue show more inflammatory and aging-related gene activity than female cells, which may leave men more vulnerable to the vascular damage associated with obesity. Depression may widen the divide, as men often delay care and present with more severe symptoms than women by the time they reach treatment, potentially worsening outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then built a practical tool clinicians could use to estimate survival odds in this population. Feeding ten easily obtained variables—sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, waist-based body shape index, sexual frequency, heart disease history, depression score, and age—into a machine-learning method called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, they produced a nomogram that predicted three-, five-, and ten-year mortality with an accuracy of about seventy-eight percent. Such a chart could help physicians and counselors decide when to prioritize weight management, mental health care, or sexual health interventions during routine visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, has some caveats. Sexual activity was self-reported, raising the possibility of recall errors or underreporting, especially for a sensitive topic. Because the survey asked only broad frequency categories, the threshold of fewer than twelve encounters per year lumped together people who never have sex with those who do so monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational design also means the study cannot confirm cause and effect. Abdominal fat and depression might lead to lower sexual frequency, or the absence of sexual intimacy and its psychological benefits might worsen mood and metabolic health. Future investigations that track changes in these factors over time, or that test targeted interventions, are needed to untangle directionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that the sample represents the United States. Cultural norms around body image, mental health, and sexual behavior differ worldwide, so studies in other countries are required before generalizing the findings. Finally, individuals without a sexual partner were not included, yet they may share health challenges with the low-frequency group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study highlights two straightforward signals—waist size adjusted for height and weight, and depressive symptoms—that clinicians can measure during a single office visit. When they appear together in adults who rarely have sex, the combination seems to foreshadow a markedly shorter life span. Screening for both factors, and addressing them in tandem, may provide a new path to improving longevity among people whose intimate lives are quieter than average but whose health risks demand louder attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.129" target="_blank"&gt;Synergistic effects of a body shape index and depression on mortality in individuals with low sexual frequency&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tian-Qi Teng, Meng-Meng Wang, De-Gang Mo, Yan-you Xie, Rui Chen, Jia-Chao Xu, Jing Liu, and Hai-Chu Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:21:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQWXZ6ZS1LLVljdGpYOUNQaW1nUWFrOHd2cTFPcHV1V2p4SWQ0Zk96OWFXekpiMDhmeDdJek84TVQ2MXZkRmFlVXZOUnpUMWV6UHJsV1VCSDdyQzJFSTdPWDRtUmYxVk00eGRCRzNmbFh5T2V0bmstR3Q2NUJjTzF4NkNaWHRuVm81YjlXYzJ1c0ZRcml6d2x1eWpFT3VHSEFQX0ZJWkl6TnNIT1I0emlXMDUzT0tWQ3ExcmxMbmc1SQ</guid></item><item><title>在俄勒冈州的蚊子中检测到西尼罗河病毒- KOIN.com | West Nile virus detected in mosquitoes in Oregon - KOIN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOWXFIUEluOEowMTFyU2V0Q2ItXzdTNzh4WkhncjhUWklldkR4dU95YzVjNFl3ZGRrRVRITWRvel9TUmdmRGVFa1AxeUxwZ3R3eUJwaWJCQ0VxTFNFM1FyczQ5UnNMYmtseEd3ZlpMOUdxR2V3bFZBbGU2WmpuT3Rfc0J4clpDYnZtdkHSAY8BQVVfeXFMTnhyVGExdlNyU1RvekNBX0Zva0NHU1I0aTQ5eTk5SV9GYzRzbHJWX2h4d1EwNzN1SVVXN3VMSmZCUWNSc29DaW1FcXlyRjVBenZDcHJlOXBVLXkxN1BxUGJHS2t1cGtic2EyeGRDLXhqaHAwVWJlaVZvcGlnaThQZVhuc1Jkcmd5enR0OHYxMEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. (&lt;a href="http://koin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KOIN&lt;/a&gt;) — Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have been identified in Oregon for the first time this year, according to the Oregon Health Authority. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say three pools containing up to 50 mosquitoes tested positive for the virus in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://malheurhealth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/july8_mchd_westnilevirus_release.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Malheur County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, with the county’s own health department stating the samples were collected in Little Valley. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. While OHA says most of those infected don’t become sick, 20% experience flu-like symptoms, including fever, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, muscle weakness, shaking, paralysis or rash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="5qtk5xjc" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Officials say anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical attention, as the virus can sometimes leading to serious illness or death. West Nile also presents a severe risk to people aged 55 and older, those who are immuno-compromised, as well as people with diabetes or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="5qtk5xjc" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Further, there are currently no vaccines against the virus or medicines to treat it in people, OHA says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As mosquitoes breed and thrive in warm temperatures – especially in summer heat – OHA offered the following tips to prevent mosquito bites in case they carry the virus:  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. OHA recommends products containing DEET, oil of lemon eucalyptus or Picaridin.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid applying repellent to children’s hands because it can irritate the eyes and mouth.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Place mosquito netting over infant carriers when outdoors with infants.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider staying indoors at dawn and dusk, as these are peak mosquito biting times.&lt;/li&gt;

And while the precise long-term health implications of vaping remain hazy — vapes are still so new, in the grand scheme of things, that some health problems they cause probably haven't even shown up yet — but as the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/well/vaping-health-risks.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, doctors are startling to advise serious caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular expert and doctor James Stein of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine told the newspaper that when you vape "all day long, over and over and over again — you’re basically walking around with high blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's because vaping places undue stress on the cardiovascular system, leading your heart rate to rise and your blood vessels to constrict — and it can also lead to an irregular heartbeat condition &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/well/live/afib-atrial-fibrillation.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;known as atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke, or even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a cardiovascular expert, Stein also is acutely aware of the damage that vaping can cause to the lungs, which are &lt;a href="https://www.visiblebody.com/learn/circulatory/circulatory-pulmonary-systemic-circulation" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;closely linked to the heart&lt;/a&gt; via the circulatory system and &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/heart-lung-relationship" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;often implicated in heart disorders&lt;/a&gt;. As such, he noted that vaping is known to cause shortness of breath and a persistent cough — which also, obviously, affects traditional cigarette smokers — due to the chronic inflammation associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaping can also, the Wisconsin doctor noted, worsen symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). By now, that sort of outcome should almost be a given, considering that heavy vape use has been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans, better known as "popcorn lung," for &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/popcorn-lung-risk-ecigs" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Irfan Rahman, a nicotine researcher at the University of Rochester Medicine, told the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;that vapes release more harmful chemicals the hotter they get. Those chemicals, in turn, harm blood vessels, promote inflammation, and increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, people will have to make their own decisions about whether to vape, regardless of how many scary studies come out — but Stein characterized that choice as a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Common sense tells you — your mom would tell you — that a superheated chemical inhaling right into your lungs isn’t going to be good," the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on heart health choices:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/thc-edibles-health-risk" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Study Finds Serious Risk to Eating Edibles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5KVGRqQ1JvTy11RW8zeGcxaUM0TFJsb2JwTWVYVmNYZ1J3aWVlbUFfeXlvajBxeGFnZVhyajh5M3RkMGsyTEFCUzN6UE1FQWJMOW5SalBsWng2djhKOExsMW9iNUgxQQ</guid></item><item><title>冰浴趋势引发健康问题。以下是保持安全的6条建议。- ScienceAlert | Ice Bath Trend Raises Health Concerns.

			&lt;p&gt;Walk through any trendy suburb and you might find a new "wellness" studio offering ice baths or "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466853X08000679"&gt;contrast therapy&lt;/a&gt;" (a sauna and ice bath combo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll social media, and you're likely to come across &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lorencecil1/cold-plunge-pool-review"&gt;influencers preaching the cold plunge gospel&lt;/a&gt; with cult-like zeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice baths have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/01/cure-or-killer-the-rewards-and-very-real-risks-of-the-cold-water-plunge"&gt;gone mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. Initially practised mainly among &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/25/olympic-demand-for-unproven-ice-therapy-is-unsustainable-scientists-say"&gt;high-performance athletes&lt;/a&gt;, cold water immersion is now a booming business model: sold as recovery, discipline and therapy all in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-ice-baths-really-work-heres-what-the-science-says?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Do Ice Baths Really Work? Here's What The Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ice-baths-are-popular-for-exercise-recovery-and-general-wellness-but-what-does-the-science-say-250649"&gt;are questionable&lt;/a&gt; and, importantly, ice baths can have &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1332.abstract"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt; – particularly for people who have limited experience using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From Roman times to today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold water immersion isn't a new concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "&lt;a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/romanurbs/baths.html"&gt;frigidarium&lt;/a&gt;" – a room with a cold plunge pool or bath – was a feature in most Roman bathhouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, athletes have used &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-cold-water-swim-good-for-you-or-more-likely-to-send-you-to-the-bottom-89513"&gt;cold water immersion&lt;/a&gt;, such as swims in cold water, for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167595" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167595" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend1_642.jpg" alt="athlete in an ice bath" class="wp-image-167595 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend1_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend1_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167595" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ice baths have been used by athletes for decades. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGYTKMmfj0/"&gt;Ivan Rodriguez Alba/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in recent years, with the proliferation of &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/fact-or-fad-ice-baths-are-on-the-rise-but-do-they-really-work/news-story/f9dc9afbff04f7c0ff9e597224e1ec75"&gt;commercial cold plunge centres&lt;/a&gt;, there's been an explosion in people using ice baths recreationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are even setting up their own ice baths at home. The &lt;a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/cold-plunge-tub-market"&gt;global cold plunge tub market&lt;/a&gt; was valued at close to US$338 million in 2024 and is projected to reach nearly $483 million by 2033.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media shows serene influencers meditating through the pain, claiming it boosts mental health, serotonin, testosterone, and their metabolism. But does the evidence stack up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice baths can reduce muscle soreness after intense training, however the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3766664/"&gt;effect is modest and short-lived&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lim2.53"&gt;Some research&lt;/a&gt; shows cold water immersion can improve mood after a single exposure in young, healthy people, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306456523002681"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; doesn't find these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most claims about mental health, testosterone and weight loss aren't backed by strong evidence. Rather, they're anecdotal and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/get-big-or-die-trying-social-media-is-driving-mens-use-of-steroids-heres-how-to-mitigate-the-risks-253110"&gt;amplified by influencers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does an ice bath involve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At commercial establishments, patrons can often use the ice baths as they please during a booked session. Ice bath temperatures often range anywhere from 3°C to 15°C. There normally isn't actual ice in the bath, but some people add blocks of ice to their ice baths at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses offering ice baths don't always actively supervise patrons or monitor a person's time in the ice bath. They may leave their customers to self-regulate, assuming people will know to get out of the water before they pass their body's limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what are the risks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold water immersion &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2691172/"&gt;triggers a powerful physiological response&lt;/a&gt;. When you hit cold water below 15°C, your &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/diving-into-cold-water-can-be-deadly-heres-how-to-survive-it-119341"&gt;body launches into cold shock&lt;/a&gt;. Gasping occurs and breathing becomes rapid and uncontrollable. Heart rate spikes. Blood pressure rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying in the water for too long &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00258172231182601"&gt;can lead to hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where a person's core body temperature drops dangerously low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shivering may &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00002.2015"&gt;begin within minutes in cold water&lt;/a&gt;. Confusion or fainting are more serious signs that hypothermia may be developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, this "cold shock" response can lead to a heart attack &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/chri/fulltext/2014/01040/stroke_after_cold_bath.16.aspx"&gt;or stroke&lt;/a&gt; – especially if you have an undiagnosed condition affecting your heart, blood vessels or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167597" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend2_642.jpg" alt="man in ice bath" class="wp-image-167597 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ice_bath_trend2_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167597" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cold shock can lead to a heart attack or stroke. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADxIwwYEkc/"&gt;Sviatlana Lazarenka/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back as 1969, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1982576/"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; even experienced swimmers could struggle after just a few minutes in cold water. Participants were immersed in water at 4.7°C while fully clothed and asked to swim as if trying to reach safety. Some developed serious respiratory distress and had to stop swimming within as little as 90 seconds, well before any measurable drop in core body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after you get out, your core temperature can continue to fall – a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1988.65.4.1535"&gt;afterdrop&lt;/a&gt;. So you can encounter problems, such as collapse, even &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1815081/"&gt;after leaving the water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even young, healthy people &lt;a href="https://www.royallifesaving.com.au/about/news-and-updates/news/2024/feb/position-statement-cold-water-immersion-therapy"&gt;can be caught off guard&lt;/a&gt;. The body isn't designed to endure freezing water for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently one of us (Sam Cornell) had to provide first aid at an ice bath venue in Sydney. A young man collapsed after staying in an ice bath for ten minutes. He was shivering uncontrollably and clearly suffering from cold shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure can also cause long-term damage to nerves and blood vessels in the hands and feet, known as &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/blogs/improving-health-and-wellbeing/cold-water-therapy-what-are-the-benefits-and-dangers-of-ice-baths-wild-swimming-and-freezing-showers"&gt;non-freezing cold injury&lt;/a&gt;. This is more likely if someone spends an extended period immersed in cold water. Symptoms such as numbness, pain and sensitivity to cold can persist for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 tips for safer recreational ice bath use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ice bath trend is part of a broader wellness movement, promoted to young men in particular, where discomfort is repackaged as discipline. Push through &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/from-the-liver-king-to-ultramarathons-fitness-influencers-are-glorifying-extreme-masculinity-where-pain-is-the-point-256817"&gt;the pain&lt;/a&gt;. Master your body. If you feel terrible, you must be doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But behind the hype lies a less appealing truth. Ice baths &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1332.abstract"&gt;can be dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We advise caution, but if you do choose to try an ice bath, treat it seriously and &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1332.abstract"&gt;follow these tips&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2022/12/09/youre-not-a-polar-bear-the-plunge-into-cold-water-comes-with-risks"&gt;risk of harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;a href="https://www.nib.com.au/the-checkup/everyday-health/health-and-wellbeing-habits/benefits-risks-cold-water-therapy"&gt;get checked out first&lt;/a&gt;. If you or your family have any heart, stroke or respiratory risk, skip it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your limits: being fit doesn't protect you &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2040-4603.2016.tb00673.x"&gt;from cold shock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start gradually: begin with short warm to cold showers before full immersion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never go alone: always have someone with you, especially if you're new to ice baths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it short and watch the temperature: limit sessions to 3–5 minutes and remember, problems can still occur after you get out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognise the signs of danger: symptoms such as shivering, numbness and confusion can all seem like part of the experience to someone bent on pushing themselves. But these can be &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2004/1215/p2325.html"&gt;signs of hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260206/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The practice &lt;a href="https://scottsdalerecovery.com/the-origins-of-speedballing-mixing-heroin-cocaine/"&gt;stems from the early 1900s,&lt;/a&gt; when World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once associated with high-profile figures like &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/article/john-belushis-final-drug-filled-nights-in-nyc-before-his-death/"&gt;John Belushi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/10/river-phoenix-overdose-dan-aykroyd"&gt;River Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/us/chris-farley-s-death-laid-to-drug-overdose.html"&gt;Chris Farley&lt;/a&gt;, this dangerous polysubstance use has become a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16318"&gt;leading cause of overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; across the United States since the early- to mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an assistant professor of public health who has written extensively on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14659891.2020.1760380"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2020.1747478"&gt;opioid use&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2024.10.012"&gt;dangerous combination of the two&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. As these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why speedballing?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dating back to the 1970s, the term speedballing originally referred to the combination of heroin and cocaine. Combining stimulants and opioids—the former’s “rush” with the latter’s calming effect—creates a dangerous physiological conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"&gt;70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022&lt;/a&gt; also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01969.x"&gt;sought to experience the euphoric “rush”&lt;/a&gt; from the stimulant and the calming effects of the opioid. However, with the &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/fentanyl"&gt;proliferation of fentanyl—&lt;/a&gt;which is far more potent than heroin—this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.110985"&gt;often mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes without the user’s knowledge, leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307212"&gt;unintentional overdoses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The rise in speedballing is part of a broader trend of polysubstance use in the U.S. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/overdose-deaths-fentanyl-laced-stimulants-have-risen-50-fold?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;50-fold&lt;/a&gt;, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has been called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307948"&gt;fourth wave of the opioid epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354919887741"&gt;toxic and contaminated drug supply&lt;/a&gt; has exacerbated this crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A dangerous combination of physiological effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stimulants like cocaine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.85.2.407"&gt;increase heart rate and blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2012.02307.x"&gt;opioids suppress respiratory function&lt;/a&gt;. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. People who use both substances are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14506-w"&gt;more than twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. Users may experience heightened &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000069"&gt;anxiety, depression,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000001417"&gt;paranoia&lt;/a&gt;. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, including &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/citation/1991/03000/speedballs__a_new_cause_of_intraoperative.20.aspx"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01601.x"&gt;heart attack,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-012-0325-0"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The strain on the heart and blood vessels from the stimulant, combined with the depressant effects of the opioid, increases the risk of these life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Addressing the crisis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. I believe that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/overdose-prevention/harm-reduction"&gt;educational campaigns&lt;/a&gt; can inform the public about the risks of combining stimulants and opioids and the potential for unintentional fentanyl exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a great need for better &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/advocacy/news/samhsa-guidelines-substance-use"&gt;access to treatment for people with stimulant use ddisorder—a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ifeet.org/files/DSM-5-TR.pdf"&gt;condition defined as&lt;/a&gt; the continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this and &lt;a href="https://cureaddictionnow.org/cure-addiction-now-bridges-funding-gap-in-addiction-treatments/"&gt;other substance use disorders are underfunded&lt;/a&gt; and less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Implementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations, and health care providers, such as providing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000001321"&gt;fentanyl test strips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306124"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt;—a medication that reverses opioid overdoses—can&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-approval-of-over-the-counter-narcan-is-an-important-step-in-the-effort-to-combat-the-us-opioid-crisis-198497"&gt; save lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These measures allow individuals to test their drugs for the presence of fentanyl and have immediate access to overdose-reversing medication. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257425/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/andrew-yockey-2372763"&gt;Andrew Yockey&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-mississippi-2400"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.

In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, loss of Egr-1 led to reduced regulatory T cell activity and heightened inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed Egr-1 directly boosts the expression of Foxp3, a protein essential for Treg cells, via the TGF-β signaling pathway. Researchers also demonstrated that a natural compound, calycosin, can activate Egr-1, restoring Treg function and alleviating disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egr-1 Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Egr-1 enhances Foxp3 expression, strengthening regulatory T cells and reducing autoimmune inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice lacking Egr-1 showed more severe symptoms and fewer Treg cells in a model of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The natural compound calycosin activated Egr-1, improving immune balance and disease outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affect millions of people worldwide. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions arise when the body’s immune system fails to distinguish between “self” and “foreign” cells, and mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, resulting in persistent inflammation and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to these autoimmune responses are CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, a class of immune cells that can either promote or suppress the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111592"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev.jpg" alt="This shows DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/immune-regulation-Ms-gene-neuroscienev-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After identifying Egr-1 as a regulatory gene, the team assessed its role by using genetically engineered mice lacking Egr-1 in CD4+ T cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;) are a special subtype of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that act as the immune system’s peacekeepers. T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells, marked by protein Foxp3, help in suppressing harmful immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the function of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells is compromised, as seen in cases of MS and IBD, the immune response is dominated by the Th1 and Th17 cells (other CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cell subtypes), which promote inflammation, further worsening the disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, boosting the development and activity of T&lt;sub&gt;reg &lt;/sub&gt;cells is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach, but the mechanisms underlying its effective regulation remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of a deeper understanding of these mechanisms, a team of Chinese scientists led by Dr. Xiaojun Wu and Dr. Fei Huang from the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines, SHUTCM, China, and Dr. Weidong Pan from the Department of Neurology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China, explored the role of Early Growth Response Gene 1 (Egr-1) in promoting the activity of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a well-established animal model of MS, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to confirm the mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study were published in Volume 8 of &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on April 15, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborating more, Dr. Wu, the lead author of this study, says “We started by screening the genes that appeared different between mice with mild and severe EAE.” Further, he adds, “Among the top identified genes in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, Egr-1 stood out as significantly downregulated in severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; as a regulatory gene, the team assessed its role by using genetically engineered mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. These mice were induced with EAE and tracked for disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the immune cell compositions in the spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system of these mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mice lacking Egr-1 showed worse disease, fewer T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells, and more inflammatory TH17 and TH1 cells” explains Dr. Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also conducted additional &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments. By analyzing isolated human CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from MS patients and healthy donors, they confirmed that both &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Foxp3&lt;/em&gt; levels were reduced in patient samples. Further, to determine whether &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; directly regulates &lt;em&gt;Foxp3&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation, which revealed that &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; binds to the &lt;em&gt;Foxp3&lt;/em&gt; promoter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, using luciferase reporter assays, they also confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; binding increases &lt;em&gt;Foxp3&lt;/em&gt; gene activity. They then traced the pathway to TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor Beta) signaling via the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a unique mechanism of &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;explains Dr. Pan, “First, TGF-β activates the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates &lt;u&gt;Egr-1&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;u&gt;Egr-1&lt;/u&gt; then directly binds to the &lt;u&gt;Foxp3&lt;/u&gt; promoter to enhance its expression, bypassing the classical Smad3-dependent pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the researchers also investigated the effect of a natural compound, Calycosin, which acts as an &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; agonist. Treatment with calycosin restored T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cell functions and improve clinical outcomes in mice with EAE, but only in those with functional &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study underscores the essential role of &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; in T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cell development and function, identifying it as a central molecular switch in immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By elucidating its mechanism and validating the effect of a natural &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; agonist, the study suggests that targeting &lt;em&gt;Egr-1&lt;/em&gt; may offer a promising treatment strategy, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9ddc0c8c7ddc0c8c7e9cac8dadd87c6dbce87cac7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tian Tian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cast.org.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tian Tian – Research&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.34133/research.0662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Growth Response Gene 1 Benefits Autoimmune Disease by Promoting Regulatory T Cell Differentiation as a Regulator of Foxp3&lt;/a&gt;” by Weidong Pan et al. &lt;em&gt;Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Growth Response Gene 1 Benefits Autoimmune Disease by Promoting Regulatory T Cell Differentiation as a Regulator of Foxp3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foxp3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulatory T (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;) cells, as one of the subtypes of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, are the crucial gatekeeper in the pathogenesis of self-antigen reactive diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, we demonstrated that the selective ablation of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in murine models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of Egr-1 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, obtained from EAE mice and naïve CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, impeded the differentiation and influence of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;. Importantly, in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells of multiple sclerosis patients, both Egr-1 and Foxp3 were found to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies showed that distinct from the classical Smad3 route, TGF-β could activate Egr-1 through the Raf–Erk signaling route to promote Foxp3 genetic modulation, thereby promoting T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cell differentiation and reducing EAE inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel natural Egr-1 agonist, calycosin, was found to attenuate EAE progression by regulating the differentiation of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the above results indicate the value of Egr-1, as a novel Foxp3 transactivator, for the differentiation of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells in the development of self-antigen reactive diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:51:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE45bUkxUFZ6UDZDeUZKcEZvWXpDaFB6Q0pJSU5IanRpQ2U0UW9XOG5hVGNDSVRsb2tTQjRMMThnVGV4MDhOR0UxNGpmMTdYU25NNE45elFkREw5bFVuVW5OSFFkVWdCMEM1cjJzcC1WMllzNUE</guid></item><item><title>干细胞治疗逆转人类患者听力损失的开始-未来主义 | Stem Cell Treatment to Reverse Hearing Loss Kicking Off in Human Patients - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9INVdIcTVlM1lKZUpWc3doMWJXX2Z0dDVBcHB0YjdfYW9WWEYzM3llZ05sVlZFb295X1Y1el9vWUozQ3ZFTHFzRW9fV052SmYtNUZ0VUM4VFVUOHQtTThjMWNOVGpGaUdjMThPZ3JPRVpyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first-ever human trial exploring the use of stem cell therapy to reverse hearing loss is about to be under way, after getting the go-ahead from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conducted by researchers from the University of Sheffield who formed their own spin-out company, the treatment targets sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by physical damage to the tiny structures of the inner ear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a nutshell, the treatment, dubbed Rincell-1, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is intended to regrow damaged nerves in the cochlea and allow them to start sending signals to the brain again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our research into Rincell-1 has consistently shown its ability to target and restore the delicate neural structures of the inner ear," Marcelo Rivolta from the University of Sheffield, chief scientific officer at the spin-out biotech company Rinri Therapeutics, said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/first-human-trial-of-regenerative-cell-therapy-for-sensorineural-hearing-loss-approved/194974/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about the work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than a billion people worldwide are affected by some form of hearing loss, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_2" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;according to the WHO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Existing treatments, like cochlear implants, don't fully restore a patient's hearing, and require that the cochlea — the center piece of the inner ear that picks up sound and turns it into electrical signals — isn't significantly damaged to begin with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key to the cochlea's function are the hair cells that line its surface, which are responsible for detecting sound. If these are severely damaged, it's game over: the hair cells are incapable of dividing to form new ones, meaning that they don't regenerate. This is called sensorineural hearing loss, and it's why your hearing inevitably worsens with age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attempts to regrow these receptors have long been the white whale of modern medical science, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the researchers hope they've found it in Rincell-1. The treatment uses embryonic stem cells designed to grow into auditory neuron cells, which form the wiring that connect&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; the hair cells to the brain stem. These are administered into the cochlea during the surgery to emplace the cochlear implants. Once on site, the stem cells form auditory neurons that help reconnect the out-of-commission hair cells so they can send signals again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are taking the approach of transplanting in cells that can become functional mature cells and restore the cytoarchitecture of the inner ear, and therefore, restore hearing," Simon Chandler, CEO of Rinri Therapeutics, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/stem-cell-therapy-hearing-disorders/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Labiotech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on an episode of its "Beyond Biotech" podcast in June.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The randomized trial will be conducted in the UK and will involve 20 patients who will undergo cochlear implant surgery. Half of the patients will have severe-to-profound age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis, and the remainder will have what's known as auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD), which is when the inner ear can detect sound but is unable to send the signals to the brain. Patients within each group will be randomly assigned to either receive a single dose of Rincell-1, or receive no dose and rely on the cochlear implant alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the podcast, Chandler said that the Rincell-1 treatment can be used alongside cochlear implants, but didn't rule out the possibility that it would be used on its own, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Needless to say, it'd be a game-changer if it turns out to be effective in either scenario.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on stem cells: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/diabetic-woman-stem-cells-insulin" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Diabetic Woman No Longer Needs Insulin After Single Dose of Experimental Stem Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:15:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9INVdIcTVlM1lKZUpWc3doMWJXX2Z0dDVBcHB0YjdfYW9WWEYzM3llZ05sVlZFb295X1Y1el9vWUozQ3ZFTHFzRW9fV052SmYtNUZ0VUM4VFVUOHQtTThjMWNOVGpGaUdjMThPZ3JPRVpyQQ</guid></item><item><title>随着美国官员瞄准mRNA疫苗，癌症研究的“巨大不确定性” -卫报 | ‘Tremendous uncertainty’ for cancer research as US officials target mRNA vaccines - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQb3gtVW5FUWM0MzhqU2ViR3RtZHNnNHlPeUFmX3gwSGpZZDZ2b2FFeVlzUW9pWHRmNWlTUS1ac3R4Q3Y4VnZfaGxuYUc1S0Jid05jam1hS2RMa1dBM0hlSlVScUJEWFBaNS1EUjR5VFItU3ViY2o5RVFQQkpDRTRLd3J5R1pRbzQ4TU5jYlpwSGZqVURoMDJVb1dZeV9tdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As US regulators restrict Covid mRNA vaccines and as independent vaccine advisers re-examine the shots, scientists fear that an unlikely target could be next: cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines have shown promise in treating and preventing cancers that have often been difficult to address, such as pancreatic cancer, brain tumors and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/trump-administration","type":"Keyword","title":"Trump administration"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","type":"Keyword","title":"US politics"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"campaign/email/the-stakes-us-election-edition","type":"Campaign","title":"This Week in Trumpland"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/12/mrna-vaccine-cancer-research-trump-administration","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But groundbreaking research could stall as federal and state officials &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/mrna-vaccines-trump-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;target mRNA shots&lt;/a&gt;, including ending federal funding for bird flu mRNA vaccines, restricting who may receive existing mRNA vaccines and, in some places, proposing laws against the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;

could be cut in half. And a small study co-authored by Sayour on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424003982?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; showed the vaccines started affecting the tumors within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like any vaccine, mRNA cancer vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike foreign pathogens, such as infectious diseases, cancer is caused by the growth of the patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some cancer vaccines are highly personalized, using a patient’s own cancer cells to treat their tumors or train their immune system to kill off those dangerous cells if they recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ability to create specific vaccines for patients has tremendous, tremendous promise, but that was technology not possible five or 10 years ago,” said Sasson. “It really is a shift in the paradigm of how we treat cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers are also investigating vaccines that would target cancer cells more broadly by identifying “fingerprints” of certain cancers, said Sayour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, the vaccines could be created for other conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It has potential to get rid of a lot of the chronic morbidity we see from disease, to cure diseases that are degenerative, to overcome cancer evolution and cure patients,” Sayour said. “mRNA could be the healthcare that the movable-type printing press was for human knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet federal and state decision-makers have targeted mRNA vaccines in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-shots-fda-trump-kennedy-fda-overruled-3ac51f93225aa5f20d5840468fff8b02" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines-prasad" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;overrode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Tk8.8Vg-.OB4eDrjDIBEu&amp;amp;smid=url-share" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; at the agency to limit some Covid vaccines, including a new mRNA shot from Moderna, to children older than 12. Prasad also introduced similar limitations on the Covid shot from Novavax, which does not use mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Thursday, the FDA approved the original Covid mRNA vaccine from Moderna for children between the ages of six months and 11 years – but they narrowed its use to children with at least one underlying condition. (The vaccine for people older than 12 was approved in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prasad argued, in two memos recently released by the FDA, that the risks of Covid had dropped, while “known and unknown” side-effects could outweigh the benefits of getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Covid remains a leading cause of death in the US, with &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;178 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the week ending 7 June, the last week for which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers complete data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) in June, two of the new vaccine advisers – appointed by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, after he fired the previous 17 advisers – broached the safety of Covid mRNA vaccines, indicating future scrutiny of these shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse who has volunteered for years with the National Vaccine Information Center, said she was “very concerned” about side-effects from the Covid mRNA shots and asked for more data on safety, including “reproductive toxicity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Shortly before being appointed to the ACIP, Pebsworth and the founder of the National Vaccine Information Center &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/vicky-pebsworth-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the FDA should not recommend mRNA Covid-19 shots for anyone “until adequate scientific evidence demonstrates safety and effectiveness for both the healthy and those who are elderly or chronically ill”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the June ACIP meeting, Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said he believed mRNA side-effects were “being reported at rates that are far exceeding other vaccines even when you normalize to the number of doses, which does suggest something, I think”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-30" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; Covid shots the “deadliest vaccine ever made”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In May, Kennedy changed Covid vaccine recommendations from “should” to “may” for children, and eliminated the recommendation for pregnant women entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also in May, the US canceled $766m in contracts for research on mRNA vaccines against H5N1 bird flu. Investment in the mRNA vaccine was not “scientifically or ethically justifiable”, Andrew Nixon, the HHS communications director, said in &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/06/hhs-misleads-on-mrna-vaccine-safety-after-pulling-moderna-funding/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt; to the media, adding that the “mRNA technology remains under-tested”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Millions of mRNA vaccines have been given around the world, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in multiple studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bans or limitations on mRNA vaccinations have been introduced in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven states&lt;/a&gt;. One such bill in &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/billbookmark/?yr=2025&amp;amp;bn=S1036" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; sought to pause “gene therapy immunizations” for 10 years – a category in which they incorrectly place Covid vaccines, and which could affect other therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, in Washington state, commissioners in Franklin county passed a &lt;a href="https://franklincowa.portal.civicclerk.com/event/350/files/attachment/2292" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; urging the local health facility to stop providing and promoting gene-therapy vaccines; they also incorrectly included Covid mRNA shots in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s this scorched-earth mentality now, but I’m hopeful that once the dust settles, we’ll be able to reinstate or allow vaccine work for cancer purposes to proceed,” Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;second leading&lt;/a&gt; cause of death in the US, and &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html#:~:text=Approximately%2039.3%20percent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two in five people&lt;/a&gt; will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are currently only two FDA-approved vaccines that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794995/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; cancer – hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) – and both have been targeted by anti-vaccine activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In January, Trump hosted the launch of Stargate AI at the White House. The project could eventually identify cancers and develop mRNA vaccines in days, Larry Ellison, the chair of the tech company Oracle who is involved with the project, said at the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The project will be funded by private, not federal, dollars, but the work on cancer would draw upon research on cancer and mRNA, among other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; has slashed other critical funding for cancer research, prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration canceled more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/cancer-research-trump-nci-cuts-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$180m in grants&lt;/a&gt; through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the first three months of its term, and proposed cutting $2.7bn from the cancer center in the next NIH budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration has cut back funding for some family planning providers, which frequently offer screenings for HPV and other cancer markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lawmakers have also made enormous cuts to Medicaid and insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could mean uninsured and underinsured people wait longer for cancer treatment – or forgo it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s the potential for great harm, for massive public health issues to be set aside during this really broad approach of canceling research,” said Sasson. “There’s significant harm that’s going to happen by these sweeping changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For scientists who still have funding or those who are entering the field, “there’s tremendous uncertainty as to what the future will look like”, Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But he is optimistic that mRNA vaccines for cancer and other illnesses will be able to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists are often portrayed as “just trying to survive” funding cuts, but that’s not entirely accurate, said Sayour, before adding: “I don’t think many people in my field do this because they’re just trying to survive. I would want nothing more, honest to God, than to put myself out of business. We do this because we want to make a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sayour echoed concerns about both indirect and direct forces shaping progress on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But I also want to be optimistic that our best days are ahead of us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQb3gtVW5FUWM0MzhqU2ViR3RtZHNnNHlPeUFmX3gwSGpZZDZ2b2FFeVlzUW9pWHRmNWlTUS1ac3R4Q3Y4VnZfaGxuYUc1S0Jid05jam1hS2RMa1dBM0hlSlVScUJEWFBaNS1EUjR5VFItU3ViY2o5RVFQQkpDRTRLd3J5R1pRbzQ4TU5jYlpwSGZqVURoMDJVb1dZeV9tdw</guid></item><item><title>一名13岁的孩子胸痛。一种罕见的疾病意味着他“接近心脏性猝死。" - CBS新闻 | A 13-year-old had chest pains.

    &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Brittany Clayborne's 13-year-old son Micah came home from school in December 2023, she asked him if he wanted to play football outside. It was one of his favorite hobbies. But Micah said he couldn't. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'My chest hurts,'" Clayborne recalled. "I was like, 'What do you mean your chest hurts?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words were terrifying to Clayborne, who had a long history of cardiac issues. She gave birth to Micah in 2010. He was born premature, at 34 weeks, and during the delivery, Clayborne had a heart attack. She spent weeks in the cardiac intensive care unit and was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare form of heart failure that happens at the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. During Micah's childhood, her heart continued to weaken. She had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted to maintain her heart rhythm, and a mechanical LVAD pump to help her heart circulate blood. In 2018, she had a heart transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Clayborne's history, Micah had seen a cardiologist regularly as a child. There were never any issues. But Clayborne knew the chest pains could be a warning sign, and she brought him to a cardiologist at 10:30 a.m. the next day. By 11:15 a.m., Micah had been admitted to the cardiac ICU at Children's Medical Center Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests found Micah's heart was functioning at just 7% and that he was "very close to sudden cardiac death," Clayborne said. Just like his mom had, Micah needed a pacemaker and defibrillator. He would eventually need a transplant, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When they tell you that you are going to die, you're like, 'OK, I can fight this,' but when they tell you your child is going to die, that's a whole different set of emotions. Not only are you helpless, you are hopeless," Clayborne said. "And as a person who went through it, knowing what his future looks like, knowing the surgeries that are coming up and what the recovery from those is like, is incredibly difficult to try to explain to your child. It was devastating." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An incredibly rare diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors tested Micah to figure out why a previously healthy teen would be having such severe heart problems. They found that he had Danon disease, a rare genetic condition that affects only about 300 families worldwide. Further testing found that Clayborne also had the condition. The Claybornes are the only documented African-American patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LAMP2 gene cause Danon disease, said Dr. Rakesh Singh, the medical director of the pediatric heart failure and transplantation program at NYU Langone's Hassenfeld Children's Hospital. The gene creates a protein that gets rid of excess waste in the body's cells. The mutation interrupts that process. The inability to get rid of cellular waste causes the heart muscle to thicken, causing the organ to work less efficiently and creating a form of heart failure that "doesn't respond well to medications," Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not uncommon for these children to require heart transplantations in their 20s," Singh explained. Danon disease patients may also have neurological issues or eye problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A long-awaited transplant &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Micah had the pacemaker and defibrillator implanted, he was put on the national waiting list for a heart transplant. In October 2024, Clayborne received the call they had been waiting for. Micah was playing video games when she gave him the news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like 'Yes, this is it, I get a second chance,'" Micah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family headed back to the Children's Medical Center Dallas. As Micah underwent surgery, Clayborne waited nervously. She only became more panicked when she received an update from the transplant team: Micah's heart had been removed, but the new donor heart was still several minutes away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in my brain freaking out. I got out of the waiting room, and I was like, 'I just have to go take a walk.' I wasn't going anywhere specific," Clayborne recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stepped onto the nearest elevator, then held the doors for a man. She saw he was wheeling a container holding a donor heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I looked down and I said 'I think that's my son's heart,'" Clayborne said. "He just kind of smiled at me. Then the doors opened, and he went, fast as he could, straight into the OR. It was this incredibly surreal moment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building a unique support system  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the delivery hiccup, Micah's heart transplant went smoothly. About nine months after the surgery, Micah, now 14, is doing well. He's back in school and receiving regular follow-up care — and focusing on a new passion project.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Micah was awaiting transplant, he had realized how few resources there were for teenagers in his circumstances. There were support groups for parents. There were playgroups for younger kids. Clayborne even asked hospital staff if there were virtual meetings he could join. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt really bad going back in and saying 'Micah, there is no support for you,'" Clayborne said. "And his response was 'I guess we gotta make one.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Micah and Clayborne launched Transplant Teenz, a virtual community aimed at connecting teenagers nationwide while they wait for organ transplants. The non-profit group hosts group meetings and online events and shares educational materials. Dozens have already joined. Micah said he hopes to have 100 participants by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being a teenager is when you're starting to become an adult, and things become more stressful," Micah said. "Transplant just makes everything more stressful without a support group around you. My hope is to give teens a group they can go to that I had never had." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The scan revealed both kidneys were nearly filled with hundreds of tiny stones. "They were packed together like corn kernels," Luc said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The patient, an IT engineer from Phu Tho Province, frequently stayed up late, substituted sugary drinks for water, and led a sedentary lifestyle. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with kidney stones after experiencing abdominal pain and painful urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;However, he neglected treatment and continued his sleeping and dining habits. Recently, he began experiencing prolonged fatigue and was diagnosed with severe kidney failure due to massive stone accumulation. After a provincial hospital refused surgery, he sought treatment at E Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Doctor operating on patient.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Luc said the patient’s poor lifestyle had caused kidney deterioration at a young age. Prolonged sitting and lack of exercise reduced the kidneys' ability to eliminate waste. Sleep deprivation disrupted biological rhythms and impaired blood filtration. Coupled with low water intake, these factors made his urine highly concentrated, creating an ideal environment for crystal formation and stone buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctors performed lithotripsy and extracted hundreds of tiny stones from his kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;This case is not unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Luc once treated an 18-year-old girl whose numerous stones blocked her ureter, causing severe kidney inflammation that Luc described as "almost turning to stone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The girl experienced lower back pain and nausea. Tests confirmed severe nephritis due to ureteral stones obstructing urine flow. Though previously healthy, she had long relied on instant noodles instead of rice, was addicted to milk tea, and rarely drank water. The doctor called this a "toxic combination" for kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;"Instant noodles are high in salt, preservatives, and additives — creating a heavy burden on the kidneys," Luc explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;"Milk tea can also overwork the kidneys due to its high sugar, trans fat, and artificial flavor content," he said, adding that insufficient water intake reduces kidney filtration, allowing mineral residue to accumulate and form stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The U.S. National Library of Medicine noted in a 2018 study that about 1%–19.1% of the Asian population suffer from urolithiasis. The prevalence is 5%–19.1% in West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and some developed countries (South Korea and Japan), but only 1%–8% in most parts of East Asia and North Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;In Vietnam alone, 2–12% of the population are estimated to have urinary stones, with kidney stones accounting for about 40% of these cases. The disease often progresses silently, detected only after complications arise when kidneys may already be severely damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;At a 2023 conference in HCMC, Samuel Vincent G. Yrastorza, President of the ASEAN Federation of Urological Associations, noted that Southeast Asia's geography, tropical climate, genetics, and living conditions contribute to high rates of urological diseases, including kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Speaking at the event, Tran Van Thuan, Deputy Minister of Health, said prostate cancer ranks 11th in Vietnam, with nearly 4,000 new cases, and 13th in mortality rates. This is mostly linked to high-sodium diets, sedentary lifestyles, urinary infections, or metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctors warn that younger individuals now comprise a growing proportion of kidney stone cases. Hospitals have reported patients in their 20s, even children, with kidneys filled with stones. Office workers, gamers, and students cramming for exams who sit all day, eat fast food, and drink sugary beverages instead of water are particularly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Two kidneys clogged with nearly a million stones.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Experts recommend consuming 2–3 liters of water per day to maintain kidney health. Chronic dehydration increases urine concentration, promoting crystal formation and stone development. Additionally, the common habit among office workers of holding in urine allows bacteria to grow, increasing the risk of kidney infection and stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Besides lifestyle factors, urinary tract abnormalities, calcium metabolism disorders, urine pH changes, genetics, hot working environments, and untreated limestone-contaminated water, especially in rural areas, contribute to kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Symptoms of kidney stones often include vague back pain, nausea, painful urination, or blood in urine. Many patients are diagnosed only after stones cause blockages, kidney swelling, fluid retention, or irreversible kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Cao Thi Nhu from the Nephrology and Hemodialysis Center of Hanoi’s Bach Mai Hospital recommended four ways to prevent kidney stones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;- Drink enough water: Aim for 2–3 liters per day, spaced throughout the day. Choose plain water or non-carbonated mineral water. Avoid sugary drinks and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;- Reduce salt intake: Avoid fast food, canned goods, and processed snacks high in sodium. Check food labels and limit sodium intake to under 2,300 mg per day. Use natural seasonings like basil, rosemary, garlic, or chili.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;- Limit animal protein: Reduce red meat and increase plant-based proteins such as beans, legumes, and soy, which also provide fiber and essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall rates have been stable, though certain types of abnormalities are on the rise nationwide, including congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common birth defects among Alaskan babies, according to the 2021 report, were cardiovascular (33 percent) and musculoskeletal (24 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One musculoskeletal defect that has emerged in Alaska is clubfoot, an abnormality that causes a baby's feet to turn inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN), between 2016 and 2020, the rate of clubfoot was reported to be between 2.8 and 3.1 babies per 1,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alaska is the northernmost state in the US, and along with being battered by brutal weather conditions and plunged into almost two months of darkness, it is seeing a rising number of birth defects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the highest rate in the US, where the average is about one in 1,000 births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to March of Dimes, clubfoot prevalence was highest among Alaskans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent, at an average of 4.6 incidences per 1,000 live births between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian and Alaskan Native rates were 3.6 per 1,000 births.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clubfoot, also called talipes equinovarus, occurs when a baby's foot turns inward so much that the bottom of the foot faces sideways or up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It happens because the tendons that connect the muscles to bones in the baby's leg and foot are shorter than they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of babies who have clubfoot have it in both feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although clubfoot is not painful for an infant, treatment is necessary to allow for normal walking and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, a baby will have trouble walking, be susceptible to infections on their feet, have thickened skin on the foot and develop arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment includes physical therapy and in some cases surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But access to rehabilitation in remote communities like those in Alaska can be significantly limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rural Health Information Hub estimates one-third of the state's population - about 240,000 people - live in rural areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this increased prevalence of the particular condition are not fully understood, experts believe that there are several factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The prevalence of birth defects among native children is about 2.5 times higher&lt;span&gt; than among white children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can increase the risk of birth defects (remote Alaskan village of Utqiagvik pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A musculoskeletal defect that has emerged in Alaska is clubfoot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other common birth defects in the state include heart defects, cleft lip and palate, and spina bifida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some research suggests certain gene variations may be more common in Alaskan Native populations, potentially increasing the risk for specific birth defects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These variations don't guarantee the development of a condition, but they do increase susceptibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have also shown maternal smoking can increase birth defect risks, and surveys have revealed a high percentage of women of child-bearing age smoke in Alaska.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can also increase risk levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disposing of hazardous waste in rural areas is often difficult due to remoteness, harsh weather and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, it is sometimes disposed of in ways that allow dangerous chemicals to seep out and into surrounding soil, negatively impacting ecosystems and human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, air pollution and contamination of ground water from manufacturing plants or local businesses can also expose pregnant residents to toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to genetics and toxic waste, alcoholism can play a role the problem that has seemingly plagued these remote parts of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high number of alcohol-related birth defects in remote and rural Alaskan communities have led to the implementation of various measures, including alcohol bans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common alcohol-related birth defects involve the nervous system, heart and skeletal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include conditions like microcephaly - a small head - heart defects and skeletal abnormalities such as radioulnar synostosis, the abnormal connection of the forearm bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Facial abnormalities like cleft lip and palate, and sensory issues such as vision and hearing problems are also frequently observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, Kim said there is an “association between ... excessive alcohol use and heart disease and stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol recommendations vary by person, but, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; considers more than four drinks in one sitting for women or five drinks in one sitting for men to be excessive drinking. More than eight drinks per week for women and 15 drinks per week for men is also considered excessive drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, it’s accepted that women should not have more than one alcoholic drink a day and men should not have more than two, Kim said. These are also the recommendations put forth by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dietary Guidelines for Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore Your Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proper diet is important for managing stroke risk, too. This means moderating foods that are full of saturated fats, sugar and salt, Wang said. (Additionally, Kim pointed out that there is a relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure, which, as we now know, is another stroke risk factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;eat, Kim points to the work of author and journalist &lt;a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michael Pollan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://michaelpollan.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;. This advice is “eat food, mostly plants, not too much,” Wang said. This means having a diet that’s rich in fruits and veggies with some meat added in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismiss Necessary Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since strokes are so common in this country (and this world), it’s important that you’re aware of the signs and get treated as soon as possible. Available stroke treatments work better the sooner they’re done, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because many strokes aren’t painful, and the symptoms of stroke vary so much, it’s important to recognize symptoms of stroke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, there’s a useful acronym to help people remember the signs — and that &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="acronym is FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;acronym is FAST&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said.

Although the differences between liberal and conservative students were small, they were consistent and measurable. However, a follow-up study revealed a striking mismatch between reality and perception: students on campus believed the behavioral divide between liberals and conservatives was far larger than it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aimed to understand whether political differences extend beyond opinions and values to include behavior in everyday, nonpolitical activities. While political polarization is often described in terms of opposing beliefs, the study examined whether liberals and conservatives also live different kinds of lives—and whether others perceive those differences accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really interested in everyday life,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.sanaztalaifar.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sanaz Talaifar&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Imperial College London. “Kenneth Craik has a great quote about the importance of studying the seemingly mundane. He says, ‘Lives are lived day by day, one day at a time, from day to day, day after day, day in day out … lives as we experience and observe them are inherently quotidian.’ I was interested in whether even the mundane, ostensibly non-political stuff of everyday life is politically polarized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also think that we, as researchers, live in really exciting times. The technological advancements that have transformed people’s lives have also transformed how we do research. People always have their smartphones with them, and we can use that fact to collect data about what they’re doing in everyday life with an unprecedented scope and granularity (with their consent, of course). I was really excited about using data collected from smartphones to study the everyday behavior of liberals and conservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two related studies at the University of Texas at Austin. In the first study, they recruited over 1,200 undergraduates to track their daily behaviors over two weeks using a smartphone app. The app collected data from sensors (such as GPS and microphone) and activity logs (including calls and texts) alongside short daily surveys. Students also completed a one-time questionnaire reporting their political orientation and basic demographics. This combination of passive tracking and self-reports allowed the researchers to capture 61 different behaviors in four domains: social activity, physical movement, academic or work-related activity, and leisure time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political orientation was measured on a 7-point scale from “extremely liberal” to “extremely conservative.” The students’ behaviors were then statistically correlated with their political self-placement, with controls in place to account for other possible influences such as gender, ethnicity, personality traits, socioeconomic status, and whether students lived on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite attending the same university and living under similar daily constraints, liberal and conservative students showed subtle but consistent differences in their patterns of behavior. The differences were strongest in the leisure domain. Conservative students, for instance, were more likely to spend time in noisy social environments, attend religious spaces, and be present at fraternities or sororities. They also showed slightly higher rates of physical activity, including walking and commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberal students, on the other hand, tended to spend more time in transit and visited more varied locations, suggesting a more mobile lifestyle. They also spent more time at home and reported higher use of the internet and social media. In the work domain, conservatives were more likely to be studying or attending meetings, while liberals were more likely to report working and spending time with coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some of these differences also showed up at specific times of day or week—for example, liberals were more active in the mornings, while conservatives were more likely to rest during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew from prior research that liberals and conservatives have different cultural and consumer preferences,” Talaifar told PsyPost. “We’ve all heard the stereotypes about liberals drinking lattes and conservatives driving trucks. Maybe some of those differences seem obvious. But I don’t think I appreciated the extent to which everyday behaviors that seemingly have nothing to do with politics or cultural stereotypes could also be polarized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, I don’t think we would necessarily expect those differences when we’re looking at conservatives and liberals who otherwise have so much in common otherwise — they’re all on the same campus, in the same city, roughly the same age, pursuing the same education, and living the same kind of student lifestyle. Even under those conditions, you see that liberals and conservatives behave differently in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These behavioral patterns were small in magnitude but statistically robust. On average, the differences were about the same size as those found between men and women or between different socioeconomic groups in the sample. Most of the associations remained significant even when controlling for potential confounds such as personality traits or religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something we don’t talk about much in the paper is that behavioral differences in everyday life weren’t limited to liberals and conservatives,” Talaifar said. “We found behavioral differences between women and men, upper and lower class students, as well as students of color and white students. So lately I’ve been thinking about how everyday life is bifurcated along all kinds of identity lines, not just political identity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study looked at how students perceived these behavioral differences. A new group of 156 undergraduates was asked to estimate how often liberal or conservative students on their campus engaged in the same 61 behaviors. Their task was to indicate whether they believed liberals or conservatives were more likely to engage in each behavior, or whether there was no difference. The researchers then compared these perceptions to the actual behavioral data from Study 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of Study 2 showed a strong disconnect between perception and reality. Most students significantly overestimated how much liberal and conservative students differed in their daily behaviors. When asked to guess which group did a particular activity more, students were incorrect about three out of every four behaviors. Most of the inaccuracies involved imagining partisan differences that did not exist. For example, students frequently assumed conservatives were more likely to commute, even though the data showed no such difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that students were most accurate when judging leisure behaviors—the domain where real differences were most pronounced. But they were far less accurate in estimating partisan differences in social and work-related behaviors. This suggests that people may be more attuned to visible lifestyle cues, while underestimating—or misunderstanding—less observable daily patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these studies highlight a double layer of polarization: one that exists in behavior, and one that exists in perception. While political identity does shape some aspects of lifestyle, the belief that liberals and conservatives live in completely different worlds is an exaggeration. That misperception may itself contribute to political division. If people assume that those on the other side of the political spectrum live fundamentally different lives, they may be less inclined to interact, cooperate, or empathize with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Liberals and conservatives behave differently in everyday life, but not to the extent that people assume,” Talaifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that lifestyle polarization, even when subtle, can reduce the chances of cross-partisan contact. People who live different kinds of lives—working at different times, visiting different places, socializing in different settings—may have fewer chances to encounter one another. But even more damaging may be the belief that these differences are vast and unbridgeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The behavioral differences were robust and mostly held when we accounted for demographic factors like socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity,” Talaifar noted. “But it’s important to remember that the behavioral differences were small overall. There were many behaviors liberals and conservatives engaged in to a similar degree, and other students on campus generally overestimated the degree to which liberals and conservatives behaved differently in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now building on their findings by exploring how lifestyle polarization may relate to other important outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now we’re looking at whether the behavioral differences we found can explain wellbeing differences between liberals and conservatives,” Talaifar explained. “Prior research generally finds that liberals are unhappier than conservatives, so we’re investigating whether their everyday behaviors can explain that. I’m also &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6mk2a_v1" target="_blank"&gt;working on a project&lt;/a&gt; that maps the everyday behavioral patterns of individuals with authoritarian tendencies using data collected with smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-13129-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lifestyle Polarization on a College Campus: Do Liberals and Conservatives Behave Differently in Everyday Life?&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sanaz Talaifar email the author, Diana Jordan, Samuel D.

"This is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the few years since GLP-1s have &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/bioethics/on-the-increase-in-use-of-glp-1s" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;flooded the market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/mcdonalds-ozempic" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;changed American food consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/diet-industry-ozempic-meltdown" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;utterly upended the weight loss industry&lt;/a&gt;, a handful of studies have looked into some of their scarier side effects — and their results aren't exactly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Harvard researchers &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-ozempic-linked-condition-blindness" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;revealed a troubling link&lt;/a&gt; between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a condition that blocks blood flow to the eyes and can cause blindness. In that study, people with diabetes who take semaglutide were found to be four times more likely to develop NAION than the average person — and although there are &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/experts-criticize-ozempic-blindness-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;some complicating factors&lt;/a&gt;, that's nothing to scoff at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1070623" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;doctors at Washington University in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who take GLP-1s have increased rates of kidney problems and pancreatitis — a disorder that the United Kingdom's medical regulator has, separately, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-glp-1-illnesses-deaths" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;begun investigating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-arthritis-study-success" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;tons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-alcohol-drug-addiction" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/glp-1-ozempic-benefits-map" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;constellation of health benefits&lt;/a&gt; these drugs can have &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-opioid-overdose" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;outside of weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, there hasn't been as much research into their of adverse effects&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and what's already out there might not represent the full population of people who take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though women make up an estimated 65 percent of GLP-1 users in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.realchemistry.com/article/states-with-highest-rates-of-glp-1-use" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;per the healthcare market analysis group Real Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, there have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8950819/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;only been&lt;/a&gt; a few studies that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/166/2/bqae165/7931638" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;take into account&lt;/a&gt; how &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819958/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;different genders respond&lt;/a&gt; to the drugs. According to Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist from the University of Calgary in Canada, that's a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need studies which include women," Skibicka told &lt;em&gt;DW&lt;/em&gt;. "Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still [in] most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Canadian neuroendocrinologist still believes that the "list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks," doctors and patients alike need to be able to make that cost-benefit analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without sufficient study into risks, that analysis is skewed in the favor of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/21/ozempic-wegovy-diabetes-weight-spending/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;high-grossing drug manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; — which is bad news for the people who may bear the brunt of these potentially serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on Ozempic: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-inventor-generic-fee" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something Comically Bad Just Happened to the Inventor of Ozempic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 10:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFA4VVR1SXhzeDZLU3dINjdhSWdrZ25fMk9UMUtiVHVsRkZDWVB2cUEzTE95RnozUURCa3IzeGliTE0yRFpUSHZhaUhJR1Q1Q2lEZENSY1pDX3ZxQ3RvZWtlZVpRQmVJLUwtVVE</guid></item><item><title>10种可能在您不知情的情况下导致肾损伤的日常习惯-印度时报 | 10 Everyday habits that could lead to kidney damage without you knowing - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kidneys are essential for filtering waste, balancing body fluids, and managing blood pressure—yet they’re often overlooked in daily health routines. Surprisingly, many common lifestyle habits may be silently damaging these vital organs over time. From overusing painkillers to eating too much salt or processed food, even seemingly harmless choices can strain your kidneys. Add in poor hydration, lack of sleep, or excessive protein, and the risks multiply. Fortunately, small, conscious changes can make a big difference. According to the National Kidney Foundation, here are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;10 everyday habits that may contribute to kidney damage &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;and offer practical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;tips to protect and support long-term kidney health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;before problems become irreversible or harder to manage later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kidney damage can start with these daily habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overusing painkillers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin are widely used to ease aches, inflammation, or fever. But frequent or high-dose use—especially without medical guidance—can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and potentially lead to long-term damage. This risk is even higher for people already living with kidney disease. To protect your kidneys, use NSAIDs sparingly and never exceed the recommended dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;'Awareness is the Key to Healthy Kidneys': Expert's Vital Message on World Kidney Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eating too much salt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sodium is a known contributor to high blood pressure, one of the leading causes of kidney damage. Most of this salt doesn’t come from the salt shaker but from processed and packaged foods. Over time, high sodium levels can strain kidney function. Try seasoning meals with herbs, lemon juice, or garlic to reduce your salt intake without sacrificing flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you prioritize drinking enough water daily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consuming too many processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study revealed that diets heavy in ultra-processed foods can increase the risk of chronic kidney disease by 24%. These foods are high in sodium, unhealthy fats, added sugars, and chemical additives—yet low in fiber and essential nutrients. Swap them out for whole foods like fresh vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains to support kidney and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Not drinking enough water&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water helps your kidneys remove toxins through urine. Dehydration, especially during intense activity or hot weather, can lead to kidney stones or impair how well your kidneys filter waste. While those with late-stage kidney disease may need to limit fluid intake, most people should aim for 6 to 8 glasses of water a day. Always consult your doctor to determine what’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skimping on sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kidneys, like the rest of your body, follow a daily rhythm. Sleep regulates hormones that affect kidney function and fluid balance. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to higher risks of high blood pressure and kidney problems. Prioritize 7–8 hours of quality sleep each night to give your kidneys time to recover and regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eating too much protein&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for health, but excessive consumption—especially from red meat—can put extra stress on your kidneys. Animal proteins produce waste products that kidneys must filter out. In people with pre-existing kidney conditions, this burden can accelerate damage. Opt for lean proteins like fish or plant-based alternatives, and talk to your healthcare provider about how much protein is appropriate for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overindulging in sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming too much sugar can lead to weight gain, obesity, and eventually diabetes—all of which increase your risk of kidney disease. Added sugars are found not just in sweets but in seemingly healthy foods like flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, and sauces. Reading nutrition labels and cutting back on sugary drinks and snacks can help safeguard your kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smoking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking doesn’t just harm your lungs and heart—it also affects your kidneys. Nicotine can impair blood flow and damage kidney tissue. Additionally, smokers are more likely to have protein in their urine, a marker of kidney damage. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk and improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking too much alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy alcohol consumption disrupts how kidneys regulate fluid and electrolytes in your body. It can also dehydrate you, increase blood pressure, and worsen liver health—making your kidneys work harder. Moderate drinking is generally considered one drink per day for women and two for men. Anything beyond that may raise your risk of kidney and liver complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Living a sedentary lifestyle&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of physical activity is linked to weight gain, poor circulation, and higher blood pressure—all of which can negatively impact kidney health. Regular exercise helps manage weight and cholesterol and improves heart and kidney function. Even light activities like walking, stretching, or yoga can benefit your kidneys when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key lifestyle habits that can prevent kidney damage naturally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay well-hydrated: &lt;/strong&gt;Drinking enough water helps your kidneys flush out waste and prevent kidney stones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more whole foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and home-cooked meals instead of processed or salty foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit salt and sugar intake: &lt;/strong&gt;Reducing sodium and added sugars can help control blood pressure and lower your risk of diabetes—both major causes of kidney disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of medications: &lt;/strong&gt;Avoid overusing NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) and always follow dosage instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise quality sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Your kidneys rely on a regular sleep-wake cycle to function efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular exercise helps regulate blood pressure, manage weight, and improve overall kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor protein consumption: &lt;/strong&gt;While protein is important, too much—especially from animal sources—can burden your kidneys, especially if you already have kidney concerns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking and limit alcohol: &lt;/strong&gt;Smoking reduces blood flow to your kidneys; excessive alcohol can dehydrate and strain them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular checkups: &lt;/strong&gt;Especially if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a family history of kidney issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-superfood-could-be-the-cheapest-way-to-eat-healthier-and-its-already-in-your-kitchen/articleshow/122363684.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;This superfood could be the cheapest way to eat healthier and it’s already in your kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>私人教练说，如果你经常走路，你应该经常做这三个练习- Fit&amp;Well | A personal trainer says these are the three exercises you should be doing regularly if you walk a lot - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPcTU1TVp5Q3M5VGg0bWxLelNqS2ZkZlRWd2FnWnJKMDNMeWl4NXZiUzUwTjdPcy1aa3E4X1BMejRyUE1WbGxyMzExWkV6SDZPTmQzclVWTE1YOHM4NVpOckhTVVpJUnRUODl2eHlNMWRzRy1ISU1zWXBHMi1TbldHdl9tVWFHcXB1YnFMZDNtbWxOWkFWYUhxV0dvLXRjeU12cjlTUXExblI4QW9taEZibGNxNEJPaDNBVmdKdmU1RXBvUGxKd3JZeUxLWjlNaEI4TG9aZ2VubV9qUnVHUEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking might seem like a simple way to work out but it’s one of the best things you can do for your body. If you’re new to walking it’s worth being aware of the muscles it engages and how you can keep them strong, supple and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is one of the most underrated forms of movement,” says Alo Moves' head trainer for Los Angeles, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=fitandwell_gb_7594978304975648596&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alomoves.com/instructors/louis-chandler" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="alomoves.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Louis Chandler&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s low-impact, accessible and incredibly effective for maintaining overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also enhances body awareness by reinforcing good posture, stride mechanics and mindful movement, which are all essential for joint health and injury prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can be surprisingly effective at helping you build strength, tone and endurance in your muscles, despite being low-impact. And because many people can sustain walking longer than running, it can also mean burning more calories over time, especially if you’re just starting with fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, walking builds endurance and resiliency that support healthy aging both inside and outside the gym,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a balance perspective, walking requires coordination and weight shifting from one side of the body to the other, which strengthens stabilizing muscles and helps prevent falls as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Chandler what we should all be doing to support our walking muscles, and he gave me his top three exercises to stretch and strengthen the lower body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells, but you can also use filled water bottles or a backpack in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-calf-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Calf stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2-3&lt;strong&gt; Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;20-30sec each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a wall with your palms pressed into the wall at shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place your toes on the wall, keeping your heel on the floor and leg straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean gently into the wall until you feel a stretch in the calf of your back leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Tight calves can negatively affect your gait mechanics and may contribute to discomfort in the knees or lower back,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keeping your calves flexible helps maintain a smooth, balanced stride, allowing you to walk longer distances comfortably and efficiently. Stretching the calves regularly also supports ankle mobility, which is key for stability during walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-romanian-deadlift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Romanian deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;: 2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;: 8-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart with a slight bend in your knees holding dumbbells, or a kettlebell or barbell in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your back flat and core engaged, hinge at the hips, pushing your hips back, to lower the weight, keeping it close to your legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then push your hips forward to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the movement slow and controlled throughout, and avoid rounding your back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Romanian deadlifts [RDLs] are excellent for strengthening the hamstrings and glutes, which are the primary muscles that drive powerful, efficient steps,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening these muscles improves your walking speed and stamina, while helping to reduce fatigue during longer distances. Additionally, RDLs reinforce the hip hinge movement pattern, which is essential for protecting your lower back and promoting healthy posture as you move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-weighted-march"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Weighted march&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps: &lt;/strong&gt;10-12 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand holding weights by your sides and engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee to hip height while keeping your spine upright and shoulders back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your foot and repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue alternating legs, marching in place with control and balance, engaging your hips and core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Kettlebell marches are a dynamic exercise that improves core stability, balance and coordination,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these elements are crucial for maintaining a strong, efficient walking gait. Because this movement mimics the natural gait cycle while adding resistance, you’re training your body to walk better under load. This helps build endurance and control, reducing fatigue and improving overall walking performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your knees tend to cave in during squats or split squats, there could be an often-overlooked culprit: a weak gluteus medius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;gluteus medius&lt;/a&gt; is one of three big muscles in your buttocks, sitting at the side of your hip. It helps to stabilize your pelvis, hips and legs, especially during weight-bearing movements like squats, lunges and even walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s weak, your body compensates and may result in poor movement patterns that can cause your knees to cave in. Physical therapist and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://squatuniversity.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://squatuniversity.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; Squat University&lt;/a&gt; founder Dr. Aaron Horschig highlighted this in a recent post on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the side of your hip lies a small muscle called your glute medius that helps stabilize your pelvis and leg. If it’s not working well your knees can cave, your pelvis can drop and the rest of your body can feel the effects,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horschig recommends doing a clamshell in a side plank position to both strengthen and activate this muscle. This variation, he explains, helps the gluteus medius stay contracted throughout the move, improving pelvic and hip stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about other ways to build strength in this area so I spoke to clinical exercise physiologist and orthopedic surgeon &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.myobesityteam.com/writers/6835c45e8e89dba722d93ad5" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.myobesityteam.com/writers/6835c45e8e89dba722d93ad5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jerome Enad&lt;/a&gt;. He explained more about the importance of the gluteus medius and recommended three exercises to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-a-strong-gluteus-medius-improve-squat-technique"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How does a strong gluteus medius improve squat technique?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gluteus medius helps maintain proper alignment of the pelvis, but weak or injured hips can cause issues with balance and coordination,” says Enad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jjm7ekZzK9Tb2P5PR9jNUX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jjm7ekZzK9Tb2P5PR9jNUX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A condition known as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Trendelenburg_Gait" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Trendelenburg_Gait" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Trendlenburg gait&lt;/a&gt; can develop. This is when the weak gluteus medius can’t hold the pelvis level when standing on the weaker side, so it drops on the opposite side during walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like when you carry a heavy backpack on just one shoulder, causing you to be lopsided. Similarly, if a person with a weak gluteus medius is doing squats, the compensation that occurs while standing on both feet is a type of lean that may look like your knee is caving in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends trying these three moves to strengthen the gluteus medius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-single-leg-deadlift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Single-leg deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From standing, shift your weight onto your right foot, bending your right knee slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean forward, hinging at your hips while lifting your left leg behind you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push your hips forward to slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do all your reps on one side, then switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it harder:&lt;/strong&gt; hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-clamshell"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Clamshell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your side with your knees bent at 90° and one knee on top of the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise the top knee while keeping your feet together. Avoid moving your pelvis or tilting backward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower the knee back down with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Place a short-loop resistance band around the knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-banded-lateral-walk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

If you’re working in a small space, move back and forth in space available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Choose a band which offers more resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROGERS, Ark. — A simple camping trip at Beaver Lake has turned into weeks of treatments for a Northwest Arkansas man who was bitten by a bat.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Cash was camping with his family at the lake on July 2 when he said a bat flew out of nowhere and bit him.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was getting close to dark out, and the kids were swimming, and I was sitting there in a chair, watching them swim, and then this bat flew out of nowhere and just bit me on the leg, and then just kept flying out over the lake," Cash recalled. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't long after and Cash was headed to the hospital. While he wasn't sure the bat had rabies, he knew he had to play it safe and start getting treated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I knew that bats carry rabies oftentimes, especially if they, you know, come at you unprovoked," Cash explained. "I decided to go in straight to the hospital and start getting the rabies vaccine going."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night he received four injections while at the emergency room, one in each limb. This was just the start of his rabies treatment, which has included additional jabs the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash said he's doing fine, and those close to him are already cracking jokes about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been okay. You know, a lot of people have been making jokes about, turning into Batman or whatever... but it's all in good fun. I'm doing fine. I haven't had any issues, you know, other than just the inconvenience," Cash said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amrit Khalsa practices family medicine at Mercy Fort Smith. She said that's exactly what anyone should do if they ever have a similar encounter.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first thing, if you've been bitten, is you want to one seek medical attention immediately. Once you've done that, you've established that you're going to go to the hospital, contacted your doctor or your provider, then you want to take a look at where you got bit, and you want to thoroughly cleanse the wound. Usually that means soap and water," Dr. Khalsa said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Khalsa added that sometimes it's hard to tell if the animal bit you was rabid.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes doctors will ask questions about whether the animal that bit you was provoked. What was the behavior of the animal right before it bit you? Sometimes that can provide a little bit more information as to whether the animal was rabid," Khalsa said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Khalsa said it's a matter of getting treated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first part is they give you the rabies vaccines. It's a series of vaccines that you would need to return to get which gives you protection. It takes time for your body to make the antibodies against that virus that will protect you from the virus if it's starting to take hold in the body," Dr. Khalsa said. "The second part is immunoglobulin. What that is, is that it helps to prevent infection immediately."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash said he's gone through part of that treatment so far.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had to do four the first day, and then July 5 was five, and then July 9 was six. And then I have to do it again on the 16th... so it'll be total of seven, you know, overall," Cash said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Khalsa said it's very important to get treated right away to avoid getting encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is a phase where you can get an inflammation of your brain lining, and that's when it gets really serious in terms of your symptoms, because you develop the classic hydrophobia, or fear of water, you can get spasms of your throat, known as pharyngeal spasms, and leading to, you know, coma and then eventually asphyxiation, leading to death."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
