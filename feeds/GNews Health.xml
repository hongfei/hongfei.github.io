But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELdIBtgFBVV95cUxNT3ZwUlhKTHhXMGJqVDVwSmZGbC1YZXNVSHRqaW56SVFNbEF5dTJYeEp4bTFjSDE4LUk5eTFqSEsxellJY2tqalNndTl3Y1lNSE5tbkVUOU5aMHljMld6NUYxQ1JqLUhFTVUwcHZONElDb282dWtweFdWLXo5bzVyUXlsRS1xNDI5RnZ3ZUVUQXdWNHVKRnlxUmhaTFJTd1VYOHhlSVR3ZEROa2FXQzVoR0xoX1E4dw</guid></item><item><title>人类“超级免疫力” –被蛇咬超过100次的男人有助于创造革命性的抗蛇毒血清- SciTechDaily | Human “Super Immunity” – Man Bitten by Snakes Over 100 Times Helps Create Revolutionary Antivenom - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR</guid></item><item><title>胡子真的比马桶座更脏吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | Are beards really dirtier than toilet seats? - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNb1FpSGhkN2lXT2hhejFtdGw3clZoVXc2TWZ5SFgybGxjSk1NdmgzZkNKeTFRMDV0VG1ZRE03RWkwUTU4YVJUc0JvaTA2RTgxNVVyTXlVQklUd2lDdnpDUzdQekQ1cng2YURaUm1XbUlXX0JRQ1ZDd1UxT1UzUFVTMQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="SUGNOIWZKFBXJL2YFC4WAEXP44" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="SUGNOIWZKFBXJL2YFC4WAEXP44" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The question:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2EBHUJV6CZCLBER4BJKKDXHFGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is it true that beards are dirtier than toilets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="U7MNJOOAXVA7FLYHIOMJOFBR4Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="U7MNJOOAXVA7FLYHIOMJOFBR4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The science:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FNEGGDW6NH6JD4EAQEAGCE5Z4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No need to reach for the razor just yet.

Surgical masks help protect patients from potential bacteria and other microorganisms from health-care workers’ noses and mouths.

In contrast, disliked vegetables like beets or sprouts are typically rejected due to distaste, an aversion based on taste or texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that meat rejection involves deeper psychological and evolutionary mechanisms, possibly linked to avoiding pathogens. Researchers believe this emotional response strengthens with intentional meat avoidance, such as during Veganuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust vs. Distaste:&lt;/strong&gt; Meat is rejected with disgust, while vegetables are rejected due to distaste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathogen Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; Disgust toward meat may have evolved to help humans avoid disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior Reinforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; The disgust response can strengthen with deliberate meat avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many vegetarians who reject meat feel disgust which closely matches the aversion others feel to the idea of eating human flesh, feces or dog meat, new research has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by the University of Exeter set out to investigate whether there is a difference in the psychological mechanisms by which people reject meat compared to vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an online study involving 300 people (mostly vegetarians), researchers found that people who reject vegetables they dislike do so because they feel ‘distaste’ – a simple aversion to taste, texture, or smell of a food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when people dislike and reject meat that would be considered appetising by omnivores (such as roast chicken or beef steak), they feel the more complex emotion disgust, in a similar way that meat-eaters were disgusted by the idea of eating human meat, feces, or dog meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Natalia Lawrence, of the University of Exeter said: “This is the most robust evidence to date that we reject meat and vegetables that we find repellent based on different underlying processes. Obviously finding meat disgusting can help people avoid eating it, which has health and environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we’ve conducted suggests that these feelings of disgust may develop when people deliberately reduce or avoid eating meat, such as during Veganuary ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Appetite,&lt;/em&gt; recruited 252 people who reject meat and 57 omnivores who eat meat. Researchers tested responses to images of 11 different substances (palatable meat; vegetables which are commonly disliked, such olives, sprouts, raw aubergine, and beetroot. Participants were asked several questions about how eating each of the foods would make them feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each question was linked to either disgust (e.g. ‘&lt;em&gt;I would dislike any dish which contained even the tiniest amount of this food, even if I could not taste, smell, feel, or see it.’&lt;/em&gt;) or distaste (e.g. ’&lt;em&gt;I would dislike the taste, smell, or texture of this food.’&lt;/em&gt;) which allowed the researchers to make a distinction between what people felt (disgust or distaste) when they rejected different foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare reactions, the meat-eating participants were also shown images of substances which everyone considers disgusting to eat: human flesh, dog meat and faeces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded 557 rejections of meat (up to three rejections from 252 people), and 670 rejections of vegetables (up to 2 rejections each from 309 people). Where participants said they would not eat the item pictured, they completed questions to investigate the grounds for rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently, people rejected vegetables they did not like based on distaste, and rejected meat and disgust elicitors in a strikingly similar disgust pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Elisa Becker, who conducted the work at the University of Exeter and has since moved to Oxford University, said: “Meat eaters responded to the idea of eating these truly disgusting substances like faeces in the same way that vegetarians responded to images of meat that they didn’t want to eat, and this was very different from the way they responded to vegetables they rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we may think we’re rejecting a food simply because we don’t want to eat it, we showed that the basis for this rejection is quite different – and we think that’s evolved to protect us from pathogens that can lie undetected in meat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this food aversion and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f282809781819d94949b9197b2978a97869780dc9391dc8799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2025.108033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalia Lawrence et al. &lt;em&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may reject foods due to distaste (an affective reaction to undesirable sensory properties) or disgust (an emotive response to the idea of what a food represents). Disgust can further be classified into sub-types: core, animal-reminder, and moral disgust, all of which could influence food rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research suggests different rejection mechanisms for plant and animal foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested this in an online study in a meat-rejecting sample (mostly vegetarians, n = 252), and a meat-accepting sample (omnivores, n = 57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants rated foods they rejected for consumption on criteria related to distaste (e.g. objection to taste), general disgust (e.g. contamination potential of the food), and specific disgust sub-types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings across these criteria created unique response profiles for commonly disliked vegetables, meats, universal disgust elicitors, and accepted food (control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual inspection of response profiles, correlations, and a multidimensional scaling analysis all revealed that plant foods were rejected based on distaste, whereas rejection responses to palatable meat closely matched responses to human meat, faeces, and dog meat (disgust elicitors), both rejected based on disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspecting disgust response profiles suggested that core disgust was the primary disgust type, with animal-reminder and moral disgust sometimes experienced in addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study confirms differential rejection mechanisms for plant-based foods (rejected via distaste) and meat (core disgust).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests different evolutionary strategies humans had to adapt to cope with plant toxins detectable through distaste and pathogens found in meat not detectable by taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such adaptations could be leveraged in future interventions to reduce meat consumption or increase vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:42:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DcjZsYzBfb3pfTktCWjBpckNPcmEzaHdBOFdldlhvSGc3dFNoeXMtNC1VSmJqdVh4c1NVSEluTkttM2p2eVJ4Uk82UjBnR0J6UThGSEhSWHgwb3JRV0JuajZJSDkxcHBxdHZqbW5INA</guid></item><item><title>他在56小时的手术中接受了别人的脸的礼物。接下来发生的事情很复杂-《独立报》 | He received the gift of someone else’s face in a 56-hour surgery.

It was the duration: the surgery had taken 56 hours — far longer than he’d expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talked about 36 hours,” he recalls, “so I was shocked.” He couldn’t imagine the drama that had played out in the operating room while surgeons worked against the clock to remove his existing deformities and then transfer another man’s face onto his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness had trained for years for this moment, lifting weights and doing dips and cardio so that his body would be strong enough to undergo such an extensive surgery. And yet, it would be months before he had the strength to hold a conversation without tiring, years before he felt at home in his own skin. The complications that had arisen during his operation were nail-biting. The plastic surgeon who led the operation, Dr. Samir Mardini, had tried to take a short break during those 56 hours that Andy was under, but with the adrenaline pumping and the scenes running through his mind, he found that he couldn’t switch off — so he went straight back down to theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness, now in his late thirties, remains one of only a few people in the world to have received a full face transplant. In 2006, at age 21, he attempted to take his own life with a rifle shot to the face. He survived, barely. The damage was devastating. For a decade he lived with a face that had been reconstructed, piece by piece, in a series of surgeries — functional, but far from natural. Children would point at him in the street or ask their parents what they were looking at. Adults would widen their eyes then quickly look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 eeQqqU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Andy Sandness (right, with Dr Samir Mardini who led the 56-hour surgery) has married and had children since the face transplant.

That milestone belongs to Isabelle Dinoire, a French woman mauled by her dog in 2005. But Sandness’s surgery, performed in 2016 at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, marked a quiet milestone in the American history of facial transplantation: a pivot from possibility to permanence. It was a test case not just of surgical technique, but of ethics, identity, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini says the team trained for over three years before they even had a recipient. Fifty weekends were spent in the cadaver lab with doctors, nurses and even medical photographers, painstakingly transferring the faces of dead people onto the bones of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as they prepared, they didn’t know if their efforts would come to anything. A face is not like a singular organ, where the tissue is all the same and the major veins and arteries are obvious. A face has skin; muscular tissue; parts of bone; tiny blood vessels; nerve pathways crucial for touch, sight, and the ability to swallow and eat. Eyelids, nostrils and lips come in certain sizes. Hairlines have to match up. Skin color and tone needs to be close to the recipient’s. All of these factors mean that finding a match on the donor list is close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, not far away in rural Minnesota, 21-year-old Rudy Ross compulsively took his life in earshot of his wife, Lilly, following an argument. Lilly called an ambulance immediately, but it was clear that Rudy could not be saved. What made Rudy’s death so tragic is abundantly clear — he was young and healthy, with his whole life ahead of him and no history of major disease — but it’s also what made him an ideal candidate for organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Race Against Two Clocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Rudy Ross’s body arrived at Mayo Clinic, everything was in motion. Gravely sick people who had been waiting at the top of the transplant list across the country were told that the organ they needed was on the way. In these kinds of situations, a kidney can be headed to Alaska while a liver is earmarked for Texas and a heart is needed in Pennsylvania. Each hospital sends a team to take the organ back to their waiting recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you add face transplantation into this mix, things get complicated. Rudy’s wife had been suddenly widowed. She was eight months’ pregnant. And while Rudy had agreed to donate his internal organs by ticking the requisite boxes on his drivers’ license, his face had never been promised. That had to be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families who “might be approached by the organ procurement organization to talk about the face” are usually those who already know their loved one wanted their internal organs to be given, says Dr. Mardini. “So there’s already a sort of open discussion… Your loved one has signed off on their drivers’ license that they would like to give the gift of heart donation, lung donation, kidney donation — but we have a patient at Mayo Clinic that is in need of a face. Is this something you would consider?” That topic is introduced only if the donor is a clear match, which was clearly the case for Rudy and Andy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got chills,” says Dr. Mardini, recalling how he felt when he saw Rudy’s face. The two men “could have been cousins.” After a difficult period of reflection, Lilly agreed that her late husband’s face, as well as his internal organs, could be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 IDsGF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Two side-by-side operating theaters were set up over the weekend for the face donation and transplantation.

The surgery began on Friday and continued until Monday morning&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two operations were required to be undertaken at the same time in order to transplant Rudy’s face onto Andy, and Mardini was in charge of both. The two men were placed in side-by-side operating theaters — Rudy, braindead but stabilized, and Andy, anesthetized and closely watched — and Mardini carefully removed Rudy’s face before running it into the adjoining theater and attaching it to Andy’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully removing all of the tissue surrounding the face is delicate. And preparing the recipient to receive all those veins, nerves and muscles is a procedure in itself, one that borders on the horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy’s was a significant surgery in that it involved the entire upper jaw, lower jaw, the cheekbones, the mandible and the nose and teeth and all the overlying structures,” says Mardini. “So you're talking about the nose and then lower eyelid and below, and then deep from the skin all the way down to the bone. You need to remove everything that's remaining there. That's to accommodate the donor to come in. So you're at the end of it, and you're staring at the greater vessels, the carotid and the jugular. You're staring at the tongue and the eyeballs, and everything else is gone.” It’s something that he and the rest of the team had to prepare for, not just in terms of “the technical part, but the emotional and mental part.” No one is used to seeing a living human without a face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that all this work has to be done to remove the underlying tissues also means that the operation is extremely high-pressured. There’s no going back in a face transplant, no putting the old organ back in and trying again next week with something else. Failure is quite simply catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack El Hai is an author who spent five years with Andy Sandness and his medical team, and was in the operating theater as the pioneering surgery was performed. He got to know the process intimately and interviewed multiple members of the medical team as it had happened. He remembers a moment where things got particularly tense in the operating room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a moment in the placement of the donor's face onto Andy when an important blood vessel narrowed or collapsed or went into spasms,” he says. “And it took a long time — or it seemed like forever, it was probably just a matter of minutes — but it took a while for the surgical team to figure out what was going on and why, and how to fix it. They noticed that while that blood vessel was constricting, Andy's face went white. It was obvious it wasn't getting proper blood flow. And that had to be fixed immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team struggled to work out what was happening, El Hai felt the mood in the room shift. Andy’s old, reconstructed face had been cut away. There wasn’t really a Plan B, beyond “a gaping opening in his face that somehow would've had to be patched using skin from other parts of his body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Painful Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another issue with taking a face from a donor who also has healthy organs that are waiting to be procured for other people in dire health situations: “The way it works best is to have the face donation go first,” says Dr. Mardini. “And that makes it very tricky, because you're dealing with a ‘life-giving’ operation versus a ‘life-saving’ operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, only around 50 face transplants have ever been performed. The rarity isn’t due to a lack of demand. Patients with devastating facial injuries — most often from trauma, cancer, or infection — face profound physical and social barriers. A functioning face is not just about appearance; it governs speech, eating, blinking, and expressing emotion. Traditional reconstructive surgery can require dozens of procedures and still fall short of restoring those functions. A transplant offers, in some cases, a faster route to a more complete face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the barriers are steep. These operations require staggering surgical precision: connecting those nerves, blood vessels, and bone with millimeter-level accuracy. Then there’s the immunological gauntlet. Patients must commit to a lifetime of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection — medications that can cause serious side effects, from kidney damage to cancer. Isabelle Dinoire died of a cancer related to low immunity 11 years after her own partial face transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo’s team had to prove to the organ procurement organization — and to their peers — that their procedure wasn’t a vanity project. It was an operation that could restore breathing, eating, speaking, the ability for a person to live a normal life. It was reconstructive and transformative, not simply cosmetic. Still, the optics were fragile. There was no precedence in the U.S. for prioritizing a face over a lung. And the team also had to convince their own hospital that Andy Sandness, a man who had previously attempted suicide, would work hard to make the transplant worth it, complying with a regimen of immunosuppressant drugs throughout his life and continuing the work he’d put in for years previously. That meant psychiatric assessments and social workers on top of all the other medical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different organs have different rates of depreciation, but all have a small amount of time when they remain viable after death. Keeping Rudy Ross stable enough that those other organs stayed healthy was a huge undertaking in itself. Ordinarily, the heart and lungs need to be taken within four to six hours of death, the liver within eight to twelve, and the kidneys within 24 to 36, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.donoralliance.org/newsroom/donation-essentials/what-is-the-time-frame-for-transplanting-organs/"&gt;according to the nonprofit Donor Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the face from Rudy “took longer, I think, than [Mardini] expected, more than 20 hours,” says Jack El Hai, “meaning there were other surgeons waiting in the wings to remove the other organs that the donor had given permission for them to take, and it got tense. They were getting impatient. They were worried about the health of those organs that they were waiting for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 efPIYE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="When Andy woke from the surgery, he didn't have functionality in his new face.

He had also assembled an in-house team to remove the organs immediately if Rudy Ross destabilized, who were ready to step in at a second’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the surgery was long and delicate, it worked out in the end. Rudy’s organs went on to save the lives of a number of desperate people, something that was especially important to his widow, Lilly. The details surrounding exactly how many organs were taken have not been released, to protect the privacy of the patients who received them. However, we do know that no organ was compromised by the face transplantation going ahead. That, in itself, is close to a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s Left Behind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miracles in medicine are earned, not bestowed. And Mardini’s team had worked hard to earn theirs: during their weekends in the cadaver lab, they had transferred the biggest possible face onto the smallest possible skull and vice versa; they did CAT scans and drew complex plans of bone and blood vessels in the way an architectural team might put together plans of concrete structures and plumbing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new story began for Andy Sandness when he woke up with Rudy Ross’s face. But first, Ross’s story had to come to a dignified close. Four years earlier, an expert team in developing silicone facial prosthetics had agreed to come down to the cadaver lab sessions and learn how to construct a mask of an entire face. The team had previously made lifelike prosthetic noses, eyes and ears for people with deformities or serious injuries; in the lab, they molded masks that were indistinguishable from the original faces, “with the freckles and the wrinkles and the hair,” says Mardini. Once Rudy Ross’s body arrived at the clinic, they were called in to do the job they’d trained for over a number of years. Fourteen delicate layers of material were carefully woven together and shaped, in order that his body could return to the funeral home looking recognizable, in a process that took 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly Ross had planned for a closed casket funeral after she’d agreed to her husband’s face to be transplanted onto Andy Sandness. But when the Mayo Clinic released Rudy’s body, complete with silicone mask, Mardini says they received a call from the funeral director: “He kind of paused then said: ‘I think you sent me the wrong body, because there was going to be a face donation’. And when it turned out it wasn’t the wrong body, he called up the wife and the mom and said: ‘You might want to come and visit with the body’. And they did an open casket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking Like Yourself, As Someone Else&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he has Rudy Ross’s face, Andy Sandness doesn’t look like his donor. That’s because one’s underlying bone structure is just as important for how a person’s face looks as the individual components. That was a relief for Rudy’s widow Lilly — who met with Andy a few times, although they eventually lost touch as they both moved on and had further families — and for Rudy’s mother, who Andy stayed in touch with until her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy is one of the rare people in human existence who has had three faces during his life,” says Jack El Hai. “The one he was born with, the reconstructed face, and then the transplanted face.” Such huge aesthetic changes can be a shock to the system, and psychological issues with carrying someone else’s face or limbs have led to people requesting removal in the past. “So the social workers and the psychologists led him through what they called a gradual reveal,” El Hai continues, “which meant seeing pieces, portions of his face in the mirror, a bit at a time, gradually, from a distance and up close. And this helped Andy become reconciled to his new appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 bNCEqj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-17996"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of Mayo Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Hai’s opinion, Andy — who he describes as a thoughtful and quiet man who came out of his shell after the face transplant — “looks great” these days. “I always tell people that I think he looks like Matt Damon,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness remains a private man, however, who prefers to do media interviews over email rather than in person or over the phone. Eight years after the surgery, functionality, he says, is good. He’s legally blind in his left eye but has some peripheral vision. “My nerves and feeling in my face improve daily,” he says. “But there is more I could do as far as exercises to improve what I have.” His progress has been steady but incremental, often invisible to outsiders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal work has required just as much effort as the external. When I ask him what’s overlooked about his experience, he says it’s a “complicated” question, because at first he thought he should mention the time and dedication from everyone involved that goes into a face transplant. “But the more I think about it, it’s definitely not repeating suicide to my friends, family, and doctors,” he says. When he woke up after attempting to take his own life, “I was embarrassed, humiliated, and depressed.” Over the years, he’s accrued a whole team “of psychiatrists, psychologists, and family and friends that all believed in me,” and that’s been humbling. He keeps in mind that he would never want to let them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a hard shell but a big heart,” he continues. “I will go out of my way to help people out. But I will never ask for help in return, even when I know I need it. I’m stubborn as a mule and do things how I see fit.” It’s a mentality that may have led him to suicidality when he was younger. But it’s also a mentality that he believes helped him pre-transplant: he kept going, even in circumstances many would have found unbearable. Asked if he’s an organ donor himself, he replies simply: “Of course I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini never thought he’d perform such a complex operation as a plastic surgeon. But the change in Andy Sandness’s life is clear: “He is able to swim. He is able to eat and drink in a restaurant. He is able to interact normally with people,” he says. Recently, Andy described a quiet moment that signaled, to Mardini, that he and his medical team had achieved everything they’d wanted to when they first set out, years prior, to perform the pioneering transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When he walked in an elevator, this kid and his mom walked in after him,” Mardini recalls. “The kid looked at him, looked away and kept talking to his mom. And everything was fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack El Hai’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFace-Transplant-Medical-Restored-Identity-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0C9TPLY32&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Face in The Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is published on May 20th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are based in the U.S. and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

            Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanew0gx00013b6n9gdwor07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It kept him alive, but it didn’t feel like living.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00043b6m3t98ittx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00053b6mz8gxb2yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/health/pig-kidney-transplant-clinical-trials/index.html"&gt;experimental cross-species transplant&lt;/a&gt; of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, he’s the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00073b6m67359izc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it — for him and for fellow patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00083b6m8foh7j82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will do something for humanity,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000a3b6m2szf47wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2½ years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure — his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000b3b6msczywxmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrews’ kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000c3b6m38wqpa0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a “huge burden” on the body, Andrews’ doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/702274#:~:text=Bethesda%2C%20MD%E2%80%94Patients%20with%20advanced%20kidney%20disease%20who,removed%20by%20hemodialysis%2C%20increase%20heart%20attack%20risk." target="_blank"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000d3b6mw8zvtcrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,” said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000e3b6mgr7h4b0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should “pick a box.” With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000f3b6m4t6h8t12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, he’d sleep. By the time he woke up, he’d have to start the process all over again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000g3b6mwxew95am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000h3b6mqg2kdxnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldn’t eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000i3b6mg61t1v83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the hours ticked past, he couldn’t think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000j3b6mol95kpqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldn’t let him. He also kept hearing his father’s voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000m3b6muwm2xh6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000n3b6m34na9r5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://unos.org/news/90000-people-are-waiting-for-a-kidney-heres-one-way-to-get-them-a-kidney-faster/#:~:text=Dialysis%20is%20a%20lifesaving%20treatment,day%20waiting%20for%20a%20kidney." target="_blank"&gt;Nearly 90,0000 people&lt;/a&gt; are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most don’t get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000o3b6m5xzxsd14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews’ chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000q3b6mfmcv3szq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little short there,” Andrews said. “I know what end-stage means.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000r3b6mfbnmk5j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000s3b6mu1migh6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they first met, Andrews was “very frail,” Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned what’s known as xenotransplantation — transplants using genetically modified pig organs — Andrews’ eyes “sparked.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000t3b6mx21pyge9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He said ‘Tell me what I need to do.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000v3b6m5rc5oniq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella told Andrews he’d need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000w3b6m4t7f8xht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They said, ‘Prepare your body for battle,’ ” Andrews’ wife, Karen, remembered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000x3b6mu0w9aobo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000y3b6m09f5bksv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was “almost running around the room.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmandkmvj00003b6mb5p39kcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, she’d be exposed to it, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00123b6mnbvk30gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little taken aback by that,” Karen said. But she didn’t have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00133b6muz8yae08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to be better than dialysis,” she said. “He was just feeling so awful all the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00153b6mz6vnmfzj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In January, it was finally time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00163b6mfrop1fya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00173b6mgehl3q19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went “unbelievably well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00193b6mo8eeynjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/mgh-performs-second-xenotransplant-of-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-into-living-recipient" target="_blank"&gt;team of doctors&lt;/a&gt; told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrews’ nonfunctioning organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001a3b6mjtm5s3vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,” Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001b3b6m99wl94rr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, I started bawling like a baby,” Karen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001c3b6m4mwjjubb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001d3b6m8qa25yiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001e3b6ml5hfezgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/role-hospitals-massachusetts-general-hospital-team-performs-second-xenotransplant-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-living" target="_blank"&gt;“reenergized and revitalized.”&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001f3b6m6fmfrbwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was alive, and I hadn’t been in a long time,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001g3b6m8bk9xgag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001h3b6mvrcka5bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a miracle,” Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001i3b6ml4vkhpun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said ‘look at me, it’s like I’m like a new man,’ ” he said. “It’s like new birth. I said, ‘I’ve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001j3b6mmt7enzkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001k3b6mci843jr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the months since, he’s had a few “small bumps in the road,” including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001l3b6mnq7xe1gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001m3b6m2y5z915d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications he’ll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001n3b6ms5wxs3lh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001o3b6m128588nc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He even lets himself picture a future. He can’t wait to see his grandkids again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001p3b6mbo87vneu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They saw me at the lowest, and now they’ll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001q3b6mkdjn1eid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said they’ve put it off far too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaned9de000z3b6m35ut0cwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. He’s still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first — and a success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001w3b6mvyb5rfej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he won’t be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;United Therapeutics Corp&lt;/a&gt; – the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys – announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanv2g6f00033b6nzvnkrz0b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2412747" target="_blank"&gt;March 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/pig-kidney-transplant-patient-home/index.html"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt; at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001y3b6mgnzd3kb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and it’s probably important to get patients like Andrews, who haven’t needed dialysis as long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmantqqty00003b6nnua2387k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removal/index.html"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the next month. She died in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001z3b6m4mf9tsiz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/third-pig-kidney-transplant"&gt;Towana Looney&lt;/a&gt; with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removed-longest-in-living-patient/index.html"&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; it in April when her immune system started to reject it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00203b6m5pb5qb04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looney’s had fewer. Doctors say they still don’t know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00213b6mn3jydp5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00223b6melm7sxdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is a learning curve,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00233b6mxk6poum0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the world’s organ shortage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00243b6mffsi70wv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,” he said. “Without them willing to take the risk, we wouldn’t be able to move this to the clinic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00253b6m9j2g5psa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00263b6mjkv94irk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ‘ah, I can handle that’ and everything, but it’s tough,” he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. “It was very tough to realize that was it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00273b6mndkr1yym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was going to die in this building.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00283b6mu67b6cva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00293b6mvsmye15u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I see way too many people give up,” Andrews said. “Don’t give up.”

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from the &lt;strong&gt;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)&lt;/strong&gt; has shown that long-term retinal regeneration in mammals is possible. This development holds the potential to restore vision for millions suffering from retinal diseases, a condition that affects over &lt;strong&gt;300 million people&lt;/strong&gt; globally. For years, retinal degeneration, such as that seen in &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, has been a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Now, researchers have taken a significant step toward reversing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A breakthrough in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists at KAIST, has successfully demonstrated the regeneration of retinal cells in mice, a species that shares many biological traits with humans. This study, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58290-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, builds on decades of research into the regenerative abilities of animals like zebrafish. Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regrow retinal cells after an injury. However, the challenge for mammals, including humans, is that their central nervous system lacks the capacity for such regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers focused on &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which support retinal neurons. In zebrafish, these cells are able to reprogram themselves into retinal neurons after an injury. Unfortunately, mammals do not possess this regenerative ability. The breakthrough at KAIST involved manipulating a protein called &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, which typically prevents the development of new retinal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By suppressing PROX1 in mice, the team was able to stimulate the growth of new retinal neurons, effectively bypassing the limitations that have long hindered mammalian retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo courtesy of KAIST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The role of PROX1 in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt; plays a crucial role in preventing retinal cell regeneration in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/this-80000-year-old-tool-shouldnt-exist-neanderthals-werent-supposed-to-build-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79904" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;. It had been known that this protein accumulates in &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; after retinal damage, where it suppresses the development of new retinal cells. Interestingly, this inhibitory process does not occur in zebrafish, which explains their ability to regenerate retinal tissue. By blocking &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers were able to override this suppression in mice, leading to sustained retinal regeneration for &lt;strong&gt;six months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This long-term regenerative response was a first in the field of mammalian retinal regeneration. The results of this study could have profound implications for treating retinal diseases such as &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, where the photoreceptor cells in the retina deteriorate over time, leading to blindness. If this method can be adapted for human use, it would mark a major advancement in regenerative medicine and provide new hope for people affected by these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo courtesy of KAIST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing zebrafish and mammalian retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery builds on the remarkable regenerative capabilities of animals like zebrafish, which are able to reprogram their &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; into functional retinal neurons following injury. Zebrafish and other animals, such as amphibians, have been known to regenerate parts of their central nervous system, including retinal tissue. This ability has made zebrafish a model organism for studying retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, mammals have evolved to lack this regenerative capacity. The difference between these species lies in the molecular pathways that govern tissue regeneration. For years, scientists have been trying to identify which proteins or pathways could be manipulated to trigger similar regenerative processes in mammals. The work at KAIST, which targets &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, offers a potential solution to this problem, showing that a simple genetic alteration can lead to the regeneration of retinal neurons in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving forward with human applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study offers a promising direction for future research into retinal regeneration and vision restoration. Scientists have already begun exploring ways to apply the findings from this study to human retinal diseases. With conditions like &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/strong&gt; affecting millions, the ability to regenerate retinal cells could provide a revolutionary treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also considering how this technique might be integrated with other advancements in retinal treatment, such as &lt;strong&gt;gene therapy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;stem cell therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;laser-based technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. The progress made in this study is a significant step forward, and it brings hope that one day, it may be possible to regenerate retinal tissue in humans and reverse the effects of blindness caused by retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Delicious, right? Now imagine that same treats doing wonders for your heart by lowering your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers from the University of Surrey, these tasty treats seem to be more than indulgences – they could help maintain blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, zeroes in on flavan-3-ols – plant compounds found in cocoa, tea, apples, and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings? Regular consumption of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-chocolate-survive-dna-research-may-help-save-cacao-trees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; may lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function. Who knew heart health could taste so good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-foods-that-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Everyday foods that lower blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols may sound like something you’d find in a chemistry lab, but they’re actually hiding in your kitchen. These natural compounds are abundant in everyday foods like tea, dark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, and apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 145 randomized controlled trials, and the results were intriguing. People who consumed more flavan-3-ols had lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist – in some cases, the effects of these compounds were comparable to certain blood pressure medications. Imagine getting a similar result from a cup of tea as you would from a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-tea-and-chocolate-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Can tea and chocolate lower blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hot mug of tea, a piece of dark chocolate melting in your mouth  – it sounds too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t suggest swapping medicine for a snack. But it does raise an interesting point: Certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; could play a supportive role in managing cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high blood pressure saw the most significant benefits from flavan-3-ols. The takeaway? The foods you love might just love you back – if you consume them in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-beyond-blood-pressure"&gt;Benefits beyond blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure wasn’t the only focus of this study. The researchers also took a closer look at the endothelium – the inner lining of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the gateway for blood flow. When the endothelium functions well, blood flows smoothly. When it doesn’t, the risk of heart disease rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols seemed to strengthen this crucial lining, even in participants whose blood pressure didn’t budge. That means a square of dark chocolate or a few apple slices could potentially protect your heart in ways you can’t see but your body will feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Christian Heiss, a cardiovascular medicine expert at the &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt; and the study’s lead author, is cautiously optimistic about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes,” said Professor Heiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tea-and-chocolate-won-t-replace-meds"&gt;Tea and chocolate won’t replace meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start piling up chocolate bars or guzzling gallons of tea, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tea-bags-release-millions-of-plastic-particles-during-brewing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caveat&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Heiss emphasizes that this study doesn’t give the green light to ditch your prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-too-much"&gt;How much is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how much flavan-3-ols do you need to see a benefit? The study doesn’t provide a magic number. A cup of tea, a small square of dark chocolate, or a handful of grapes might do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep it real – too much of anything can backfire. More chocolate doesn’t mean more health benefits. Balance is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark chocolate and tea might get all the attention, but other foods are just as rich in flavan-3-ols. Apples, grapes, and even cocoa powder pack a punch. The trick is to incorporate a variety of these foods into your diet – not just the ones that taste like dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study might open the door, but it doesn’t close the case. The researchers are far from finished – they’re just getting started. They want to keep peeling back the layers, uncovering how flavan-3-ols really work over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these compounds have the same impact on people with various health conditions? How much is enough to make a difference without overdoing it? And could something as ordinary as a cup of tea or a piece of dark chocolate eventually earn a spot in public health recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions hang in the air, unanswered but compelling. The study may have given us a glimpse, but the full picture is still coming into focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, every sip, every bite, every moment of mindful indulgence could be another clue in the unfolding story of how simple foods might carry profound possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea and dark chocolate – not miracle cures, yet far more than mere indulgences.

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A gut doctor has warned of a little-known red flag sign that can indicate deadly bowel &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-3b250c70-30ab-11f0-927f-0fa391ca5e97"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it is well known that abdominal pain is a sign of the condition, gastroenterologist Dr Joseph Salhab highlighted a specific detail that the public should pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salhab urged people to watch out for persistent abdominal pain that's 'localised in the same spot' and is associated with a new bout of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622475/drink-instantly-relieves-constipation-better-laxative.html"&gt;constipation &lt;/a&gt;or diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the pain is bad enough to disturb your sleep, you should also see a GP, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If it wakes you up at night because it's so bad, these are not signs you should ignore,' advised Dr Salhab in an Instagram &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJcSzreutyD/"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;that has been viewed over 512,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to a video of a 28-year-old woman whose cancer was mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome, the US-based specialist went on to list other warning signs of the deadly cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A change in your stool caliber with thin stools or even with rectal bleeding and weight loss are not signs you should ignore,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said that if the pain does not improve with dietary changes or bowel movements, this could be a red flag sign.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Salhab warned of the specific symptoms that could be a red flag for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bleeding from the back passage, or blood in the stool, occurs when cancerous tumours bleed into the digestive tract. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other warning signs of the cancer include a lump in the abdomen, bloating and feeling very tired or short of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, bowel cancer can also appear with no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as&lt;span&gt; diagnoses of the disease have sky rocketed by 80 per cent in under 50s across the globe within the last 30 years, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;suggests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates of the disease in older age groups, who are statistically more likely to get the disease overall, have either declined or remained stable in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have suggested a host of factors are likely behind the phenomenon — from increased pollution to rising obesity and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetic factors are also likely to play a role, according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt;. But diets high in ultra-processed foods, salt and alcohol and low in vitamins and minerals are the main risk factors underling the most common cancers in under-50s. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer, killing almost 17,000 people each year, with the number of young-onset cases continuing to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis suggests deaths from bowel cancer overall in the UK are set to rise by 2,5000 a year by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the number of people in the UK diagnosed with the disease will rise by around a tenth in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 Cancer Research UK analysis of 50 countries revealed that England saw the fourth fastest annual rise in the rate of early-onset bowel cancer in the decade to 2017, faster than any other country in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Photo By Tony Guerrero/Hays Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By TONY GUERRERO&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hays Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three years, Amy Baltodano dealt with unexplained symptoms before doctors diagnosed her with a rare and fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was so overwhelming and sad, but I was happy that I finally knew what was going on," Amy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease is a genetic condition that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;44-year-old Amy is a single mother in Hays and a former programmer at Eagle Radio who is now dedicated to raising awareness about her illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May is Huntington's disease awareness month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is the only person in Hays living with the fatal disease that she is aware, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy began experiencing symptoms such as movement problems, trouble speaking and difficulty understanding before her primary doctor suspected Huntington’s disease. She was officially diagnosed on Nov. 15, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It causes impairment of the ability to function like a normal person. Opening stuff and bottles is really hard for me to do. I need to have my daughter help me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy also deals with involuntary jerking movements known as chorea, along with anxiety, depression and muscle pain. She remains under the care of her primary doctor and neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy previously underwent speech therapy and now participates in occupational and physical therapy. She also takes medication to manage her symptoms and wears a vest to help control her movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy could not continue working as her symptoms worsened and fatigue set in. Fortunately, she isn’t facing the journey alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My parents are helping out with rent, bills and for my daughter's education," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is adopted and has no contact with her biological parents, which has made it harder for her to trace the origins of her Huntington’s disease. Since the condition is inherited, the lack of a known family medical history has left many questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wishes she had looked for her birth parents, but emphasized that she deeply loves and appreciates her adoptive parents, Allen and Rosalie Schmeidler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amy's been a trooper. Her dad and I are so proud of her for the way she's handling this," Rosalie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy received her diagnosis on Allen’s birthday, making the news especially emotional. While the family was initially shocked, they felt relieved to understand what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was shocked but kind of relieved to finally know what was actually wrong," Allen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosalie and Allen said their daily routine now revolves around Amy’s needs. They regularly take her to physical and occupational therapy, and travel to Kansas City every three months for neurology appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said her 15-year-old daughter, Mia Baltodano, is her greatest source of joy and support, even though discussing the diagnosis with her has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's the best person ever. I love her so much... her and my family have been so supportive," Amy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing her biological family history has created uncertainty about her daughter’s potential risk, as Amy has no way of knowing which side the gene came from. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117#:~:text=Overview,changed%20gene%20from%20a%20parent."&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, a child of a parent with Huntington’s has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is determined to raise awareness about the illness in her free time, especially in a community where the condition is not well known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said she and her family have begun preparing for the future, including arrangements for Mia's care and planning Amy's funeral as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really depressing for Allen and me," Rosalie said. "You always thought your children would outlive you. She still may, but now we have to think of if we're not here, we have to have everything in place for her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said, "I really have nothing to lose now, so I'm just trying to live my days to the fullest... and watch a lot of reality TV. I can't get away from those housewives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosalie said when Amy is in public, people often misunderstand or even mock her involuntary movements, not realizing they are caused by a medical condition. Sometimes, it comes from adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family relies on their faith to navigate through the difficulties. Rosalie said she believes God gave Amy this challenge for a reason and trusts that she has the necessary strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He blessed us with Amy. He knew that she was a warrior who could handle this and be a fighter for this cause," Rosalie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the disease’s symptoms and fatal nature, Amy remains hopeful and focused on helping others identify early signs. She continues to stay alert for her daughter’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm nervous for her," Amy said. "At least we'll know if something does happen. We'll know the signs to look for that I didn't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy recommends the &lt;a href="https://hdsa.org/"&gt;Huntington’s Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt; as a resource for learning more about the condition. She also welcomes questions through her &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/amy.baltodano"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and said she’s happy to respond if she can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family thanks their doctors, therapist, neurologist, HaysMed, Northwest Kansas Area on Aging, and extended family and friends for supporting Amy's journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hays Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:02:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE55V3N2MUJ6eDlZMUtxNEN3aFlyMWc5THFSaGpYYlJtem1NNXVYbnhlSFVIdFRvbEF4ZEVWbjRmWHhCVkF4U2JsM2hLMDFlbUZlT3lPTEdhbWt1QkFMWk1HeXJEaXg4RmUzbm1sSFpCUGg</guid></item><item><title>我姐姐带着我的女儿去购物中心。我的妻子对她退回的条件感到愤怒-石板杂志 | My Sister Took My Daughter to the Mall.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79guy001w3b76wt7oi3yq@published"&gt;Last weekend my sister “Laura” babysat my two kids, “Vivianna,” 8, and “Jaden,” 6, while my wife “Kaitlyn” and I went out of town to attend a friend’s wedding. Laura took the kids to the mall, and while they were there, Vivianna made a pretty big request, to make a kind of permanent decision that parents often set rules around.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman7a9n4002d3b76cbqv0vde@published"&gt;Vivianna asked if she could get her ears pierced. Laura allowed it. When we got home the next day and found out, Kaitlyn hit the roof. I literally had to physically restrain her to keep her from attacking my sister. She says she doesn’t want the kids around Laura ever again and is even looking into suing her! To make matters worse, she has involved nearly the entire family and has made clear that either they are with her or they are the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79gv6001x3b76qpa6g4fp@published"&gt;While I do wish Laura had consulted us before allowing Vivianna to get her ears pierced, I personally don’t have a problem with it—I knew girls younger than that with pierced ears when I was a kid. I think my wife is needlessly blowing this totally out of proportion. She is forcing everyone in the family to choose sides and using access to our kids as leverage. It’s turned into an incredibly ugly situation, and it didn’t need to escalate to this level. Laura has always been the cool aunt whom the kids look forward to seeing, and they are both incredibly sad over the whole thing. Laura sent a note of apology, which my wife immediately tore up and mailed back to her. Whenever I attempt to reason with Kaitlyn, I am told I can either choose her and the kids or my sister. Is there any way to repair this family rift?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79gv700203b76zxxzgewa@published"&gt;Your sister absolutely should have spoken with you and your wife first before letting your daughter get a body-altering procedure. It shows a clear lack of judgement on her part, and I understand why your wife might not trust her decision-making skills.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79gv700213b76k6v9xas3@published"&gt;That said, your wife’s response sounds totally overblown and immature. Trying to get into a physical altercation? Sending back ripped up letters? What is she 15? Does she actually expect you to make some kind of decision between your sister and your kids? None of this is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

(I might suggest approaching this conversation with curiosity instead of an “attempt to reason” with her.) Maybe there’s some bigger issue. You might start by trying to ask exactly what about the pierced ears upset her. It may have been that your wife wanted to be there for this step of her daughter’s life. It might be about the principle of it not having been cleared with you first. Or maybe these actions your wife took in response might point to some larger issue between her and your sister that reached its crescendo with the piercing incident. Getting her to explore the actual details of what’s upsetting her might help her realize that her behavior is outsized and also not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, my husband was sick and so I was on parenting duty solo. No big deal, but it was a tiring day juggling my work, their afterschool activities, and their care. I truly feel that it was an uneventful day. I didn’t feel particularly grumpy at all. When I was tucking the kids into bed, they told me &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/03/graduation-ticket-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;some things about myself that were very hurtful, and left me in tears&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, instead of investing in various lotions and potions that may or may not effectively contribute to healthy aging, a group of scientists suggests that the fountain of youth could be hiding in your fridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, researchers from Edith Cowan University, Queen's University Belfast, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published a new study in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121914.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, showcasing how certain foods could help people age more gracefully and enjoy longer, healthier lives. It all comes down to flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of medical research is not just to help people live longer but to ensure they stay healthy for as long as possible," Dr Nicola Bondonno, an adjunct lecturer at ECU, shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121914.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We know from previous research that people who have a higher flavonoid intake tend to live longer, and they are also less likely to get any of the major chronic diseases such as dementia, diabetes, or heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly are flavonoids?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 research review in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Nutritional Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of Nutritional Science&lt;/a&gt; explains that flavonoids are "a group of natural substances … found in fruits, vegetables, grains, bark, roots, stems, flowers, tea, and wine." Vegetables use them to help grow and defend against plaque buildup. They also provide the vibrant colors found in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. "Currently, there are about 6,000 flavonoids that contribute to the colourful pigments of fruits, herbs, vegetables, and medicinal plants," the study stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can these flavonoids do for people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids are well known for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, supporting blood vessel health, and even helping to maintain skeletal muscle mass — all of which are important for preventing frailty and maintaining physical function and mental health as we age," professor Aedin Cassidy from Queens University Belfast, and senior author of the study, shared. "Our research shows that people who consume more flavonoids tend to age better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, the researchers analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which tracked 62,743 women and 23,687 men over the course of 24 years. They calculated flavonoid intake by tracking each study's "food frequency questionnaires."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/best-diet-for-healthy-aging-alternative-healthy-eating-index-11727782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Only 1 in 10 People Age Well — and They All Have This Eating Plan in Common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Only 1 in 10 People Age Well — and They All Have This Eating Plan in Common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the numbers, the researchers found that women who consumed the most flavonoids had a 15% lower risk of frailty and a 12% lower risk of poor mental health. They also found that these women had a 12% lower risk of "impaired physical function" when compared to those with a lower flavonoid intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men had fewer extreme health associations, but it still resulted in a net positive for those who consumed the most flavonoids. However, the researchers noted that this difference could be attributed to the varying follow-up times between the two gender cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that participants who increased their intake of flavonoid-rich food by three servings a day had a 6% to 11% lower risk across all three of the ageing outcomes in females, and a 15% lower risk of poor mental health in males," Cassidy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The researchers found that these specific foods pack the biggest flavonoid punch.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, "... increases in intakes of tea, red wine, apples, blueberries, and oranges [and orange juice] tended to be associated with lower risks of all outcomes." The researchers also specifically highlighted black tea as an excellent option in a &lt;a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/Research/GRI/TheInstituteforGlobalFoodSecurity/institute-for-global-security-news/Blackteaandberriescouldcontributetohealthierageing.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the list of flavonoid-rich foods and drinks is much longer than that. As the review in the Journal of Nutritional Science explained, flavones, one of the subgroups within flavonoids, can be found in items such as celery, parsley, red peppers, chamomile, mint, and ginkgo biloba, white onions, kale, lettuce, tomatoes, apples, grapes, and berries are "rich sources of flavonols." It added that another subgroup, isoflavonoids, is somewhat more limited but is "predominantly found in soybeans and other leguminous plants." Additionally, one more group, anthocyanins, which are the pigments "responsible for colors in plants, flowers and fruits," are found in all the most colorful (and delicious) fruits, including "cranberries, black currants, red grapes, merlot grapes, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, bilberries, and blackberries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/bananas-lower-blood-pressure-study-11727728" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Inexpensive Fruit Can Help Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Inexpensive Fruit Can Help Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, any fruit, vegetable, or tea will provide the flavonoids you're looking for. But if you truly want to do everything possible to prevent frailty in old age, the researchers in the latest study indicate that you need one additional component: Protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The significance of diet — both quantity and quality — in mitigating frailty is widely acknowledged, with higher protein intake, better diet quality, and a higher consumption of healthy plant-based foods, consistently being identified as key factors,: they noted. And as professor Eric Rimm from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health added, "Overall, these findings underscore the potential for simple dietary modifications to impact overall quality of life and contribute to the optimisation of healthy aging." &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/healthy-aging-flavonoid-rich-foods-11733659" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5IbzZ6UzJBVG5ybC1LdTU3cFNUVHcta3FLdXN1aHF0SWE4UWF6Q1kwZ1J2WFBXUHlJamhtR1dHaXBpT3dpazlTZ1hmcVM3ZU5PYlg4cU1RSUhlYk9KaF80Sjc2OXpCbTVCaFV5a2F3</guid></item><item><title>“点亮”隐藏乳腺癌的原型- BBC | Prototype 'to light up' hidden breast cancers -

Most patients recover quickly, but a small minority suffer heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although broken heart syndrome is most common in women, men die from it at more than twice the rate, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank"&gt;a study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 adults in the U.S. who were hospitalized with broken heart syndrome from 2016 to 2020. Around 11% of men in that group died, compared with roughly 5% of women. The data reinforce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002914921009371" target="_blank"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; that showed &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.23109" target="_blank"&gt;higher mortality rates in men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It seems to be a consistent finding that men don’t get takotsubo syndrome as much, but when they do, they do worse,” said Dr. Harmony Reynolds, director of the Sarah Ross Soter Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Research at NYU Langone Health, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The differences between men and women may have something to do with what’s triggering their conditions, cardiologists said. In men, broken heart syndrome is usually brought on by a physical stressor, such as a surgery or stroke. In women, the impetus is typically emotional, like losing a job or loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The people with emotional stressors actually do quite well,” said Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who wasn’t part of the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” he said. “So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study’s lead author, Dr. Mohammad Movahed, said men may also have a harder time recovering from broken heart syndrome since they &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/01/16/men-women-and-social-connections/" target="_blank"&gt;tend to have less social support&lt;/a&gt; to help them manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have this stressful trigger, and the stress is not gone, that’s probably going to continue to harm the heart, or at least reduce the chance of recovery,” said Movahed, a cardiologist at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But scientists still have lingering questions about what’s driving the syndrome, and why people die from it in rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“People are still looking for the holy grail of what causes this condition,” Wittstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is stress the only trigger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To confirm that a person has broken heart syndrome, doctors look for a few tell-tale signs. In a typical patient, part of their heart muscle is enlarged like a balloon, but they do not have a blocked artery, which is usually associated with heart attacks. Most patients can also point to a stressful event that predated the episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The stresses that we endure in our daily lives, both physical and emotional, can in fact take tolls on us,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City. “You can feel the heartache in those moments, and there may literally be some heartache of sorts that’s accompanying that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Wittstein said stress alone may not be enough to trigger broken heart syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people just get a little frustrated at work, or somebody was out jogging a little too vigorously, or somebody just got stuck at a red light and was annoyed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Reynolds said one of her patients has had the syndrome four times — each event precipitated by minor stomach bugs that caused her to vomit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She just really hates vomiting and will throw up and get” takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wittstein now believes some patients may have an underlying susceptibility to broken heart syndrome. His research suggests that stress hormones can constrict tiny blood vessels surrounding the heart, which decrease blood flow. That would make certain people, such as those with high blood pressure or high cholesterol, more susceptible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research has also shown that post-menopausal women are more prone to broken heart syndrome. Wittstein said that’s probably due, in part, to a decline in estrogen, which helps dilate the tiny blood vessels around the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Reynolds said there’s not enough research to know that for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s at some level obvious that sex hormones are implicated but trying to draw that link and really connect the dots, we have not gotten there yet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard to treat, hard to prevent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cardiologists said the mysteries surrounding broken heart syndrome can make it hard to prevent or treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors occasionally prescribe medications used for other heart issues, such as beta blockers, or find ways to help people reduce stress, such as meditating and talking to a mental health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have not found anything so far — any medication, any specific treatment — that can reduce complications or reduce mortality,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;His new study found that deaths from broken heart syndrome were relatively stable from 2016 to 2020 — a sign that the current treatment landscape isn’t sufficient, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Wittstein said the study relied on diagnostic codes given to hospitalized patients, which can sometimes miss the full picture of what contributed to a person’s death, especially if that person had a stroke or other neurological issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m quite sure that some of these people recovered from the broken heart syndrome and then died of complications of something else,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cardiologists said their best advice is to encourage patients to go to the hospital if they have chest pain or shortness of breath, and not to dismiss their symptoms as stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“You can’t tell the difference between this and traditional heart attacks until you get to the hospital and have a series of tests,” Reynolds said. “So it is not appropriate to stay home when you have chest pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNRFc1RmdlUzBSVUxzdTY2NS1VS1hTcWh4aFRfSDIzUEtBN2hoTm0tS2Z5dnhoa0h1QWlzV0lMY2pYVXZiU3Yzd1FlVHdWa3pjYjV0MmFOMTBJRDdnNHVJd1dMRGIwMU5LRUR1alhxLVg5cF9sU1lnRkZsdW1pNTJ4aEVERXVfZ19JYXFHRTVidUJmQjNvemJWLXFSUWItckg0XzNQcktPMWJld9IBVkFVX3lxTFBjLW9OLUVIZ2FfNTJZTHdpa0ZTZVN4UmxDQjZ3UVhYVUM0VlJxbVZxRlZpWDZ4X2UyazVXWkxBbHU4WGhQc1dpb2kzWWUtMEU3QUtfRGlR</guid></item><item><title>爆米花肺：青少年的电子烟习惯导致不可逆转的肺部疾病- SciTechDaily | Popcorn Lung: Teen’s Vaping Habit Leads to Irreversible Lung Disease - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNdFdXbV9iSjJyQ0pCRTNHbTJ5YmlZaEZEa24zTURzcV9ZQVNERHU3S3QtM3NlVHFRdXkyQ0o5ZGQ1cHVaYktEZDBrYmFXN2pIV2p2a0pxeWt6ajdpYlJDUml3NFFWazhzOWZsR3NkVDMxbmdDSk9uc0I0aU9TMUpuanhEUDM2cE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 07:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNdFdXbV9iSjJyQ0pCRTNHbTJ5YmlZaEZEa24zTURzcV9ZQVNERHU3S3QtM3NlVHFRdXkyQ0o5ZGQ1cHVaYktEZDBrYmFXN2pIV2p2a0pxeWt6ajdpYlJDUml3NFFWazhzOWZsR3NkVDMxbmdDSk9uc0I0aU9TMUpuanhEUDM2cE0</guid></item><item><title>关于手指在水中皱纹的方式的奥秘可能有一个答案- ScienceAlert | Mystery About The Way Fingers Wrinkle in Water Might Have an Answer - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNZ3A3bEYtd2JScFVZSTVtaXVNMTF4OFM2UDllR0JmcVpRVW9jRnpid1F3VFRaSmxPZm9uNGdpdTNaRkZDUHpsWUxNdVBCMGFuLW9HN1Y4NjdhWF9ReFdFWThmRjVvaEozbGVaTWF0eXVSVm53Tlh0SmQzMEpzelhNZ2ZpWjE2VWNDcE8tZXhPNmJTbmRjZ1BYb1Vlcko?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-fingers-get-wrinkly-after-a-long-bath-or-swim-a-biomedical-engineer-explains-204726"&gt;the blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; responsible for our water-soaked finger wrinkles, young readers of &lt;em&gt;The Conversation's&lt;/em&gt;  Curious Kids series had further questions for scientists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do the wrinkles always form in the same way?" one asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And I thought: I haven't the foggiest clue!" &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; the author of the educational article, biomedical engineer Guy German from Binghamton University in New York . "So it led to this research to find out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German and his colleague Rachel Laytin recruited three volunteers to soak their fingers for 30 minutes. Images confirm the patterns of looped peaks and valleys adorning the participants' sodden fingertips mostly repeated themselves when they were soaked again 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161033" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LinesShowingTheSimilarityAndDifferencesOfFingerWringlingOnDifferentDays-e1747024909680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-161033 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161033" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lines trace the same wrinkles (black) and different wrinkles (red) on a volunteer's ring finger, after soaking on two different days. (Laytin &amp;amp; German, &lt;em&gt;J Mech Behav Biomed Mater&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As water seeps through open sweat ducts into our skin, it eventually decreases the concentration of salt in our outer layer. Nerve fibers alert the brain to this change in skin condition, which then triggers our bodies' automatic blood vessel retraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these tiny skin vessels shrink, they drag the surface of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470464/"&gt;our largest organ&lt;/a&gt; down with them, shriveling once-smooth fingers and toes into a rougher, pruney texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161032" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FingerWrinklesAfterSoakingOnceThenAgain24HoursLater-e1747024489425.jpg" alt="An image of a smooth finger tip and then two similar water wrinkled fingers" class="wp-image-161032 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161032" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The changes observed in one of the volunteer's finger tips across the experiment. (Laytin &amp;amp; German, &lt;em&gt;J Mech Behav Biomed Mater&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessels don't change their position much – they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they're pretty static," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; German. "That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puckering isn't just a random side-effect either. The morphological changes create a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253185"&gt;measurable advantage in wet conditions&lt;/a&gt;: the skin's temporary grooves and ridges provide a better grip, making it easier for us to walk on or grasp sodden things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these wrinkles give us super grip it seems odd we don't keep them full time. While researchers don't know why this is, they suspect the temporary texture might &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/proven-pruney-fingers-give-you-a-better-grip-598524/"&gt;reduce our finger's sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; or make them more vulnerable to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161044" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524.jpg" alt="Your Fingers Wrinkle The Same Way Each Time They're Soaked" class="wp-image-161044 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524-362x415.jpg 362w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524-600x687.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161044" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When small blood vessels inside the skin contract, they make your skin wrinkle.(&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skin_layers.png"&gt;Madhero88/Wikipedia/CC BY SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was originally assumed that swelling caused soaked skin to wrinkle, but a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-016-1764-6&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1747188450836924&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2wkESk6xIQvpsdPDkxHVu5"&gt;study in 2016&lt;/a&gt; revealed our skin would need to swell at least 20 percent for that to happen. What's more, previous research found people with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084949"&gt;nerve damage don't experience finger pruning&lt;/a&gt;, leading to further investigation of the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've heard that wrinkles don't form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; German. "One of my students told us, 'I've got median nerve damage in my fingers.' So we tested him – no wrinkles!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-fingers-get-wrinkly-after-a-long-bath-or-swim-a-biomedical-engineer-explains-204726"&gt;sating childlike curiosity&lt;/a&gt;, such details can assist in forensics. For example, understanding this finger skin distortion could help identify bodies after prolonged water exposure after natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can now add wrinkle topology to the set of consistent patterns that compose our skin, along with fingerprints and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;hidden stripes&lt;/a&gt; we all possess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161043" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161043" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody.jpg" alt="Your Fingers Wrinkle The Same Way Each Time They're Soaked" class="wp-image-161043 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody.jpg 914w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-642x637.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-418x415.jpg 418w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-768x762.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-600x595.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161043" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;Lines of Blaschko&lt;/a&gt; are another example of consistent patterns that arise from our skin's physiology.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda, have observed that these primates don't just treat their own injuries, but care for others, too—information which could shed light on how our ancestors first began treating wounds and using medicines.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Although chimpanzees elsewhere have been observed helping other community members with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical problems&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent presence of this behavior in Budongo could suggest that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical care&lt;/a&gt; among chimpanzees is much more widespread than we realized, and not confined to care for close relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research helps illuminate the evolutionary roots of human medicine and health care systems," said Dr. Elodie Freymann of the University of Oxford, first author of the article in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/i&gt;. "By documenting how chimpanzees identify and utilize &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medicinal+plants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and provide care to others, we gain insight into the cognitive and social foundations of human health care behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists studied two communities of chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest—Sonso and Waibira. Like all chimpanzees, members of these communities are vulnerable to injuries, whether caused by fights, accidents, or snares set by humans. About 40% of all individuals in Sonso have been seen with snare injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers spent four months observing each community, as well as drawing on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/video+evidence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;video evidence&lt;/a&gt; from the Great Ape Dictionary database, logbooks containing decades of observational data, and a survey of other scientists who had witnessed chimpanzees treating illness or injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any plants chimpanzees were seen using for external care were identified; several turned out to have chemical properties which could improve &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wound+healing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt; and relevant traditional medicine uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their direct observational periods, the scientists recorded 12 injuries in Sonso, all of which were likely caused by within-group conflicts. In Waibira, five chimpanzees were injured—one female by a snare, and four males in fights. The researchers also identified more cases of care in Sonso than in Waibira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This likely stems from several factors, including possible differences in social hierarchy stability or greater observation opportunities in the more thoroughly habituated Sonso community," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;The roots of modern medicine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers documented 41 cases of care overall: seven cases of care for others—prosocial care—and 34 cases of self-care. These cases often included several different care behaviors, which might be treating different aspects of a wound, or might reflect a chimpanzee's personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chimpanzee wound care encompasses several techniques: direct wound licking, which removes debris and potentially applies antimicrobial compounds in saliva; finger licking followed by wound pressing; leaf-dabbing; and chewing plant materials and applying them directly to wounds," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All chimpanzees mentioned in our tables showed recovery from wounds, though, of course, we don't know what the outcome would have been had they not done anything about their injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also documented hygiene behaviors, including the cleaning of genitals with leaves after mating and wiping the anus with leaves after defecation—practices that may help prevent infections."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who cares?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the seven instances of prosocial care, the researchers found four cases of wound treatment, two cases of snare removal assistance, and one case where a chimpanzee helped another with hygiene. Care wasn't preferentially given by, or provided to, one sex or age group. On four occasions, care was given to genetically unrelated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These behaviors add to the evidence from other sites that chimpanzees appear to recognize need or suffering in others and take deliberate action to alleviate it, even when there's no direct genetic advantage," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The scientists call for more research into the social and ecological contexts in which care takes place, and which individuals give and receive care. One possibility is that the high risk of injury and death which Budongo chimpanzees all face from snares could increase the likelihood that these &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/chimpanzees/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt; care for each other's wounds, but we need more data to explore this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study has a few methodological limitations," cautioned Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The difference in habituation between the Sonso and Waibira communities creates an observation bias, particularly for rare behaviors like prosocial health care. While we documented plants used in health care contexts, further pharmacological analyses are needed to confirm their specific medicinal properties and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also, the relative rarity of prosocial health care makes it challenging to identify patterns regarding when and why such care is provided or withheld. These limitations highlight directions for future research in this emerging field."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001011"&gt;Obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; has many unknowns, including what causes it, why symptoms can differ so much between people, how medication and therapy for it actually work, and why treatment is effective for some people and not for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, my colleagues and I made a step toward unraveling some of these mysteries by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;shedding light on the genetics of OCD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessive compulsive disorder is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001011"&gt;most impairing illnesses&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Affecting about 1 in 50 people globally, OCD is among the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/depression-global-health-estimates"&gt;top 10 causes&lt;/a&gt; of years lost to disability, leading to harmful effects on a person's ability to work and function in the world and on their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with people without OCD, a person with the condition has a 30 percent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-077564"&gt;higher chance of dying prematurely&lt;/a&gt; from natural causes, such as infections or other illnesses, and a 300 percent higher chance of dying early from nonnatural causes, such as accidents or suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with OCD experience obsessions – disturbing, recurrent and unwanted thoughts, fears or mental images – and compulsions, such as repetitive behaviors and rituals performed to ease the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder"&gt;anxiety usually caused by obsessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161312" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/OCD_anxiety_642.jpg" alt="person with anxiety" class="wp-image-161312 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/OCD_anxiety_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/OCD_anxiety_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/OCD_anxiety_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161312" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;OCD induces unwanted thoughts, behaviours, and compulsions to ease anxiety. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAESKRkeGEE/"&gt;Liza Summer/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone might wash their hands dozens of times or in a specific way to get rid of germs, even if they know it's excessive or illogical. Avoiding certain places or situations to reduce anxiety or prevent triggering obsessions and compulsions is also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact causes of OCD are unclear, researchers know that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development. OCD can run in families; studies attribute &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001744"&gt;between 40 percent to 65 percent&lt;/a&gt; of OCD cases to genetic factors. OCD that begins in childhood has a stronger genetic influence than OCD that begins in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike some genetic diseases caused by a single faulty gene, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis/causes"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/huntingtons-disease"&gt;Huntington's disease&lt;/a&gt;, OCD is influenced by hundreds to thousands of genes that each play a small part in disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I analyzed the DNA of over 53,000 people with OCD and over 2 million people without OCD, the largest study of this kind for this condition. We discovered &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;hundreds of genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; potentially linked to OCD – data we hope will ultimately lead to improved ways of identifying people who are at risk for OCD and, down the line, to better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How scientists study OCD genetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the genes involved in OCD risk, researchers use a method called a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg1521"&gt;genome-wide association study, or GWAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies compare the DNA of tens to hundreds of thousands of people with a disease of interest with the DNA of people without the disease, looking for tiny differences in the genetic material. These genetic markers may be linked to OCD or indicate the presence of other genes linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a GWAS, scientists carefully test each of the millions of genetic markers across the genome to identify those found more often in people with OCD than in people without OCD. They then determine which genes those markers are associated with, where in the body they are active and how they might contribute to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sOP8WacfBM8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;GWAS studies look for genetic associations between different traits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 30 areas in the genome linked to OCD, containing 249 genes of interest in total. Of those, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;25 genes stood out&lt;/a&gt; as likely contributors to the development of OCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top three genes we found are also linked to other brain disorders such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001744"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xhgg.2024.100377"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.47626/1516-4446-2023-3322"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. Several other genes of interest for OCD were found in a region of the genome that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-immunol-051116-052450"&gt;plays a role in adaptive immunity&lt;/a&gt; and has been associated with other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, no single gene can predict or cause OCD on its own. Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that genes across &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003864"&gt;all of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.b.32687"&gt;23 pairs&lt;/a&gt; of chromosomes in people may contribute to OCD risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic insights into OCD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the contribution of each genetic marker or gene to disease susceptibility is very small, GWAS are not useful for identifying genes that cause OCD for a given person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, this kind of research helps scientists understand how the brain works in people with OCD and whether OCD shares genetic roots with conditions that commonly occur alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the genetic markers we found to be associated with OCD were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;highly active&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12264-024-01252-9"&gt;several brain regions&lt;/a&gt; known to play a role in development of the condition. These brain areas are collectively involved in planning, decision-making, motivation, error detection, emotion regulation, and fear and anxiety, all of which can malfunction in OCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found associations with a brain region &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09727531241255492"&gt;called the hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt;, which converts emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety or excitement into physical responses. The hypothalamus has not been directly linked to OCD before, but it is part of a network of brain regions that may contribute to its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found that certain types of brain cells – particularly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.11.023"&gt;medium spiny neurons&lt;/a&gt; in a brain region called the striatum – were strongly linked to the OCD genes we identified. Medium spiny neurons play an important role in habit formation, the process by which a behavior becomes automatic and habitual – think compulsions. Specific receptors on medium spiny neurons are common targets for medications that are sometimes used to help treat OCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of our study can help researchers better understand the relationships between OCD and other conditions. We found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;genetic links&lt;/a&gt; between OCD and several other psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="161305" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anorexia and Tourette syndrome. People with OCD also showed lower genetic risk for conditions such as alcohol dependence and risk-taking behavior, aligning with what doctors see in clinics: Many people with OCD tend to be cautious and avoid risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we also found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;genetic overlaps&lt;/a&gt; between OCD immune-related conditions. While having OCD appears to be linked to an increased risk of asthma and migraines, it may also be linked to a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel disease. These findings may lead to new insights about the role the immune system and inflammation play in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More effective OCD treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCD is a complex disorder that can look very different from person to person. Understanding the genetic and biological factors behind OCD helps researchers move closer to better diagnosis, treatment and possibly even prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.ufl.edu/profile/mathews-carol/"&gt;practicing psychiatrist and researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I have spent my career working to understand the causes of OCD and to improve the lives of those who live with the condition.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study of nearly 5million adults ages 20 to 49, men living with NAFLD were also 17 percent more likely than women to be struck by colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers tied this to men being more likely to smoke and be obese, risk factors for liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the study, they said: 'Our findings revealed a strong link between NAFLD and early-onset CRC in young adults, suggesting the importance of implementing effective preventive strategies, particularly in populations with a growing burden of metabolic dysfunction.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;colorectal cancer surges in young Americans&lt;/a&gt;, with rates in under-50s increasing from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people in the last two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1542356525003441"&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated 4.6million adults in South Korea ages 20 to 49 from a South Korean insurance database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 2,733 developed early-onset colorectal cancer after an average of nine years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant underwent routine health checks in 2009 and was followed until 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were grouped into four categories: NAFLD, borderline NAFLD or no NAFLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver is diagnosed through a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 11 percent were diagnosed with NAFLD, 19 percent were borderline and 70 percent had no history of the condition. Participants in the NAFLD group tended to be older and male, smokers and mild-to-moderate drinkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also tended to have a higher BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure, all risk factors for liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking risk factors into account, patients&lt;span&gt; with NAFLD had a 24 percent increased risk of developing early colon cancer, and those in the borderline NAFLD group had a 12 percent higher chance compared to people without the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And of those with NAFLD, men were 17 percent more likely than women to develop colorectal cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As well as men living generally unhealthier lives, the researchers suggested the gender divide could be because the female sex hormone estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and protect against inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smoking, a risk factor for NAFLD, is also more common in men, and women are more likely to eat non-inflammatory fruits and vegetables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD patients in their 20s were also 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people in their 30s and 11 percent more likely than patients in their 40s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The likelihood of developing colon cancer was also 18 percent greater for non-diabetics compared to people with diabetes, leading the experts to suggest NAFLD may be a better indicator of colon cancer risk than diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide clinical evidence supporting a correlation between NAFLD and early-onset CRC.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team suggested NAFLD and early-onset colorectal cancer could be connected through shared 'inflammatory pathways.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professional baseball player Trey Mancini, pictured here with wife Sara, was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer at age 28, despite having no symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NAFLD often develops silently, causing inflammation and eventially permanent scarring of the liver (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of fatty liver disease can be difficult to notice at first, other than fatigue. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as swelling, red palms, and jaundice appear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD creates inflammation that damages cell DNA and causes cells to rapidly replicate, increasing the risk of cancerous cells forming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the researchers, chronic liver inflammation also releases cytokines - signaling proteins that communicate with the immune system - which promote the growth of cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD also disrupts the function of bile acids, which leads to imbalances in the gut microbiome, a risk factor for colorectal cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, NAFLD raised the risk of tumors specifically in the lower left side of the colon and the rectum, suggesting the condition targets lower areas of the colon and rectum, though the exact mechanism is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including a lack of data on family history, colon cancer stage and colonoscopy history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These findings highlight the need for multifaceted preventive strategies, including lifestyle interventions and expanded screening for younger populations with NAFLD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 02:43:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQUUJqXzEtWEFYWTlVcHpXS3VGZW1YYktseGpCb0praU50U2Zjd2lPV3dJcVhyT1BKY0wtV2FVX1FOWThsYUpTdWF5cnBDVFoxRFJrcHVrbWhrWFpiWmhHbTNWVVVsZFZwX2Y0VVFUWlA3UDczYXotOE1md0szMHhpSWJoeVlkQS1KdUhEbFVWMXQ5dnJQNWs2YmdXVGlXMHRpVUJnOGItTGJyZEg4TDBj0gG0AUFVX3lxTFByaGg0SVFkbHMxQnpnLXI1NHJnX0o3bDctMGhWTjE4LU5KVVdiYy1CaW42U2d1dThxT2drUU9pVU5yRzlKaUNVQ0ZfNW5RVC1lMVhSNkU4emFpVDZVaVVKSDA0c0tDWW9UeXRnR2ZYdlVJcmRtQjI3OGpUVWphVzFuM3ZzN21iZzZkaHNhN04zQjdFU2dCS3k3Ti14ZzBYX0V1UWI4NVVKMUU4b1BFUVN3NFQ2RQ</guid></item><item><title>一个多世纪以来，美国一些州的预期寿命几乎没有变化- ScienceAlert | Life Expectancy Has Barely Changed in Some US States For More Than a Century - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQZWF3aTY1VzM4UWRZSEdLVkROdWZMUGo2bUxTMzEyMlYzcHU3VGU0VFYzMWFsLUYtNGdsbFFlU1VWYzVSbkxHZWFFX2VwVEgxSV8tcnhTZzBTRmFyQzNsLWFJT0lRaVBWaktuYW10d0tIYi1Rd0dHZE5Mcno0SXhwT3NpV2paak5CNGU3cVV5Wkg2My1TV3hYdXZfYnVlVWppZjVXTTFsMFI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study highlights worrying differences in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-life-expectancy-reaches-highest-level-since-the-pandemic"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; trends across the United States, showing that states are far from equal when it comes to implementing public health measures and extending the lifespans of the people living within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions in the US and Canada looked at records covering more than 179 million deaths between 1969 and 2020, using a &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/methodologies/periodandcohortlifeexpectancyexplained"&gt;birth cohort&lt;/a&gt; approach to the data – so figuring out how long people of each generation lived for. The statistics were extrapolated to cover life expectancy changes between 1900 and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Looking at mortality trends by cohort gives us a more accurate reflection of the lived experiences of populations," &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/study-reveals-stark-differences-in-life-expectancy-across-us-states-over-the-past-century/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Theodore Holford, a biostatistician from the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shows the long-term impact of policies and social conditions affecting the life course of populations that might otherwise be invisible in year-by-year comparisons of mortality rates from different generations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160774" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160774" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WomenChart.jpg" alt="Female chart" class="wp-image-160774 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WomenChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WomenChart-628x415.jpg 628w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WomenChart-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160774" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life expectancies for women varied noticeably from state to state. (Ephemia Nicolakis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-breaking-human-lifespans-predicted-by-the-year-2060-heres-why"&gt;average life expectancy rose&lt;/a&gt; across the board for the years included in this study, there were major discrepancies between locations. For some states, especially in the South, there was little progress across a century of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains in life expectancy were in the northeastern and western states, and the District of Columbia (DC). In fact, DC showed remarkable improvements: life expectancy rose by 30 years for women and 38 years for men, from the lowest level across any of the states in 1900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160777" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160777" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/MenChart.jpg" alt="Male chart" class="wp-image-160777 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/MenChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/MenChart-628x415.jpg 628w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/MenChart-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160777" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There were also differences for life expectancy in men across states. (Ephemia Nicolakis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These gaps are indicators of multiple factors, the researchers say, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;socioeconomic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, access to healthcare, changing (or unchanging) demographics, and policies put in place by local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For females born in some Southern states, life expectancy increased by less than three years from 1900 to 2000," &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/study-reveals-stark-differences-in-life-expectancy-across-us-states-over-the-past-century/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Holford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's a staggering contrast when you consider that in states like New York and California, life expectancy rose by more than 20 years over the same period."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were stark differences too in mortality increases: how quickly your risk of death rises each year after 35. New York, DC, and Florida came out on top here, with Oklahoma, Iowa, and Kansas at the opposite end of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team hopes that the study could inform policymakers to tailor interventions that boost life expectancy, such as healthcare access and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/long-banned-pollutants-are-even-in-the-deepest-place-on-earth-study-reveals"&gt;environmental protections&lt;/a&gt;, based on the specific needs of different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/massive-cuts-to-health-and-human-services-workforce-signal-a-dramatic-shift-in-us-health-policy-253316"&gt;massive cuts to US government funding&lt;/a&gt; for healthcare and health research could set that goal back dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it's very difficult to pick out specific influences on life expectancy from such a broad collection of data, but it's clear that for now, where you live in the US goes a long way to determining how long you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research highlights the importance of viewing health through a generational lens," &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/study-reveals-stark-differences-in-life-expectancy-across-us-states-over-the-past-century/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jamie Tam, a health policy expert at YSPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of health interventions ripple across lifetimes. A failure to act early and invest in public health harms future generations as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.7695"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Measles can spread before a rash appears and people know they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" target="_blank" title="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;According to Public Health – Seattle and King County&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian resident visited the 16 locations listed below. The times listed include the estimated time the person was at the location and two hours after since the measles virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most residents in western Washington are immune to the disease through vaccination. According to Public Health – Seattle and King County, anyone who visited the locations above during the listed times and is not immune to measles will “most likely” become sick between May 7 – 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Globally and in the U.S., we are experiencing a significant measles resurgence. With over 1,000 cases reported so far this year nationally, 2025 is on track to have the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since the early 1990s,” said Meagan Kay, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. “It’s an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren’t protected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory disease.  The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The virus causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one person has measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County said up to nine out of 10 people nearby will also become infected if they’re not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can begin between seven to 21 days after exposure. The virus is contagious from around four days before a rash appears through four days after it appears, and the virus can be spread before the “characteristic measles rash” appears, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine because it's been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/09/measles-qa-with-dr-james-lewis-and-dr-alice-tin/" target="_blank" title="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/09/measles-qa-with-dr-james-lewis-and-dr-alice-tin/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Click here for more information and frequently asked questions about measles on the Public Health – Seattle and King County website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 00:26:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgJBVV95cUxOVmhMQnVudG9RVGF0MWQwT2Vocmd4Q3QwR3Y4RkZ0UUJnTXhyeWtMX3pTMXQwVS10T3pTenNkM1NSOXUxVzlrNVF3WEVyWjVuQmZzb0tUbWtVbzE4TGd1ZUF3akttZ3k2bWh1WE1tN2I3QXJCNEZGOUR5djZVc0tIajkzYXhLeXlGSE14bDk3RTM3VzltU20zXy1kU1NEcWJRNVlSdEFjUTE2M0Y2ZWJzeHMwbEozT0NnU05URWx3SUl3NlZtQUhHdG9Tc1BfYm91UnlpcHRDVlRud0FSYjJLTnIzYUJ4YTFZaWpZVTJZQ1pCZXRObEh4M0Z5ZFlEUmRDblBTRjliaWxTZUk1NlZtbVdtMUY3MEczV2ZzVG9wbXJkOUsyOEw2d3NFYWlaMHlXVVE</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们在20世纪60年代那么瘦？营养学家揭示过去的减肥秘诀-每日邮报 | Why were we so skinny in the 1960s?

Above, sunbathers sit in deckchairs at Virginia Beach in the 1960s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first driving factor behind the rise in obesity is the decline in home-cooked, fresh meals. These used to be the rule; not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They traditionally featured 'some type of really high quality protein, some fruit, some bread, some veggies and then probably milk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains this same nutritious formula applied to children's packed lunches for school, so kids were getting more of a balanced diet compared to today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was little mention of fast food, which has seen a surge in serving sizes - with calorie counts reaching nearly 2,000 for a serving of popular burgers and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From personal interactions with her family, she said in a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZTVRXivdVY"&gt; YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;: 'My dad said that they would pretty much always have like pot roast and my mom has a very specific, not fond, memory of lima [or butter] beans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates says the benefits of meals prepared at home include a lower sugar intake, extra protein and an increased amount of vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previous study from Johns Hopkins University found people who frequently cook their meals at home tend to consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat compared to those who don't cook as often. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, Ms Bates says another reason why today's society is fatter than ever is because of the explosion of ultra processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra processed foods, or UPFs, is an umbrella term used to cover anything with a long ingredients list or made with artificial additives like colorings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready meals, ice cream and ketchup are some of the most-loved examples of products that fall under the UPF term, now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why UPFs are bad, she says: 'Ultra processed is the next level of processing that really strips down the satiety and make you so much less satisfied from your food and therefore [you] need to eat even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are foods that are primarily going to have ingredients that you don't recognize and typically a long list of ingredients that you would not be able to just get your grocery store and recreate at home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates says it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans' diet today is made up of UPFs and 'some studies have found that these ultra processed foods can make us eat about 800 calories more a day because they are so much less satisfying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates (pictured above) reveals that in the 1960s America had an obesity rate of around 13 percent but today that number has more than tripled, with it now ballooning at 43 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates advises avoiding the fattening impact of these foods and swap them out for healthier alternatives - packaged snacks with added ingredients can be swapped for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continues: 'A large portion of the workforce back then had more physically demanding jobs. They also had a lot less structured activity, meaning that they didn't really work out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My dad will always say that he was super embarrassed when he was younger because his dad was a health nut at the time and would go for runs and his friends would make fun of him and ask what he was running from because people had more active jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They had a full day where they were more active versus a full day of sitting in front of a computer screen and then also probably commuting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates notes with the rise of technology, people have become more housebound and glued to their screens, so they are getting less physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'My mom said that if you had to stay inside, that was a punishment when she was a kid. Kids back in the 60s really didn't have anything inside that would entertain them as much, so they had to go outside and be active and play.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people who have computer based jobs, Ms Bates suggests getting a walking desk, so you can walk on a treadmill while you type and keep trim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of this, she recommends three to four days of structured exercise per week, such as strength training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Ms Bates points to a lack of sleep as another problem driving America's obesity epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today the average American adult gets around 7 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night and successful modern day individuals like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and President Donald Trump have claimed that 4 hours is the optimal amount of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This compares to the 1960s, when studies show the average was closer to 8.5 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on this shift in sleeping patterns, Ms Bates says: 'Less sleep is significantly tied with obesity and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Low sleep causes increased hunger hormones so you're going to feel a lot more hungry the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also increases our preferences for sweet foods and it increases our preferences for larger portion sizes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritionist blames technology for hampering peoples' ability to sleep, with more distractions at nighttime in the form of things such as laptops, TVs and phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'Plus people were more active throughout the day which meant that they were more tired and actually did want to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to set bed times again for ourselves because there are so many different temptations to stay up late whether it be like binge watching a Netflix show or just scrolling on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to actually set time limits for when we're going to be going to sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 23:56:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOdFhFUThlSHFNM2FzUUZxZ3JsRVptMTJDbXdEWl94MU5iYzJjcnc5UktybUxTSWRqQjQ3Wm15N2JCWnJ0ZmdULU5UTDd1V2RmWEsyRFpfeG9NU1liNW1MS0dxT1dGbDBYV3NSMUJHWkV6S0tyY0ZfTDhCUFZiUlVYVzJEbnE2MklMYzFfc0VwZUU2TkFjYW81VEJYUWZQZnc4N0tGQlVrUU8xYWfSAbABQVVfeXFMUHJyTlpxZk9Xa2tSTWUwZ1lmc1RfUzN4N0JYN3dkdDJ2el9INGtJa3pVSWVZbEdTaUpCblVDWXRyTmxlRUdzb1c3X3hsV2Vock84TVF2M0w3azM0OERYNnVaZkt0a0hubjJ0bTJfLVhjdGRhenUxZE5DQkpGeGVqdjhMcDhNTm5OM1Q5RU9JQTlobjZTZUVBY3NfVU5MYWh0SHRCa0xFNGhaMGFmMzFsSlM</guid></item><item><title>模仿胃旁路手术的“黄金时代”减肥药被誉为“奇迹” -据说比-每日邮报 | 'Golden age' weight-loss pill that mimics gastric bypass op is hailed a 'miracle' - and said to be better than - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxQMGpPN1VtWDR4bmpocVJWcUVSLWNodW9aY1Uxd2d0YlN5VWtCemlCZXMtYWE3VW1WTmtMZnpvN2U5NU96R3RjamctcTJMQ0lnNi10dzdmZ3JuNktGT0Nkb1NFbHllRzJwQk9aaXZZQWNFYlhvWjV6RHlTbTA0VkpGX2x3SmF3UjdSam1ZSzBEci1xc1JfcC1IRUZTY2VVejRMbEZxOHowamVvQ3BXVnJ5OUkyRC1RNUVPMjJ0WHhsWEt4TzlCU1B4U1dQWGppQ2lqTUVGal9FSlBoUDlqUlHSAeMBQVVfeXFMTTJveXBoMDg5ejlFcm1LclNTRGNYMWUzXzhOWTRmWW5YdWYwRnVvNWRyc1dNVGlVdk4xcWl5Nmc3TUljdzZoVTUzMncwRUoxaVJvX2E0dzJmYW5OSEI4aFlaOUdPV21YeG55U3hobHRSRWp1dG5vSUlGRGl1VmxJZHpLTWNTeW1UTVhRcFY1aTZpNXE0bFE3VlhpaVhWRlJDdXpXS2RNWURKQTgwem5XNm5rS2RyQ1JTZGwxcWZTWVZmTkNneEtNTmh4NURSWDdhQ1plVDdPNE9RWWNsSVZkZTF1c0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pill that mimics the effect of a gastric bypass has been touted as the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-94267480-3015-11f0-bfb9-b1b1020dc83a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; miracle – and may even be more effective than fat jabs in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, &lt;a target="_self" href="/galleries/article-13336623/All-surprising-health-benefits-Ozempic.html"&gt;including having fewer side effects and being easier to take&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also far safer and less invasive than actual gastric bypass surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rahul Dhanda, chief executive of Syntis Bio, makers of the pill, said: ‘The problem is [fat jabs] are not very tolerable and patients want to come off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘You want to have a long-term maintenance therapy, and an oral pill is the rational choice because it’s simple, tolerable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What we’re seeing now is patients and clinics being more focused on having something safe and sustainable to keep on a manageable, sustainable weight-loss path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I anticipate the side effects to be minimal to none, and we haven’t seen any yet in human tests. That is because it doesn’t enter the bloodstream like injections do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s a mechanical molecule, so it’s like we’re inserting a stent, as opposed to a drug that is acting with the target, and also off the target.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By binding to the mucous membrane lining of the duodenum - the top of the intestine near the stomach - the pills create a barrier that stops calories being absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forces food directly into the lower part of the digestive system, the pills set off a ‘cascade’ of hormones including GLP-1, the same chemical mimicked by semaglutide jab Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also causes the body to stop producing ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry, and start producing leptin, which makes you feel satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person taking the pill feels full more quickly and stops eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The coating created by the pill sheds naturally after about 24 hours, leaving no trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect is similar to gastric bypass, in which surgeons make the stomach smaller and shorten the small intestine, changing how the body absorbs food and leaving people feeling fuller after eating less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rats, the drug caused the animals to lose 1 per cent of their bodyweight per week while preserving 100 per cent of their lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials in humans have not studied weight loss but found the pills cause no harmful side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they prove effective in further trials, the pills could help patients maintain a healthy weight after intensive weight-loss with jabs, or replace the injections entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louis Aronne of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City told the conference that a 'golden age' of treatment had begun with these new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/golden-age-of-medicine-weight-loss-drugs-seen-as-key-to-longer-life-3wblnx3j6"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; reported he was pushing for health providers, including the NHS, to 'roll them out at scale', addding: 'I think use of drugs like this will prevent the need for many other medications, procedures, and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are just beginning to see in how many ways they can help.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 22:50:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长时间工作？新研究表明，这可能会改变你的大脑结构- CNN | Working long hours?

            The &lt;a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2025/05/08/oemed-2025-110057" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday, found “significant changes” in the brains of people who were overworking, which is a combination of physical and emotional overexertion, as well as a lack of rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya0009356m2wbnhb8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research was conducted by two scientists at South Korea’s Chung-Ang University and Yonsei University, who followed 110 healthcare workers classified into “overworked” and “non-overworked” groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000a356md6no8rzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Korea, where 52 hours of work per week is the legal upper limit, overworking has become &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6620743/" target="_blank"&gt;a public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000b356mzotb81sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overworked group, clocking 52 hours or more each week, consisted of 32 people who were on average younger, in employment for less time and more highly educated in comparison to those working standard hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000c356mug6owkyr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By comparing data from a different study and MRI scans, the researchers were able to use a neuroimaging technique to analyse the workers’ brain volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000d356m4qcts19f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The technique allowed them to identify and compare differences in levels of gray matter in different regions of the brain, while the application of atlas-based analysis meant they could identify and label structures in brain scans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000e356m18f4j7t8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who worked 52 or more hours a week displayed significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation, unlike participants who worked standard hours,” researchers said in a press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000f356m8q4b14px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Areas of the brain that showed an increase in volume include the middle frontal gyrus, which plays a major role in cognitive functions, attention, memory and language-related processes, as well as the insula, which is involved in emotional processing, self-awareness and understanding social context.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000g356mptrml15a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers believe their findings suggest a “potential relationship” between having an increased workload and changes in these parts of the brain, providing a biological basis for the cognitive and emotional challenges reported by people who are overworked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000h356mhae9cxgb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Joon Yul Choi, coauthor of the study and an assistant professor at Yonsei University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, told CNN that these changes might be “at least in part, reversible” if environmental stressors are reversed. Still, returning to your brain’s baseline state could take much longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Previous research has also found evidence of the negative health impacts of long working hours. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/17/success/who-long-hours-intl-scli-wellness"&gt;joint research&lt;/a&gt; from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that overworking led to more than 745,000 deaths in a year. Long hours have also been found to raise the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/health/diabetes-long-hours-women-study"&gt;diabetes in women&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/169/5/596/143020?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;decline in cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000k356milxe0w01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While these behavioral and psychological consequences of overwork are well-known, the underlying neurological mechanisms and changes in anatomy are less understood, the study explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000l356m2jegopb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank Pega, who led the WHO-ILO 2021 study, told CNN that these latest findings constitute “important new evidence” that could help better understand how long working hours “radically” impact the physical health of workers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000m356mphkict47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pega, a WHO technical officer who was not involved in this latest study, said the research supports WHO-ILO’s findings that “long working hours contribute the largest burden of disease of all occupational risk factors identified so far.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000n356mlo6unjiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the study’s small sample size and focus only on healthcare workers in South Korea makes it hard to generalize its results. “More studies in different populations are needed,” said Pega.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000o356mcpxihzin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study, they represent a meaningful first step in understanding the relationship between overwork and brain health,” said the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000p356m5nekepqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for anyone stuck working long hours? Now you might have a scientific basis to cut down on your time at work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000q356miixgw6sl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Governments, employers, and workers can all take actions to protect workers’ health from long working hours,” advised Pega, citing laws, regulations and policies that can ensure healthy work hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000r356mlkcvu32u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The results underscore the importance of addressing overwork as an occupational health concern,” said the study’s authors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000s356mn504erzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jonny Gifford, principal research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies in Brighton, England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the research “confirms some physiological reasons that working long hours affects our wellbeing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000t356mf004rovd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of brain scanning equipment to give neurological explanations gives powerful new evidence linking overwork with structural changes in parts of the brain involved in executive function and emotional regulation,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000u356m2rvzltx8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a small study of 110 healthcare workers in Korea, but because it is based on robust neurological measures and concerns fundamental mechanisms (overwork and fatigue) that can affect anyone, the central findings are widely relevant,” Gifford added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000v356m24m9pca6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study was published in the journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed health data from over 142,000 adults and found that certain multimorbidity profiles more than doubled the chance of a depression diagnosis within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with joint or bone issues and individuals with chronic lung, liver, or bowel conditions were also at elevated risk. The findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Risk Combinations:&lt;/strong&gt; Cardiometabolic diseases like heart disease and diabetes greatly increase depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Women with arthritis or joint issues are especially vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Shift Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrated care can better address physical and mental health together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with multiple long-term physical health conditions are at a significantly greater risk of developing depression, a study shows.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that some combinations of illnesses – particularly cardiometabolic ones like diabetes and heart disease – could more than double the likelihood of a future depression diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multimorbidity – when patients live with two or more chronic conditions – continuing to put pressure on an already stretched healthcare system, experts say the findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109901"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-chronic-illness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Edinburgh used data from more than 142,000 people in the UK Biobank study to examine how physical illnesses interact to influence the risk of depression – a condition that often goes underdiagnosed in people managing long-term physical diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were aged 37-73 years and had at least one chronic physical condition but no history of depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists used statistical clustering techniques to group individuals by their physical illness profiles and tracked how these clusters related to later diagnoses of depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group, which included people experiencing the highest rates of physical illness also showed the highest risk of developing depression. This group had no single dominant illness, but rather a complex mix of issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with both heart disease and diabetes were also found to be at high risk, as were those with chronic lung conditions like asthma or COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Liver and bowel conditions also showed a noticeable link to depression in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the highest-risk groups, about one in 12 people developed depression over the next 10 years, compared with about one in 25 people without physical conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the biological burden of illness may play a role, researchers say social and systemic factors could also help explain why physical multimorbidity leads to worse mental health outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren DeLong, lead author and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said: “We saw clear associations between physical health conditions and the development of depression, but this study is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our findings inspire other researchers to investigate and untangle the links between physical and mental health conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice at the University of Edinburgh’s Advanced Care Research Centre, said: “Healthcare often treats physical and mental health as completely different things, but this study shows that we need to get better at anticipating and managing depression in people with physical illness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR’s Scientific Director of Innovation, said: “Harnessing the power of data to understand the impact of chronic conditions is going to transform the way we treat patients in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NIHR’s research in this area is helping to paint a full picture of what patients are dealing with, rather than just focusing on one health condition at a time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this health and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a4b6baeda2b7a8aaadb0acad83a6a7eda2a0edb6a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guy Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Guy Atkinson – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-00825-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Lauren DeLong et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more conditions within an individual, is a growing challenge for health and care delivery as well as for research. Combinations of physical and mental health conditions are highlighted as particularly important. Here, we investigated associations between physical multimorbidity and subsequent depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a clustering analysis upon physical morbidity data for UK Biobank participants aged 37–73. Of 502,353 participants, 142,005 had linked general practice data with at least one baseline physical condition. Following stratification by sex (77,785 women; 64,220 men), we used four clustering methods and selected the best-performing based on clustering metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Fisher’s Exact test to determine significant over-/under-representation of conditions within each cluster. Amongst people with no prior depression, we used survival analysis to estimate associations between cluster-membership and time to subsequent depression diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-modes models perform best, and the over-/under-represented conditions in the resultant clusters reflect known associations. For example, clusters containing an overrepresentation of cardiometabolic conditions are amongst the largest (15.5% of whole cohort, 19.7% of women, 24.2% of men).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cluster associations with depression vary from hazard ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.85–1.98) to 2.67 (2.24–3.17), but almost all clusters show a higher association with depression than those without physical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that certain groups of physical multimorbidity may be associated with a higher risk of subsequent depression.

Researchers used high-resolution electrocorticography in 48 patients to reveal that semantic processing and articulatory planning occur in neighboring yet functionally distinct regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key discovery was the involvement of a dorsal prefrontal hub in mapping sound to meaning, particularly in natural auditory naming tasks. These findings could improve treatment for language disorders and support future innovations in brain-computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Word retrieval relies on separate semantic and articulatory networks in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditory Specialization:&lt;/strong&gt; A dorsal hub links sound to meaning—crucial for spoken language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may guide therapies for speech disorders and brain-computer communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are we able to recall a word we want to say? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basic ability, called word retrieval, is often compromised in patients with brain damage. Interestingly, many patients who can name words they see, like identifying a pet in the room as a “cat”, struggle with retrieving words in everyday discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain retrieves words during speech. A new study by researchers at New York University sheds light on this mystery, revealing a left-lateralized network in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that plays a crucial role in naming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, provide new insights into the neural architecture of language, offering potential applications for both neuroscience and clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Brain’s Naming Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word retrieval is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing us to link concepts to language. Despite decades of research, the exact neural dynamics underlying this process — particularly in natural auditory contexts — remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYU researchers — led by Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Leyao Yu and Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Tandon and Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Adeen Flinker — recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 48 neurosurgical patients to examine the spatial and temporal organization of language processing in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using unsupervised clustering techniques, the researchers identified two distinct but overlapping networks responsible for word retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, a semantic processing network, was located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was engaged in integrating meaning and was sensitive to how surprising a word was within a given sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second, an articulatory planning network, was situated in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which played a crucial role in speech production, regardless of whether words were presented visually or auditorily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditory Naming and the Prefrontal Cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds upon decades of work in language neuroscience. Previous research suggested that different regions of the brain were responsible for retrieving words depending on whether they were seen or heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, earlier studies relied on methods with limited temporal resolution, leaving many unanswered questions about how these networks interact in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of ECoG, the researchers uncovered a striking ventral-dorsal gradient in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that while articulatory planning was localized ventrally, semantic processing was uniquely represented in a dorsal region of the inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus — a previously underappreciated hub for language processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that a missing piece in our understanding of language processing lies in this dorsal prefrontal region,” explains lead author Leyao Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides the first direct evidence that this area is involved in mapping sounds to meaning in an auditory context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Neuroscience and Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has far-reaching implications, not only for theoretical neuroscience but also for clinical applications. Language deficits, such as anomia — the inability to retrieve words — are common in stroke, brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the precise neural networks involved in word retrieval could lead to better diagnostics and targeted rehabilitation therapies for patients suffering from these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study provides a roadmap for future research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By decoding the neural signals associated with naming, scientists could potentially develop assistive devices for individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively through direct brain-computer communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, one thing is clear: our ability to name the world around us is not just a simple act of recall, but the result of a sophisticated and finely tuned neural system — one that is now being revealed in greater detail than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this auditory neuroscience and language research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97fbf2f6ffb9e4f4fffaf2e5fbd7f9eee2b9f2f3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Schmerl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Schmerl – NYU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming&lt;/a&gt;” by Leyao Yu et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this process relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded neurosurgical electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space, critical for word retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was invariant to input modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the processing of semantic auditory inputs ranging from passive language comprehension to conversational speech.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 21:18:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBnSHFuYW9MVTZqV2Z5QmlnMnF2M2Y4eHBoeEhxZVc3ZWdCSk83MDNCeU9uRTREajFzOS1nZkVVS2kyQWhUN0FxUUtLUFVXOWdlQU9CZEdTeWZuX3NDMzVEbDlnQ01kLVU2TEE</guid></item><item><title>研究将异常体验与潜意识联系和其他心理特征联系起来- PsyPost | Study links anomalous experiences to subconscious connectedness and other psychological traits - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFdJeXJBdEJxLWh6SmNCSjBYUmlVeXUzZFJxSzQ4R0tnY1gxWkhfQkZ3RHJDREdTeFBRaFVsWnk4Vkl0cUhaR2gyTDFnX1RQRDkzUWpvaVlXRnprcHpFRkJ3UG9KaFBoV0p3U0FSa2FYRE1LeEhGZmhYQXcyM1F0YUtCTEpkMzYtbWNJcE5QZlBHQ1RWWm10a3pSU0ktTWxmMU9OQ3dpdy1BYVc5M2xMWVVhYXhWd3hkU3Bv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new series of studies suggests that unusual experiences like premonitions, déjà vu, and out-of-body sensations are not rare, but instead quite common—and that people who report them often share distinct psychological traits. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-07062-001?doi=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that individuals high in a trait called subconscious connectedness were significantly more likely to report frequent anomalous experiences. These experiences were also associated with traits such as dissociation, magical thinking, absorption, and intuitive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anomalous experiences are events that seem to go beyond what conventional science can explain. These include extrasensory perceptions, vivid or unusual dreams, perceived telepathic events, or an unexplained sense of presence. While such experiences are often dismissed as illusions or signs of mental illness, some researchers argue that they are widespread in the general population and deserve more scientific attention. The new study was designed to better understand what kinds of people are more likely to report such experiences and how those experiences might be related to underlying psychological traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been formally studying the personality trait of subconscious connectedness for several years. It is a line of research that indicates that some people have a much closer connection with the non-conscious or subconscious parts of their mind than other people; meaning that their consciousness and their subconscious mind influence each other to an unusually high degree in their everyday life,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/gi/people/olafur-s-palsson-psyd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Olafur S. Palsson&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be measured with a questionnaire called the Thought Impact Scale, which I developed and validated. By using scores on that scale, people can be reliably divided into those with high, moderate, and low subconscious connectedness. It is a personality characteristic that is normally distributed in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having high subconscious connectedness seems to be associated with a range of specific personal tendencies and behaviors, and I have been investigating those systematically in several studies,” Palsson explained. “These side effects, so to speak, of high subconscious connectedness include greater proneness to engage regularly in creative or artistic activities, higher hypnotizability and being more likely to seek hypnosis treatment, and greater probability of experiencing certain stress-related physical health problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and migraine headaches. A tendency to have a lot of unusual life experiences is another characteristic that I have long suspected to be associated with high subconscious connectedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anomalous experiences are a broad and heterogenous class of phenomena that simply have in common that they are things that people sometimes experience that are outside the conventional framework of understanding of how the world operates. I noticed many years ago that clients in my practice as a clinical psychologist who showed indications of high subconscious connectedness seemed to spontaneously report various anomalous experiences more commonly than my other clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, they more often described being able to sense the thoughts of other people, having predictive dreams, experiencing highly improbable and very meaningful synchronicities, or having out-of-body experiences,” Palsson continued. “This observation led me to conduct a series of three studies to examine whether greater proneness to anomalous experiences is indeed a side effect of having high subconscious connectedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson conducted three separate studies involving over 2,200 adults in the United States. The first study was a pilot involving 216 participants from a university community. The second and third studies were large, demographically balanced online surveys conducted with nationwide samples—500 people in Study 2 and 1,500 people in Study 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three studies used the newly developed Unusual Experiences Questionnaire, which asks people about 13 types of anomalous experiences and how often they occur. Examples include sensing someone is watching you before you turn around, having predictive dreams, or noticing meaningful coincidences that seem too unlikely to be chance. The team also used the Thought Impact Scale to assess the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson found that people with high subconscious connectedness reported more anomalous experiences than those with low scores on the Thought Impact Scale. In all three studies, the difference between high and low scorers was not just statistically significant—it was large. For example, in the nationally representative Study 3, people with high Thought Impact Scale scores reported, on average, more than three times as many repeated anomalous experiences as those with low scores. In fact, 86% of participants in that survey said they had experienced at least one of the anomalous events more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between Thought Impact Scale scores and the amount of anomalous experiences was moderate to strong across all three studies (r = .53 to .69). Moreover, every single one of the 13 experiences listed in the Unusual Experiences Questionnaire was more common among people with high subconscious connectedness—ranging from déjà vu to feeling their thoughts had influenced other people’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was to see how many adults have certain anomalous experiences again and again,” Palsson told PsyPost. “The most common of these repeated experiences was déjà-vu — that is, the sense that what one is experiencing in the present moment has happened before, when that is not possible. About sixty percent of people in the U.S. national population samples reported having had déjà-vu at least a few times. And between forty and fifty percent of all the people surveyed reported that they had at least a few times sensed correctly being stared at before looking, having had premonition that came true, and objects oddly disappearing and showing up later in places where they had already looked for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person having any such peculiar experience once can perhaps be dismissed as misperception or imagination. But to see that a large proportion of the general population experiences particular anomalies again and again over time is eye-opening to me, and suggests that these phenomena warrant far more research. Most surveys of anomalous experiences have unfortunately only asked whether people have ever experienced what is described, but not how often it occurs. That is a mistake, I think. For if some subjective experience happens repeatedly over time, it is a psychological tendency, and likely says something about the mind of the person who has that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But subconscious connectedness wasn’t the only trait linked to these experiences. In the first and third studies, Palsson also measured several other personality traits previously associated with anomalous experiences. These included absorption (becoming fully immersed in thoughts or sensory experiences), dissociation (feeling detached from oneself), fantasy proneness, faith in intuition, magical ideation (the belief that one’s thoughts can influence the world), and belief in paranormal phenomena. All of these traits showed significant associations with the number of anomalous experiences participants reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson also explored how these experiences relate to mental health and well-being. People who reported more anomalous experiences tended to report more stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. However, the correlations were modest. The number of anomalous experiences was only weakly related to lower happiness and had no clear relationship with perceived quality of life. These findings suggest that while unusual experiences may be more common in individuals with higher emotional distress, they are not necessarily impairing or distressing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic patterns also emerged. Across the two national surveys, younger adults reported more anomalous experiences than older adults. The highest prevalence was found in participants under 50 years old, while people over 65 reported the fewest. Some racial and ethnic differences were also found: in the third study, Black participants reported more anomalous experiences than white participants, while Hispanic participants fell in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are two important points that emerge from this work for the general public,” Palsson explained. “The first is that anomalous experiences are actually very common. They tend to be dismissed as exceptions or rare events, but the findings indicate that they are a normal part of human life experience. The series of three studies that I describe in the paper that was just published is the most comprehensive investigation carried out so far on anomalous experiences in the U.S. general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two of the studies were nationwide surveys of nationally representative samples of adults. Both of those population studies showed that about four out of every five American adults have at least one kind of anomalous experience repeatedly, and in fact, most of them have multiple different kinds of such odd experiences again and again. In my view, this suggests that having anomalous experiences is something that should be considered to be a part of our natural psychological makeup as human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second important takeaway from this research, I think, is that people vary greatly in regard to the extent to which they have odd life experiences,” Palssons said. “Proneness to have anomalous experiences is most likely a stable personal characteristic over time, and is probably determined in large part by how much people’s conscious and subconscious minds communicate with each other in everyday life. What this means is that if you are a person who frequently has anomalous experiences, and you have a friend who rarely or never has such experiences, that particular difference between you will probably still be there years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson cautions that while the findings are robust, they do not prove that subconscious connectedness causes anomalous experiences. It is possible that both are influenced by other underlying factors, or that people who are more open to experiences are simply more likely to notice or recall unusual events. Another limitation is that the Unusual Experiences Questionnaire does not cover all possible anomalous experiences—such as religious visions, communication with the dead, or UFO encounters—so the findings may not apply to those domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main limitation of this research is that I used a short questionnaire in the three survey studies to measure anomalous experiences,” Palsson noted. “It is therefore unclear whether the findings apply to all types of anomalous experiences. For example, we cannot know for sure whether seeing ghosts is related to being high on the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, because my surveys did not ask people whether or how often they have seen ghosts. However, because all thirteen types of anomalous experiences that were measured in my surveys showed a robust association with high subconscious connectedness, it seems likely that other such experiences are also more common for people with high scores on that trait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope their findings will encourage more scientific attention to these experiences and promote a better understanding of their psychological roots. Whether or not anomalous experiences reflect hidden aspects of reality or just the quirks of the human mind, they appear to be deeply woven into how many people experience the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I continue to actively pursue research to enhance understanding of the effects of having high, or low, subconscious connectedness,” Palsson said. “In regard to anomalous experiences, future studies will aim to examine what specific cognitive differences related to high subconscious connectedness result in proneness to have anomalous experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cns0000428" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Anomalous Experiences Are Associated With High Subconscious Connectedness&lt;/a&gt;,” was published April 17, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 21:15:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFdJeXJBdEJxLWh6SmNCSjBYUmlVeXUzZFJxSzQ4R0tnY1gxWkhfQkZ3RHJDREdTeFBRaFVsWnk4Vkl0cUhaR2gyTDFnX1RQRDkzUWpvaVlXRnprcHpFRkJ3UG9KaFBoV0p3U0FSa2FYRE1LeEhGZmhYQXcyM1F0YUtCTEpkMzYtbWNJcE5QZlBHQ1RWWm10a3pSU0ktTWxmMU9OQ3dpdy1BYVc5M2xMWVVhYXhWd3hkU3Bv</guid></item><item><title>伊利诺伊州快速命中：西尼罗河病毒阳性检测；检测到耐药真菌-中心广场 | Illinois quick hits: Positive test for West Nile virus; drug-resistant fungus detected - The Center Square</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPajdQMWFtblhLN3lpWjUxS2tuLWhwYmdyMUlILXNkazYyck9SQ1hOMEhoNm0zRjZCVVhjc2JPNE9zRGlwNU9MdzlXenRKLTFzZV9CQ3BOY0NCWE8tSGhQSmFXN2J4STM0ODZIVGpUNVZCLVE0S1c1b1lqUVczVE9nSHlkSFpHREtTTHB5MXJNXzdNc0dB0gGaAUFVX3lxTE1KVFFHemFYbFZZSTBvYloyX29Dc0RqdGRuRzU2SlZWVEl1cXZvTHViSi1ISkJqTUt4TmJlWGYtMU9iMzRUcG9fdlMzR09DbjAzdjlLU040MHM0Y1AxZXlWSkhiMkl4YTA2c25PNVZWYzdHNmI0X21kQmw0ejVpdThkdVlKV2JrUkpwN3NkcTUtQnRjUmpkbVFVaUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;People may be paying a hidden price for living close to a golf course. Recent research has found a link between golf courses and greater odds of developing Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Mayo Clinic and others conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Network Open. They found that people who lived in close proximity to golf courses had a higher risk of Parkinson’s than similar residents who lived farther away. The researchers argue that the pesticides used to maintain these courses are likely a major reason behind the connection—an argument that other experts are taking seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This study is a wake-up call.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; is a neurodegenerative condition that progressively worsens people’s motor function (in the later stages, it &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/parkinsons-disease/parkinsons-disease-and-dementia#:~:text=Parkinson%20disease%20causes%20physical%20symptoms,it%20hard%20to%20maintain%20relationships."&gt;often affects cognition&lt;/a&gt; as well). It’s &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/about-us/news/2025-parkinsons-awareness-month"&gt;thought to affect nearly a million Americans&lt;/a&gt; today, with almost 100,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Most cases are thought to be caused by a complex mix of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/study-genetic-trigger-parkinsons-disease-african-1850871175"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; and environmental factors, which can include exposure to toxins like pesticides. Past studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722079542?via%3Dihub"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that living or working next to areas where pesticides are routinely applied is linked to a higher risk for Parkinson’s. But according to the study researchers, there hasn’t been much work done to understand the potential risk of living near golf courses specifically.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors used data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, established by the Mayo Clinic and others in 1966. The project has followed the health of residents in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin for many years, including whether they were ever diagnosed with Parkinson’s. They compared people in the project who were diagnosed with Parkinson’s between 1991 and 2015 to controls matched in age and sex, in what’s known as a case-control study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The closer that someone lived to one of the 139 golf courses located in the regions covered by the project (or who shared water services with a golf course), the more likely they were to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s, the researchers found. After accounting for other factors, they calculated that living within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of a golf course was associated with a 126% increase in risk of Parkinson’s compared to people who lived six or more miles (9 km) away. Residents who shared water services with a golf course also had almost twice the odds of developing Parkinson’s as those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is an important and well-designed population-based study that adds meaningful data to our growing understanding of environmental contributors to Parkinson’s disease,” Michael S. Okun, national medical advisor for the Parkinson’s Foundation, who is not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okun, who is also the director of the Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, cautions that this study cannot show a causative link between golf course proximity and a higher risk of Parkinson’s. But he notes that certain common pesticides, such as paraquat, maneb, and chlorpyrifos, are known to be toxic to the brain, and some research has linked their use to &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/blog/awareness/CSO-update"&gt;increased Parkinson’s cases&lt;/a&gt;. Since golf courses require “intensive chemical maintenance,” he adds, it’s biologically plausible that these chemicals can contaminate the local water supply or otherwise reach people in the surrounding area and raise their Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Svjetlana Miocinovic, an associate professor in the Department of Neurology at Emory University’s School of Medicine, also wasn’t surprised by the study’s results, though she notes that this shouldn’t be the last word on the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The study was done in one geographic region so results need to be replicated in a larger cohort and other geographic areas, but the study highlights the importance of environmental factors in Parkinson’s disease,” Miocinovic, who is not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While more work is needed to understand the exact risks posed by golf courses and accompanying pesticide use, Okun argues that we know enough to take action already by limiting people’s exposures to these chemicals whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study is a wake-up call,” he said. “Parkinson’s disease is the world’s fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder, and we are spending pennies on the dollar for prevention. The real takeaway here is that we need to stop viewing Parkinson’s as an inevitable consequence of aging and start treating it as a potentially preventable condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                A universal vaccine against flu wouldn't have to be updated to match seasonal changes in circulating strains.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine experts are perplexed by a project the Trump administration has launched to develop a universal flu vaccine, which has long been a goal, though an elusive one, in medical research. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Gold Standard&lt;/a&gt;, the project is aimed at creating a flu shot that doesn't have to be updated every year to match the latest strains of the virus. The project also aims to produce a vaccine that could protect people against other respiratory viruses that could cause a pandemic, such as bird flu and coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift," said National Institutes of Heath Director Jay Bhattacharya in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the project. "It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats — not just today's, but tomorrow's as well — using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The announcement surprised vaccine researchers, given the anti-vaccine stance of health officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm glad to see that this administration is still wanting to invest in developing next-generation influenza vaccines or respiratory vaccines in general," says &lt;a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/florida/ross/" target="_blank"&gt;Ted Ross&lt;/a&gt;, director of Global Vaccine Development at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An old vaccine technology back in the spotlight&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Ross and other outside vaccine experts are mystified by many aspects of Generation Gold Standard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First of all, the project plans to use an approach that would involve injecting people with a whole flu virus that has been killed with a chemical to render it harmless but is still capable of stimulating the immune system. Most vaccine experts consider the whole killed virus approach to be antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This a head-scratcher to me. This is puzzling," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.atria.org/doctors/dr-gregory-a-poland/" target="_blank"&gt;Gregory Poland&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine expert who leads the Atria Academy of Science and Medicine in New York.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're going back to technology that was used 40, 50 years ago or more. So this is a little surprising to me why you would go backwards to this technology? It's a very old technology," Poland says. "This is what influenza vaccines in the 40s, 50s and 60s looked like."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Whole dead virus vaccines tend to produce more side effects, including high fevers and seizures that especially can frighten parents, Poland, Ross and others say. Newer, more advanced technologies are showing more promise with fewer side effects, they say. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccines. We have recombinant influenza vaccines. We have an mRNA-based influenza vaccine," Poland says. "So why would you put all your eggs in one basket?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A pricey bet on a single approach&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And then there's the price tag: $500 million, which is a huge amount, especially at a time when federal health research funding is being slashed. The money that was originally earmarked to help explore a variety of technologies for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This amount of money is astronomical. It is foolish to put that much money onto one technology," says &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/author/rick-bright" target="_blank"&gt;Rick Bright,&lt;/a&gt; a former federal vaccine expert who is now a private consultant. "What we need now is bold 21st century solutions, not a retreat into nostalgia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another aspect that's raising eyebrows is the fact that the technology — called a "beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform" — was developed by two NIH scientists — Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/matthew-j-memoli-md-ms" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Memoli&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. &lt;a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/jeffery-taubenberger" target="_blank"&gt;Jeffery Tautenberger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Memoli was recently named as the principal deputy director of the NIH after serving as Trump's acting NIH director. Tautenberger was recently named acting director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Tautenberger holds a &lt;a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11369675" target="_blank"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; on the technology. In addition, the strategy was picked without independent, public review and based on only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11779107/" target="_blank"&gt;very limited&lt;/a&gt; preliminary testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So that's odd," says Dr.  &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine expert who's now at Georgetown University. "If you're going to do this, have an open scientific competition for the best ideas. There should be transparency for the process of how to allot funding."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cost of the project and answered a question about the two vaccine candidates being explored, but didn't answer additional questions from NPR about the project, including why officials picked this approach and how the effort was vetted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in announcing it, the administration said a universal flu vaccine should be ready for widescale testing next year and could be available to the public within four years, which is a very ambitious timeline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed," the announcement says.

Low-ranking male mice showed stronger reward signals and weaker control circuits, making them more prone to seek methamphetamine, while high-ranking mice had better balance and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the mesocortical “control” pathway through optogenetics reduced drug-seeking and improved social rank, suggesting experience-based changes can reshape addiction risk. Interestingly, these effects were sex-specific, with female mice showing drug-seeking behavior regardless of status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circuit Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low social rank is linked to stronger reward signals and weaker executive control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Winning experiences elevated social rank and reduced drug-seeking in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Findings:&lt;/strong&gt; Female addiction behavior was not influenced by social rank.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug addiction poses a global public health challenge, with limited therapeutic options and modest efficacy. While numerous studies have shown that social status profoundly impacts mental health and addiction susceptibility, its neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, however, a research team led by Prof. ZHU Yingjie from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed the neural mechanisms by which social rank influences vulnerability to drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109885"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a head and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on May 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a suite of cutting-edge neuroscience tools such as fiber photometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetic manipulation, and volumetric imaging, the researchers explored both functional and structural differences in the dopamine systems of male rodents occupying different social ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools allowed them to measure real-time neuronal activity, detect rapid chemical changes (particularly dopamine), manipulate neural circuits with light, and capture high-speed 3D images of brain activity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that an animal’s social rank influences its tendency to seek methamphetamine (METH) by affecting the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways—two key dopamine pathways in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic pathway delivers dopamine to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and promotes reward-seeking behavior, whereas the mesocortical pathway, which projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and supports executive control, helping suppress compulsive drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low-ranking mice exhibit a stronger ‘reward’ circuit and a weaker ‘control’ circuit —like a high-powered car with faulty brakes—making them more likely to seek drugs. In contrast, high-ranking mice have a more balanced system, with effective ‘brakes’ that help them resist addiction,” explained Prof. ZHU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dopamine-related proteins in the NAc of low-ranking male mice were reduced, their METH-seeking behavior declined. In contrast, when dopamine fibers in the mPFC of high-ranking male mice were damaged, drug-seeking behavior increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strikingly, activating the mesocortical dopamine pathway via optogenetic stimulation not only made the mice win a social competition test more often; it also made them much less likely to seek METH in subsequent trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the study also found that these effects were sex-specific: Female mice exhibited METH-seeking behavior regardless of social rank, suggesting different neurobiological underpinning of addiction risk in male and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that introducing winning experiences to low-ranking male mice not only elevated their social rank but also reduced later drug-seeking behavior. These behavioral changes were linked to functional and structural remodeling in both the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel neurobiological framework linking social status, dopamine circuit dynamics, and addiction vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By boosting an individual’s sense of social achievement or simulating successful experiences, it may be possible—at the neural level—to ‘strengthen the brakes and ease off the accelerator,’ thereby reducing addiction risk,” said Prof. ZHU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that the study also supports the development of non-invasive stimulation therapies aimed at reducing addiction vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and addiction research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5021253e7e3c2510233931247e31337e333e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LU Qun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://siat.ac.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;LU Qun – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01951-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways&lt;/a&gt;” by ZHU Yingjie et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social status has a profound impact on mental health and propensity towards drug addiction. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:26:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBvb0piRGk4RDhUbXBoQU5DN2ZlODExb1FteHppNXk1b256QmFEWmpYR0prNXA5Zno2dUZNamxidnVpNnA2TlBKNno1UmZ2QkszNlFSUlF6UVQ0ZFZSQl9SdzJvaU9VdkxRMVpyWGNIZGRCT3pi</guid></item><item><title>两性之间的蛋白质差异并非都是遗传的-神经科学新闻 | Protein Differences Between Sexes Aren’t All Genetic - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE4xay0ybEw0dmxHUmRWWm14eDZLcGI5cGp0c1FtRlFOSVVaOFljQWNfNTVBQVI3VGZVNF9MTEJKZnBpZnBEbHNvakNiZ2NaeXVXeUNKRnVhbXd6QVZTWTRROFllOHN0OXpQRGhxMGwzemEyUHdkbnNGYQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;An international study of 6,000 proteins across 56,000 people found that while protein levels differ significantly between males and females, most of these differences are not caused by genetics. Only about 100 proteins showed sex-specific genetic regulation, suggesting that environmental, hormonal, and lifestyle factors play a major role in shaping health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge the assumption that genetic differences alone explain sex-based health disparities. The study highlights the need for a broader approach to personalized medicine that includes both biological and social determinants of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Two-thirds of proteins differed in levels between sexes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few Genetic Causes:&lt;/strong&gt; Only ~100 proteins showed sex-specific genetic regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Genetics:&lt;/strong&gt; Environment, lifestyle, and access to resources may drive health differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Queen Mary University London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results of an international study led by researchers from Queen Mary University of London’s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) shed new light the underlying biological mechanisms which cause differences in health risks, symptoms and outcomes between males and females.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, carried out in collaboration with the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from UK Biobank and the Fenland study, the team carried an in-depth analysis of the genetic links between ~6,000 proteins and hundreds of diseases in 56,000 males and females.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that for two-thirds of these proteins, their levels differed between males and females. Further examination revealed that only a very small fraction, around 100 proteins out of the 6,000 studied, had differences in the genetic ‘switches’ which control their levels, when compared between males and females.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, which may have implications for drug development, indicate that while there are differences between the sexes in relation to how much they express certain proteins, what’s causing these differences isn’t solely down to differences in their genetics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the authors highlight the importance of looking beyond genetics – and other medical factors such as hormones – when comparing health risks and outcomes between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that non-medical factors such as where people work and live, their education, financial situation, access to resources, as well as their lifestyle also contribute to the health differences experiences between the sexes and so should be explored further and considered more when exploring sex differences in health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mine Koprulu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary’s PHURI, said: “For the first time in history, we are able to study human biology at this level of detail—across genes, proteins, and more. This is the largest study to date exploring the similarities and differences in how our genetic code regulates blood protein levels between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors that impact health differences — at the genetic level and beyond— to create more tailored and equitable healthcare for everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the PHURI at Queen Mary and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Germany, said: “Drug development pipelines increasingly incorporate information on genetic differences in protein levels and function and this has led to large investment in human cohorts, such as UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this perspective, better understanding of population differences in the regulation of proteins, such as those between males and females, is essential to guide precision medicine approaches and identify where one size may not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results clearly show that with very few exceptions, protein regulating genetic variants identified so far behave in a very similar way in males and females. This provides evidence for an important implicit assumption – that insights arising from studying these variants apply to both sexes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, data was categorised as male or female based on chromosomal information (XX or XY). The authors acknowledge that chromosomal information does not always align with an individual’s gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for the purposes of this study (genetic and protein-level scientific analyses), this categorisation was necessary, and data on gender identity was not reliably recoded meaning it could not be consistently used across all data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funded by:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fenland Study (DOI 10.22025/2017.10.101.00001) is funded by the Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12015/1, Claudia Langenberg, Nicholas J.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading trade organizations representing the makers of cell and gene therapies are calling for a 10-year international moratorium on the use of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/topic/crispr/"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; and other DNA-editing tools to create genetically modified children, according to a draft of the declaration provided to STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move — coming more than seven years after &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/12/17/crispr-shocker-genome-editing-scientist-he-jiankui/"&gt;Chinese researcher He Jiankui&lt;/a&gt; announced the birth of the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/25/china-first-gene-edited-babies-born/"&gt;world’s first CRISPR babies&lt;/a&gt; — is intended to send a clear signal to the global scientific community that attempts to alter the genomes of eggs, sperm, or embryos — known as the germline — destined for live births remain unacceptable at this time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement has no legal or regulatory force, but should offer guidance as countries decide whether or how to regulate germline and other genome editing.&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond neurological effects, exposure to heavy metals has also been associated with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9d4ede80-301a-11f0-ba79-25125b88f7fd"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, kidney disease, birth defects, and cardiovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the tested products exceeded the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) limits for exposure to these toxins, though two did exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) limit, which is based on wastewater levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the concern is especially troubling because these metals can easily enter the body not only through ingestion, but also through skin absorption or by being inhaled during brushing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no known safe level of lead or mercury exposure, raising serious concerns about the long-term safety of everyday oral care products.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only five of the tested toothpastes did not contain any heavy metals, including one Orajel product made for kids: Orajel Training Toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/01/toothpaste-chart/"&gt;Lead Safe Mama founder Tamara Rubin&lt;/a&gt; called the widespread presence of these toxins in toothpaste 'unconscionable, especially in 2025.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What's really interesting to me is that no one thought this was a concern,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/toothpaste-lead-heavy-metals"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rubin said the contamination appears to stem from certain ingredients commonly used in toothpaste, such as hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and bentonite clay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hydroxyapatite, a mineral often derived from animal bones, is added to toothpaste for its potential to help teeth absorb calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Calcium carbonate — a naturally occurring compound also used as a dietary supplement — is included for its ability to remove surface stains, while bentonite clay is used for its cleaning properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Notably, the toothpastes with the highest levels of contamination contained bentonite clay, which is known to harbor heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rubin also tested samples of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate, finding that both contained alarming levels of lead and other contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Multiple toothpastes that are made specifically for children were found to contain toxic heavy metals, including those made by popular brands such as Hello, Orajel and Tom's of Maine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These ingredients tend to appear more frequently in natural or alternative toothpastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The product with the highest lead content was Primal Life Dirty Mouth Kids Tooth Powder, which exceeded the EPA exposure limits for both lead and arsenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;VanMan's Miracle Tooth Powder had the second highest lead concentration, but only exceeded the EPA limit for arsenic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The EPA states that exposure should not exceed 5,000 parts per billion (ppb) for both lead and arsenic, 200 ppb for mercury and 1,000 ppb for cadmium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the FDA's current lead limit for fluoride-free toothpastes is 10,000 ppb, and 20,000 ppb for fluoride toothpastes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead Safe Mama also tested some of the most popular toothpaste brands in the US. The chart above shows the products made by these brands that contained the highest levels of lead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three of these products — Orajel Kids Anticavity Toothpaste (Paw Patrol), Tom's of Maine Kid's Natural Toothpaste and Hello Fluoride Free Toothpaste — are made specifically for children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that the adverse health effects of heavy metals on children are much higher than in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The federal Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, which is still in the early stages of the legislative process, aims to limit lead in kids' food to 10 ppb. California's limit on lead in baby food is even more strict: six ppb.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these recommended levels may not be directly transferable to toothpaste, most of the dental products Lead Safe Mama tested exceeded them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com has reached out to the following brands or their parent companies for comment: Crest, Colgate, Orajel, Sensodyne, Tom's of Maine, Burt's Bees, Hello, Primal Life and VanMan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an emailed statement, a Crest representative said: 'All our products are safe to use and comply with all regulatory requirements and standards including those set by US Pharmacopeia (USP) and the FDA. We will not market a product until we have thoroughly evaluated its safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are aware of the report/testing published on the website Lead Safe Mama and are interested to learn more about the testing methodology as well as the findings.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the other contacted brands immediately responded to request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some companies whose products were named in this report hit back, often claiming that the levels of heavy metal contamination Lead Safe Mama found are not concerning, or that lead is found in trace levels throughout the environment and is therefore impossible to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others sent Rubin cease and desist letters, which she ignored but posted on her blog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But so far, none of the companies have said they will take action to remove heavy metals from their products.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 19:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUS1nT3dBYkNBa2FraW1FMVB1YVUyMEhuMDFaNFVDTm5Ma3ZMTTRyc3JuTTBEdnRXY1ZiRGdZREJxTEtqWE5jcU9jUWY1MG51V2s4bjFsbTRKR3kwU2dHTmFkLTZ1Q2xNaFpwMnBpSzEzUTkzRHlPUEM0OXNtR0RNd1dXdmNld1NmUU5GWU1wV0F0ZHdlbnJUcUUxMEtWN3RlQ3NaWnhJZjhJSnc</guid></item><item><title>ARL在得梅因看到高传染性犬类病毒的上升- WHO13.com | ARL sees rise in highly contagious canine virus in Des Moines - WHO13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPakJuTEc5eHNUUUFoaDBLWDFyTFFKZGJDSXYyWXFYRlBRRE5RLU16bGV5OWdCcDhkTFExY3RhN1lQelREeU5VZ2huVUZad1FTZFpWWXlhU0RNbllxTTQyOGtNdmJCbUJFT3ZrbHF1cjIzNC1hb3J0MUNITjdQLUxFeGwxTFlQUG1HZklqMHhB0gGTAUFVX3lxTFBoQ3AzNThGMUxZNVBia21XOVRaMks0MXdtMzBjT21rb0FNc2w0a0hEZHhLZGNmRXBOZEx5SmtBbVotWkprVW5vMkNIbHBpUXdmdVZxcG5LVjBrd29qYWpJRjB5dWZUX0c5Y3Y0TXlZcF85eVczeTRMaWktTXhtNDhmRHRoZWl2ZlZVTlpEWS11ZGdPQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

This network, responsible for regulating attention and switching between mental states, was found to be consistently larger in people with depression, regardless of symptom severity or treatment history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the expansion appears to predate the onset of symptoms, offering hope for early identification and intervention. Researchers propose that genetic predisposition, compensatory activity, or relative regional atrophy may underlie this expansion, with wide-reaching implications for future treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Neural Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Enlarged salience network appears before depressive symptoms and persists regardless of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Could allow pre-symptomatic identification of individuals at risk for depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Lens:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports rethinking depression as a disorder of network connectivity, not just neurotransmitter imbalance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Commentary published today, researchers have identified what could be the first reliable biomarker for depression risk, potentially transforming how this devastating condition is identified and treated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary examines recent findings demonstrating that individuals with depression consistently exhibit a functionally enlarged salience network compared to non-depressed controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="An Enlarged Brain Network May Predict Depression" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWtrYWVsc5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinctive Brain Connectivity Pattern Identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The salience network, a neural system responsible for attention allocation and switching between different brain networks, appears to be functionally twice as large in people with depression as in those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, highlighted in the commentary by researchers at the University of Ottawa and the University of California San Francisco, builds upon groundbreaking research published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by Lynch et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery so significant is that the expanded salience network predates the onset of depressive symptoms and remains stable regardless of symptom severity or treatment interventions,” explained Dr. Nicholas Fabiano, co-author of the commentary from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re potentially looking at a distinctive neural signature that could identify individuals at risk for depression before they experience symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This characteristic brain connectivity pattern was observed consistently across individuals with depression, suggesting its potential as a depression biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The salience network, comprising the fronto-insular cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and temporal poles, plays a crucial role in reward processing and regulating the switch between the default mode network and frontoparietal network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Early Identification and Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression affects millions worldwide, yet remains poorly diagnosed and predicted despite significant advances in mental health awareness. The World Health Organization identifies depression as a leading cause of disability globally, with many cases going undiagnosed until symptoms become severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary authors highlight how this biomarker could transform depression management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying those at risk before they experience the full impact of depression, we can intervene earlier, leading to lasting improvements in their quality of life,” noted Katerina Palacek from the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection has been proven to support remission in those with depressive symptoms and decrease the likelihood of progression to treatment resistance. This could ultimately lessen the chances of relapse, shorter periods of remission, and longer depressive episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What factors might trigger an expanded salience network in those predisposed to depression? Does this pattern appear in other mental health conditions with overlapping symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions represent important next steps for researchers in understanding the implications of this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Mechanisms Behind Network Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose three potential mechanisms underlying this salience network expansion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensatory neural changes&lt;/strong&gt;: The enlarged network could represent a compensatory response based on increased usage of this network in individuals predisposed to depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic predisposition&lt;/strong&gt;: There may be genetic factors contributing to the development of an enlarged salience network in those who later develop depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative expansion due to atrophy&lt;/strong&gt;: The salience network might appear relatively enlarged as a consequence of atrophy in other brain regions that could predate depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we observe similarities between regions implicated in depression-related brain atrophy and the salience network, including the insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, there are also notable differences,” explained Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, co-author from the University of California San Francisco’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests complex interactions between various brain networks in depression that we’re just beginning to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing Depression Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings underscore the need to reconceptualize depression as a disorder of neural connectivity rather than isolated neurotransmitter imbalances, with potential implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is not a simple disease characterized by independently functioning brain areas or isolated neurotransmitter imbalances,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109877"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This characteristic brain connectivity pattern was observed consistently across individuals with depression, suggesting its potential as a depression biomarker.

man was left excessively bleeding due to a rare side effect linked to his Covid vaccine booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unidentified man who is in his 70s went to the hospital after he saw blood in his stool - believing it was due to the colonoscopy he had the day before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while examining him, doctors also noticed large, dark bruises on both of his arms that had developed within the span of a few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed he was suffering from hemophilia A, where the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11919195/Hope-thousands-haemophilia-form-new-injection.html"&gt; body prevents blood from clotting&lt;/a&gt;, causing excessive bleeding from wounds for days at end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This prolonged bleeding can cause blood to accumulate beneath the skin, forming a bruise and make the body more susceptible to injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this particular case, since the patient had sustained wounds from a colorectal procedure, they were mostly bleeding internally and the blood was only visible in their stool.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient had no family history of the condition and was not actively bleeding, according to a medical report about his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-d04903c0-3023-11f0-99e2-b1586d34f4a4" class=""&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts theorized that it was possible the shot triggered his immune system to produce antibodies against his body's clotting process and caused the disorder.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, mRNA vaccines work by prompting the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to attack &lt;span&gt;the Covid virus in the body through a piece of genetic code. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in this case doctors believe that it may be possible that the vaccine also made the body stop recognizing its own cells as safe and began developing antibodies against the clotting process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have noted that adverse reactions to Covid vaccines are extremely rare and that the benefits of getting the shot &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;outweigh potential complications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis, the experts reviewed 21 cases of AHA developing in patients after receiving Covid vaccines between 2020 to 2022 and discovered that they usually were in their 70s and symptoms tend to show 14 days after receiving the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that the condition can be fatal in about 10.3 percent of cases which is why early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AHA can cause bleeding in the skin, muscles, and soft tissues but more concerningly, it can also lead to internal bleeding, including in the brain and gastrointestinal tract - which if not controlled, can cause the body to start bleeding out and in certain cases, lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It remains unclear exactly how the vaccine triggered specific clotting antibody production in the patients' bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases OF AHA occurred after people received their first or second dose of the Covid vaccine - when the immune response is highest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this particular man developed the bleeding disorder after his fifth dose - making his case distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the elderly man initially went to the doctors, his white blood cell count, platelets count, liver and kidney function all appeared normal during tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But much to their surprise, the bruising on his arms continued to worsen and he developed large marks on his left knee two weeks later - prompting doctors to order more intensive blood tests which included a plasma test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that while his white cell and platelets counts were normal, they were certain antibodies present in his plasma that were not allowing the body's clotting process to function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed that his body's FVIII, crucial protein involved in forming blood clots to stop bleeding, levels were only at one percent in his body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, he was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A - which is known to primarily target the FVIII protein in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typical symptoms of this condition include nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood, blood in the urine and gastrointestinal bleeding. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consequently, patients also develop also complications associated with abnormal, uncontrolled bleeding into the muscles, skin and soft tissue that can occur spontaneously, during surgery or following trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it is usually treatable, AHA can potentially cause life-threatening bleeding complications in certain cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts estimate that the condition affects about two people per a million in the US - meaning that it is diagnosed in nearly 1,000 people in a population of 340 million people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for treatment, the elderly man was asked to visit a haematology clinic every week and began taking cyclophosphamide (&lt;span&gt;an immunosuppressant medication used to treat autoimmune diseases). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doctors progressively decreased his cyclophosphamide dosage as his FVIII levels improved and he showed signs of recovery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, he was also given medications to prevent fungal infections and protect the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 19:12:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORWFMUllJb3A3alhUR0I4ZzEtY3ctYmRral9yWTN2TzJBVEhqY0x2bjdIQUx1M0N2djNZOXNuQXUwLXBJMXR6eEJLOUx4bFpLX2pDSk5sVUtaNjMyamFyRkR4NHRJTWNYLWM2ZE1oZndCMC02R0pKLWUwM3ZhRTg2UVRzdW5tZEs0eERDUFUta3BuWnJOX2k4UW1KOGhuSE1rdTNzYnBkQmvSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUJTTm1RZWJUN21PY3RjSW5CVmRtZmkyMEZNeW81NDJkdnBGS2FjOWk2bS1CNnZ2RFh1Q2tDSW51WDItb3FucGxTV3poVW1zVzU2d0hGVXFxdkQtYlkzODV1RnZPVHBCVEJOaUxVU2hvdC02SWthN2xpaEdyZTZHRUJ5b19BbmZlTDVqaklSVmJIcEhtYUN2Nk1fQ0I2RWFvZVJKWVRSTk01eU82N0hn</guid></item><item><title>坐得太多？即使你经常锻炼，你的大脑也可能会萎缩-研究发现 | Sitting Too Much?

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older adults who sat longer each day showed faster brain shrinkage, even if they exercised regularly.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sitting time was linked to worse memory and cognitive performance, especially in people with the APOE-ε4 gene.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spending less time sitting may protect your brain as much as adding more exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASHVILLE —&lt;/strong&gt; Are you reading this while lounging on your couch? You might want to stand up. New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study spanning seven years found that older adults who spent more hours sitting experienced faster brain shrinkage and mental decline – even among those who regularly worked out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding challenges what many people believe: that regular exercise makes up for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hours of sitting&lt;/a&gt;. According to the research, most participants were active enough to meet CDC guidelines for weekly physical activity. Yet their sedentary behavior still harmed their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-cost-of-being-sedentary"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Being Sedentary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Vanderbilt University’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center followed 404 older adults (average age 71) for seven years, using wrist-worn activity monitors to accurately track movement patterns. On average, participants sat for about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/millennials-sitting-biological-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;13 hours daily&lt;/a&gt; – a number that might seem high until you add up your own sitting time from commuting, desk work, meals, and evening relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain changes linked to more sitting occurred in regions that are typically vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. People who sat more showed thinning in these areas and performed worse on memory tests that asked them to recall past experiences and events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, those who sat more lost hippocampal volume faster and showed greater declines in their ability to name objects and process information quickly. The hippocampus, which helps form memories, is among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-risk-factors-amplify-the-problem"&gt;Genetic Risk Factors Amplify the Problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most concerning was that sitting had worse effects on carriers of the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/alzheimers-shaping-brain-20s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APOE-ε4 gene variant&lt;/a&gt;, which increases Alzheimer’s risk. When researchers separated participants by genetic status, they discovered that APOE-ε4 carriers who sat more showed significantly greater reductions in total brain matter, frontal lobe volume, and parietal lobe volume compared to non-carriers with similar sitting habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that “APOE-ε4 carriers appear to be at increased risk for neurodegeneration associated with greater &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sedentary-study-obesity/"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt;, independent of physical activity level.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have connected too much sitting with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, and cancer, this research strengthens the evidence that brain health belongs on that list. Researchers believe that prolonged sitting may harm blood vessels in the brain, increase &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-worked"&gt;How the Study Worked&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team used advanced equipment that measured movement 30 times per second. This allowed them to distinguish between sitting still, light activity like casual walking, and more vigorous movement far more accurately than asking people to recall their activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed extensive cognitive testing and underwent detailed brain scans at the beginning of the study and during follow-up visits. Researchers analyzed various brain regions and something they called an “AD-neuroimaging signature” – a measurement of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brain-thinning-dementia-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain thickness&lt;/a&gt; in areas typically affected by Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this study particularly valuable is that it controlled for physical activity, allowing researchers to isolate the specific effects of sitting. This reveals that even if you follow exercise guidelines religiously, spending most of your remaining hours sitting could still &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/doing-chores-bigger-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;harm your brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-your-brain-health"&gt;Protecting Your Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With smartphones and artificial intelligence making it easier and easier for people to do countless tasks without getting up, it’s no surprise Americans are becoming increasingly sedentary. The average &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;older adult&lt;/a&gt; spends over 9 hours sitting daily, according to previous research mentioned in the study. And that was before the pandemic pushed many people toward even less active lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For anyone worried about brain health, the message is clear: cutting sitting time matters just as much as increasing exercise. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/standing-desks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Standing desks&lt;/a&gt;, movement breaks throughout the day, and finding ways to add more motion to daily routines could help protect against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to an important conclusion: what you do between workouts matters just as much as the workouts themselves. Your &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; depends not just on making time for exercise, but on minimizing time spent sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project studied 404 older adults (71 ± 9 years old) without dementia at baseline. Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT9X Link) on their non-dominant wrist continuously for 7 days to measure sedentary behavior and physical activity levels. They also underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and 3T brain MRI scans at baseline and follow-up visits over a 7-year period (average follow-up time was 4.7 years). The researchers used linear regressions for cross-sectional analyses and linear mixed-effects regression models for longitudinal analyses, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, APOE-ε4 status, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, cognitive status, and intracranial volume (for MRI outcomes). Models were repeated with adjustment for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to assess the independent contribution of sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greater sedentary time was cross-sectionally associated with a smaller Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging signature (a composite measure of cortical thickness in regions affected by AD) and worse episodic memory performance. Longitudinally, greater sedentary time was associated with faster hippocampal volume reductions and faster declines in naming and processing speed. Many of the observed associations (particularly cross-sectional ones) were stronger in APOE-ε4 carriers, suggesting that genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease may amplify the negative effects of sedentary behavior. Importantly, most participants (87%) met CDC physical activity guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity weekly, suggesting that high physical activity levels do not completely counteract the negative effects of sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sample lacked racial and ethnic diversity (85% non-Hispanic White) and was highly educated (average 16 years of education), limiting generalizability. The sample was also quite physically active, with 87% meeting CDC physical activity recommendations, which may limit generalizability to less active populations. The researchers used cross-sectional MRI registration at each time point versus longitudinal registration. The study did not examine the pattern of sedentary behavior (e.g., prolonged sitting versus frequent breaks) or consider a compositional analysis of the 24-hour activity period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by multiple grants, including T32-AG058524, Alzheimer’s Association IIRG-08-88733, R01-AG034962, K24-AG046373, K01-AG083223, Vanderbilt Clinical Translational Science Awards, Vanderbilt’s High-Performance Computer Cluster for Biomedical Research, and the Richard Eugene Hickman Alzheimer’s Disease Research Endowment.

New form of disease recognised after decades of debate"&gt;recognised as a distinct form of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by the International Diabetes Federation. Despite the name, there are more than a dozen different types of diabetes. The classification isn’t quite as tidy as the numbering suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a clear guide to the different types, including some that you may not have heard of, along with information about what causes them and how they are treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/type-1-diabetes"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the body’s immune system mistakenly attacking the &lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;-producing cells in the pancreas. This autoimmune reaction can occur at any age, from infancy through to old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not linked to diet or lifestyle. Instead, it probably results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, such as viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment involves lifelong insulin therapy, delivered through injections or pumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 loWMeq"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves lifelong insulin therapy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66263"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves lifelong insulin therapy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of people who struggle with low blood sugars, called hypoglycaemia, can receive new cells in the pancreas that produce insulin from deceased donors. For many, this reduces the number of insulin injections needed. Some can stop taking their insulin altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, dozens of people have now received stem-cell-derived transplants to effectively “cure” their diabetes, although people still need to take strong immune-suppressing drugs. This treatment is not yet widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/type-2-diabetes"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is the most common form of the condition and is often linked to having a high BMI (body mass index). However, it can also affect people of normal weight, particularly those with a strong genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain ethnic groups, including South Asians and people of African and Caribbean descent, are at higher risk, even at lower body weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the body’s production of insulin can help to control &lt;a href="/topic/blood-sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels. Some drugs boost insulin production from the pancreas, while others improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin, for example, is taken by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This drug improves insulin sensitivity and switches off sugar production by the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of different drugs to help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. Tailoring treatment to the individual has been shown to improve health outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes can also reverse diabetes. This can be done by keeping a low-calorie diet of 800 calories a day. In a research trial, maintaining this diet for 12 months reversed diabetes in 46 per cent of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gestational diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy, typically between weeks 24 and 28. It is triggered by hormonal changes that reduce the body’s sensitivity to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include being overweight or obese, having a family history of diabetes, and giving birth to a large baby in a previous pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those from Middle Eastern, south Asian, black and African Caribbean backgrounds are also at higher risk of gestational diabetes. Age is also a factor, as insulin sensitivity declines with age. This can be treated with diet and exercise, tablets or insulin injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rarer forms of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least nine subtypes of diabetes that include rare genetic forms, sometimes caused by a single genetic change. Others can be caused by treatment, such as surgery or drugs, such as steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neonatal &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; appears early in life. Some of the genetic changes affect how &lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; is released from the pancreas. Some people still make their own &lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, so can be treated with tablets that help pancreas cells to push out &lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maturity-onset &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; of the young, or Mody, occurs later in life and is linked to genetic changes. There are several gene changes, with some affecting how pancreas cells sense sugar and others affecting how the pancreas develops. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 3c &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is different. It is caused by damage to the pancreas. People with pancreatic cancer, for example, can develop &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; after parts of the pancreas are removed. It can also develop after pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with cystic fibrosis are also at a higher risk of developing &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. This is called cystic fibrosis-related &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The risk increases with age and is very common, with around a third of people with cystic fibrosis developing &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by the age of 40. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newly designated form is linked to malnutrition during early life. Type 5 diabetes is more common in poorer countries. It affects around 20-25 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have low body weight and lack insulin. But the lack of insulin is not caused by the immune system. Instead, the body may not have received the correct nutrition during childhood to help the pancreas develop normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies with rodents have shown that a low-protein diet during pregnancy or adolescence leads to poor pancreas development. This has been known for many years. Having a smaller pancreas is a risk factor for different forms of diabetes. Essentially, having fewer reserves of insulin-producing cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1kgrxrh-0 IuFeK"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-1kgrxrh-3 bCcmfs"&gt;Main symptoms of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-1kgrxrh-4 gFApdk"&gt;NHS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1kgrxrh-5 iJEtqr"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;feeling very thirsty &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;peeing more frequently than usual, particularly at night &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;feeling very tired &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weight loss and loss of muscle bulk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blurred vision &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that result in raised blood sugar levels, but the underlying causes vary widely. Understanding the specific types of diabetes someone has is crucial to providing the right treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical science evolves, so does the classification of diabetes. Recognising malnutrition-related diabetes as type 5 will stimulate discussion. This is a step towards better global understanding and care – especially in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig Beall is a Senior Lecturer in the Neuroscience of Energy Homeostasis at the University of Exeter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p&gt;In a world-first clinical trial, Japanese scientists have successfully implanted lab-grown brain cells into Parkinson’s disease patients — and early results suggest the treatment may actually work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the results hold, the implications could be enormous — not just for Parkinson’s, but for other neurodegenerative diseases too. Huntington’s, ALS, even Alzheimer’s could be future targets for similar cell-replacement strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It begins subtly, often with tremors in one hand or a slight stiffness in the limbs. But over time, it chips away at a person’s ability to walk, speak, and live independently. It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://parkinsonseurope.org/facts-and-figures/statistics/"&gt;10 million people&lt;/a&gt; live with Parkinson’s, and is prevalence is rising fast as populations age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit is the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/parkinsons-disease/causes/"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Without enough &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/dopamine-movement-neurons/"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, the brain’s signals to the muscles falter. There’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, just treatments to slow down progression and deal with some of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had the idea to replace dead cells directly in the brain for decades. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536728/"&gt;In the 1980s&lt;/a&gt; and ’90s, some researchers tried &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3250289/"&gt;transplanting fetal brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; into patients, but the results were inconsistent. Some patients improved, others didn’t. Tumors and uncontrolled movements were common side effects. And the ethical concerns surrounding fetal tissue never went away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study from Japan takes a new approach to this idea. Instead of fetal tissue, researchers used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) — adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells. These versatile cells can be turned into nearly any cell type in the body. And that includes the dopamine-producing neurons that Parkinson’s destroys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-promising-though-not-perfect"&gt;Promising, though not perfect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were enrolled in the study. One dropped out before surgery due to a COVID-19 infection, and another received the transplant in two stages and was evaluated only for safety (not for drug efficacy). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of the patients had any major side effects and four showed improvements in movement when off their usual medications. Their average motor scores improved by 20%, and brain scans confirmed that the implanted cells were producing dopamine. A fifth patient improved while on medication. One patient didn’t improve, but their symptoms didn’t worsen either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gains were modest but meaningful. One patient improved by two stages on &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379751/"&gt;the Hoehn–Yahr scale&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used measure of Parkinson’s severity. Another saw a 50% improvement in motor function during off-medication testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a significant achievement that we have been able to confirm improvement in patients’ symptoms,” &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08700-0"&gt;said Jun Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;, director of Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, who is leading the research. “We hope to deliver this treatment to patients as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dopamine-is-back-to-an-extent"&gt;Dopamine is back, to an extent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers carried out brain scans to see how much dopamine production increased. They used a specialized tracer and found that in the patients that received the highest dose, dopamine increased by an average of 63.5%; in the low-dose group, it rose by just 7%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, in three patients, dopamine activity increased only in specific parts of the brain — right where the cells were injected. That local boost was still enough to improve symptoms in some cases, but there was no generalized return of dopamine production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study authors are confident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This trial is the most advanced test yet of iPS-cell-derived neurons in human patients — and the results may open the door to regulatory approval. Sumitomo Pharma, the company which helped manufacture the cells, plans to seek approval to manufacture and sell the treatment in Japan by the end of fiscal 2025. If successful, it would become only the second approved iPS-cell-based regenerative medicine product in the country, after a treatment for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s goal is to develop a standardized, off-the-shelf cell therapy that can be administered to a wide population. The cells used in this study were derived from a donor whose genetic immune profile matches about 17% of the Japanese population, reducing the risk of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japan has made regenerative medicine &lt;a href="https://www.jetro.go.jp/usa/topics/japan-laws-regenerative-medicine-market.html"&gt;a priority&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first country to approve clinical use of iPS cells, and it continues to lead in funding and infrastructure for stem cell-based treatments. This trial may put Japan at the forefront of a new era in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08700-0"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you hit the gym after work, head to the local park to chill with friends, or—if you're like me—unwind with a luxurious bubble bath. For many of us, kicking back often includes a drink or two. After all, consuming alcohol is commonly associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6760384/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress relief;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stress relief&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of something with dinner. But when it comes to whether you grab an &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64431721/is-it-ok-to-drink-beer-every-day-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ice-cold beer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ice-cold beer&lt;/a&gt; from the fridge or opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glass of wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;glass of wine&lt;/a&gt; to cap off your week, there are a few things worth considering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both beer and wine have their own benefits and downfalls. "Neither is inherently better, but the context of consumption matters greatly," says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits Of Wine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two beverages, experts often highlight red wine for its health benefits. Registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-abrownstein.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Brownstein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, notes that red wine in particular is loaded with polyphenols—antioxidants that may help protect the heart, lower &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"bad" LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"bad" LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce inflammation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770725000636" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that moderate red wine consumption can decrease LDL cholesterol, which is linked to a lower risk of artery-clogging and heart disease. "Polyphenols in red wine help lower cholesterol by limiting how much the liver absorbs and preventing the breakdown of LDL cholesterol," Brownstein explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/entertaining/wine/g29023291/red-wine-types/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:red wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;red wine&lt;/a&gt; "has been lauded for its antioxidants like resveratrol, which may support heart health," says Manaker. Resveratrol has been known to prevent plaque buildup on artery walls and has both anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63015074/walnuts-anti-aging-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However," cautions Brownstein, "despite promising research on resveratrol's health benefits, additional studies are needed to shape clinical guidance and recommendations. Moreover, it remains unclear if the resveratrol's benefits outweigh alcohol's negative health effects." In fact, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4942868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even concluded that it's not actually possible to absorb the recommended therapeutic dose of resveratrol solely by drinking wine, anyway. What a buzz kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, Manaker tells us that some of the health benefits associated with red wine can also be found in grape juice, particularly when it comes to heart health. Shucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some experts claim that red wine has a slight edge in health benefits when compared to white varietals, the differences are pretty negligible. White wine has fewer &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64210343/superfoods-to-help-you-live-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and polyphenols, but still enough that it can help aid in digestion and support the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits Of Beer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For beer drinkers, you'll be happy to discover that a number of brews contain certain B vitamins. "Some types of beer," explains Manaker, "especially craft and darker varieties, also contain antioxidants, though typically in smaller amounts than red wine." Add to that recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001413/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown moderate beer consumption is linked to a decrease in cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, not to mention its link to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/sns-dailymeal-1870435-healthy-eating-beer-unexpected-health-benefits-study-020818-20180208-story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other metabolic health benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other metabolic health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and that beer after work suddenly isn't looking too bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Downfalls Of Beer &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both beer and wine have their own purported health benefits, like anything, they should only be consumed in moderation. "Alcohol of any kind can negatively impact liver health, disrupt sleep, and increase your risk of chronic conditions and addiction when consumed in excess," says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also points out another health consideration: "These beverages come with calories, which can add up quickly, especially with beer, which is often consumed in larger quantities." Generally, beer contains more calories &lt;em&gt;per s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;erving&lt;/em&gt; than wine, mainly due to its larger serving size and higher carbohydrate content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a standard 175 ml (about 6 oz) glass of 12% ABV wine has around 133 calories, while a pint (16 oz) of 5% ABV beer contains about 239 calories—making "a beer" roughly 50% higher in calories per typical serving than "a glass" of wine. (A serving of red wine is smaller than a serving of beer because it typically has a higher alcohol content, so it’s important to keep portion sizes in mind.) If you’re watching your calorie intake, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/g36742827/best-light-beer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:light beers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;light beers&lt;/a&gt; are a lower-calorie option, often containing &lt;a href="https://www.cspinet.org/article/which-alcoholic-beverages-have-most-or-least-calories" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fewer calories than both regular beer and wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fewer calories than both regular beer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, both beer and wine are alcohol, which comes with serious health concerns. "While sharing a glass of red wine with friends during a wholesome meal that includes fish, vegetables, and whole grains can absolutely be part of a healthy lifestyle for most, polishing off an entire bottle alone on the couch while binge-watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64717140/love-island-serena-page-unfollowed-costars-suck-it-up/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Love Island;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Love Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reruns is a different story," Manaker colorfully notes. "Ultimately, the healthiest choice is to drink mindfully, within your personal limits, and as part of an overall balanced diet. Moderation and context are the keys!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, "moderate" drinking is considered two drinks or less per day for men and one drink or less per day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when it comes down to it, which drink is actually better for your health? Manaker says it depends not only on your personal preferences, but also on your overall lifestyle. "Both have potential health benefits in moderation, but it’s important first emphasize the key word: moderation," she says. Brownstein has a more definitive answer: "Red wine would be considered healthier than beer due to its polyphenol content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownstein shares that one &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1519" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that those who moderately drink beer reported better self-perceived health, including better mental and physical health and social support, compared to people who did not drink, as well as former drinkers and those who consume high amounts of alcohol. However, she recommends weighing your decision whether or not to drink along with your healthcare provider and lifestyle, medical history, and health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly for those of us who love an end-of-day drink, the health benefits of wine and beer are modest at best, and don't seem to outweigh the cancer risks and other associated negatives of drinking. When it comes to beer vs. wine, there's not a hard and fast "better" option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, enjoying either wine or beer is all about finding what works for you and pairing it with a healthy lifestyle," states Manaker. "Both can bring enjoyment, whether during a meal or a social gathering, as long as they’re consumed thoughtfully."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 18:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBzeE0zYnVsR2xzNVRjcjRsbndJWFZJQlRfMXM3ZU1iaVdER0RFNUJ1S183Tk9jZmc2RGdfMnRjdnM0V1hZTHhDSERicExOei1YeEgyN3VhczlTVGxpaVg2bkZtcmNjOHR6T05nRDExTmRkSWZa</guid></item><item><title>沙特阿拉伯确认9例MERS病例，包括医院集群- CIDRAP | Saudi Arabia confirms 9 MERS cases, including hospital cluster - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQN1B4ck5HQ3k5UVBnTmlVMnlnLTh0Q0hrZml1bjZValhUTGVUQU44bDkwUUsybnJiVTZkdFRKY2l4RnBqcG1KOWtNQkQxWjFac2xBVlcwdlNYQ00tU1lncXhma1BHa1pGMFA5WUJfX1YydGppcHQzOF9jM3FvTFhxcHc1dzRyZHFBMS1KU3JicXNxZDRUVmQwUFp1cW8xUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON569"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; nine new MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) cases from Saudi Arabia, two of them fatal, which include a hospital cluster of seven cases in Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Saudi Arabia's first since March, when the WHO reported four cases, which occurred between September 2024 and February 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the patients is an adult from Hail in the west central part of the country who is older than 65 years and whose symptoms began on February 20. The patient was hospitalized and died 3 days later from his or her illness. Investigators found that the patient had indirect contact with camels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient is an adult from Riyadh who is younger than 65 and whose symptoms began on March 31. The patient was hospitalized on April 6 and died from his or her illness. Health officials found that the patient, who is not a healthcare worker, had no known contact with camels or camel products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Four of six health workers had no symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index patient in the Riyadh hospital cluster is an older adult whose symptoms began on April 3 and was hospitalized on April 6. He or she has since recovered, and follow-up found no known exposure to camels or camel products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing and testing found infections in six of the hospital's healthcare workers, but only two had mild, nonspecific symptoms, with illness onsets on April 11 and April 16. All were adults younger than age 65, and all recovered from their infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the nine patients, five were men and four were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its statement, the WHO said the new cases don't change its overall risk assessment for MERS-CoV, which remains moderate for both the regional and global levels.&lt;span&gt; "&lt;/span&gt;These cases show that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels and spilling over into the human population," the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;COVID-related factors may be driving MERS declines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of MERS-CoV cases to the WHO declined substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the WHO said was initially likely due to the prioritization of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. It added, however, that since the main COVID threat has eased, Saudi Arabia has ramped up testing for MERS-CoV. And since 2023, sentinel surveillance has included testing samples that are negative for flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO also noted that infection protection and control measures implemented during COVID-19 circulation may have reduced onward spread of MERS-CoV. Cross-protection from COVID infection or vaccination has been theorized, but requires further investigation, the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the virus was first detected in humans in 2012, Saudi Arabia has now reported 2,627 lab-confirmed cases, and 946 patients (36%) died from their infections. During the height of Saudi Arabia's MERS outbreaks in 2014 and the years that followed, hospital-related clusters were a notable feature of virus spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Two children in Texas have died. Both children were unvaccinated and did not have underlying health conditions, according to Texas officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people. The two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Due to widespread vaccine uptake, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Since then, there have still been outbreaks in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone, beginning at about 12 months of age. People who are pregnant or immunocompromised are not recommended to take the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:47:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNYUtnMk9aQ3hhNDQxUGluVXNhbXBKbTVhc2psNzlGSUdqbzU2YXh1Vm9ZUnRYci1nS1RFd1AyWV9MeFlVVm1OVlNuZFA1R2FiT0Z1UE90QkJ4dkFSYXA2NGF2YjB3T1dtcGxVR2tyb0VuXzdlUEFVbnRxbG40ZTVkandvcVBQVzFvaWVjbWRTUktuQTRZZWZfUTZjOUpBSUFVQ05sQ2tGalJNR2YtY3c5MTZLSHU1eTV0WHpwQ0lQN2tmSGREWlZ4V0piZElxTlpGXzU5aGtYWWtEb2s</guid></item><item><title>我们分析了几十个冷冻披萨。以下是最健康的选择。-《华盛顿邮报》 | We analyzed dozens of frozen pizzas.

But many of them have a major downside: They’re ultra-processed. They’re frequently laden with salt, saturated fat, added sugars and industrial additives like artificial flavors, synthetic preservatives and emulsifiers. &lt;a href="https://cappellos.com/collections/pizza/products/uncured-pepperoni-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;Some popular frozen cheese pizza brands&lt;/a&gt; have nearly an entire day’s worth of saturated fat and 60 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SIFR3SHRNAF7O3SVP4ZSEFVPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/27/ultra-processed-foods-predigested-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that eating a lot of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic diseases. Health experts say it’s a good idea to limit your intake — but that you don’t have to avoid them at all costs. For one, it’s impractical: Ultra-processed foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01095-7" target="_blank"&gt;about 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all food items sold in grocery stores. And second, you can include some processed foods in your diet and still be healthy. That’s because they’re not all created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEVDYPIPVBGCJKK7QKBQL5VYTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We analyzed dozens of frozen pizza brands and discovered that some use mostly simple ingredients like wheat flour, tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic powder and mozzarella cheese, while others contain so many preservatives, flavor enhancers, emulsifiers and artificial ingredients that their ingredients lists can sound like a high school chemistry experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTXWDGJX5FHBTCQUH4P2ODSU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how to make frozen pizza a more nutritious meal, red flags to watch out for — and six of the healthiest pizzas we found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to make frozen pizzas healthier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUNGQPEBSNH3NP6A6EAZ2SWG44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You probably&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;shouldn’t eat frozen pizza every day, nutrition experts say, but it can still be part of a healthy, occasional lunch or dinner. The key is to purchase a quality brand and to make it part of a balanced meal, said Federica Amati, a medical scientist at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at Zoe, a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;personalized nutrition company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FKI4MZ37RJEV7NVDWJ3R7PKEYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could steam some broccoli or chop up carrots and cucumbers to eat with your pizza. Maybe make a hard-boiled egg to go along with it. And have some fresh fruit, walnuts or mixed nuts at the end of your meal, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24C5RPM4D5C73EF3KJSRJYG7PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want pizza with toppings, choose ones that have veggies such as onion, peppers, mushrooms and spinach. Or better yet, buy a Margherita pizza and add your own veggies at home. If you have kids, put some sliced veggies, corn and olives on the counter and let them choose their own toppings. Kids are more likely to eat veggies if you give them choices and involve them in the cooking process, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WLUI54CWI5A4VPGUUNEOB7GAVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want meat toppings, you should add your own — ideally things like grilled chicken or tuna. If you want sausage or pepperoni, buy them separately and look for the “uncured” versions that advertise low sodium and no added nitrates or nitrites. These two preservatives have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303088/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Look for these red flags on the label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="P3EZN46IYFG5FH7C2OUMB37ERE" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High sodium:&lt;/b&gt; Many brands of frozen cheese pizza contain high levels of sodium. It’s not uncommon to see brands that add salt to the crust, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings. We found that sodium levels in most brands of frozen pizza ranged from about 20 to 60 percent of the recommended daily limit for sodium intake per serving. Consuming a lot of sodium can increase your &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;risk of developing hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. It’s best to look for brands that are relatively low in sodium — the less sodium the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added sugars: &lt;/b&gt;Some brands add sugar into their pizza sauces and crusts. We found brands that had nearly a teaspoon of added sugar per serving or more. While it’s normal for pizza to contain some sugar — tomatoes naturally contain some sugar — you don’t need a lot of extra&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sugar in your pizza. Look for brands that contain no more than one or two grams of added sugar per serving — or, ideally, no added sugar at all. Added sugars may be listed on food labels under names like dextrose, corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup, malt barley extract, sucrose and cane sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processed meats:&lt;/b&gt; Processed meats like pepperoni, sausage and bacon contain a lot of sodium, saturated fat and preservatives. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that they increase your risk of developing multiple cancers, colorectal cancer in particular. For that reason, you should avoid buying frozen pizzas that have processed meats on them, Amati said. Processed meats are generally considered those that are smoked, cured, salted or that have had preservatives added to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrial additives:&lt;/b&gt; Many frozen pizza brands use additives that have been linked to health problems. These include things like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) — two synthetic preservatives that have been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590883/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer in animal studies&lt;/a&gt;. Other additives to look out for are emulsifiers like &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank"&gt;polysorbate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8539934/" target="_blank"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004338" target="_blank"&gt;mono- and diglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as industrial preservatives such as propylparaben and sodium nitrite. Pick frozen pizzas that contain mostly simple ingredients that you recognize and would use at home in your own kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Try these healthier frozen pizza brands&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="5KBIKC4WG5BMBGHIOWUEUFY2XQ" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/cheese-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s Cheese Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This frozen pizza has one of the simplest ingredients lists we could find. The primary ingredients are organic wheat flour, mozzarella cheese, organic tomato puree, organic extra virgin olive oil, and a variety of everyday spices and seasonings. The pizza is also relatively low in sodium, sugar and saturated fat compared to other brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://newmansown.com/product/harvest-vegetable-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newman’s Own Thin &amp;amp; Crispy Crust Harvest Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This is a good example of a frozen pizza that has recognizable ingredients that you’d expect to find in a home-cooked pizza, Amati said. It is relatively low in salt, sugar and saturated fat compared to other pizzas, and its ingredients list has no surprises. It contains simple things like wheat flour, whole oat flour, vegetable oil, olive oil, tomato puree, mozzarella cheese, red wine vinegar, garlic and other spices. Even better, it has a variety of nutritious toppings, including several vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatbanza.com/products/roasted-veggie" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Banza Roasted Veggie Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This frozen pizza stands out because its crust is made from chickpeas. That means this pizza is gluten-free, and it also has significantly more fiber and protein than most other brands. One serving contains 10 grams of fiber. It also has 16 grams of protein — nearly equivalent to the amount of protein in three eggs. This pizza does have some additives, like tapioca starch and sunflower lecithin, but they are not considered harmful, Amati said. “Overall, this pizza has a nice combination of ingredients,” she added. “It’s a little more processed than the others, but it doesn’t have any ingredients that are high risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodnes.com/cpk-frozen/products/crispy-thin-crust-margherita-frozen-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;California Pizza Kitchen Margherita Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; One serving of this frozen pizza has 20 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving, which is lower than most other brands we analyzed. It also has fairly high-quality ingredients, Amati said. It’s made from things like enriched wheat flour (flour that’s been fortified with iron and B vitamins), tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, extra virgin olive oil, herbs, spices and baking powder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/whole-foods-market-mushroom-with-truffle-sauce-pizza-134-oz-b0cns3v1cm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole Foods Market Mushroom with Truffle Sauce Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The ingredients list for this white pizza is notably free of many of the synthetic or potentially problematic additives commonly found in frozen pizzas. The crust contains just five ingredients: wheat flour, water, extra virgin olive oil, salt and yeast. The toppings include recognizable ingredients like lemon juice, sunflower oil, portobello and cremini mushrooms, and mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. It has no added sugar, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it’s relatively low in sodium and saturated fat compared to most other frozen cheese pizzas we looked at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/roasted-vegetable-pizza-vegan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s No Cheese Roasted Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Finding a good-quality vegan or dairy-free frozen pizza is no easy task. That’s because many of them contain ultra-processed cheese alternatives that are made from coconut oil, xanthan gum and various emulsifiers and thickening agents. It’s better to buy a plain wheat crust and add your own tomato or pesto sauce and veggie toppings, Amati said. “As an Italian, I can tell you that pizza does not have to have cheese on it,” she added. Another option is to buy a “no cheese” frozen pizza like this one from Amy’s and add your own vegan cheese, preferably one that’s made from nuts instead of coconut oil and that doesn’t have a lot of additives, Amati said. One example of a vegan cheese with relatively good ingredients is Kite Hill’s dairy-free “&lt;a href="https://kite-hill.com/collections/ricotta-alternative/products/almond-milk-ricotta-alternative" target="_blank"&gt;Almond Milk Ricotta Alternative&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s made from just a handful of ingredients: almond milk (water, almonds) salt, enzymes cultures, and tartaric acid, a preservative that occurs naturally in grapes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

He describes his weight loss and analyzes the drugs and their potential societal impact in his new book, “Diet, Drugs and Dopamine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CI2W7WNYQJEH3JQNYFKIMYCL5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kessler, who is 5 feet 10 inches tall, dropped more than 60 pounds, going from a little over 200 pounds to 137 pounds, and he cut his body fat percentage in half, from 30 percent to 15 percent. But, he said, the drugs’ side effects were not pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HDXMKZCQ3ZGCVE5Z3EX4FS62WM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I lost my appetite. I felt bloated,” he said. “I had intense chills and had to wrap myself in an electric blanket. I felt sick. There was malaise and occasional sharp abdominal pains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3KWSYOAAJCFJDCUIREIXA7X6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nevertheless, he stuck with it and saw his relationship with food and eating begin to change in dramatic ways along with his weight. His cravings for fat, salt and sugar mostly disappeared. He began regularly eating vegetables for the first time. He ate smaller portions but felt full. And his weight plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HSY4QMXSTBHRJKGFFBRC763XPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He thinks these medications, which are taken by self-injection and work by slowing the emptying of the stomach, could halt the trajectory of chronic disease in the United States if used under medical supervision and by the right people. Many insurance plans, including Medicare, won’t cover them for weight loss, and they cost about $1,000 a month, Kessler said. He paid out of pocket for them, he said. And most people who stop them can eventually gain the weight back, so it’s possible many people will need to be on them for the rest of their lives, if they can tolerate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PKEXIX6B6VCBHLQSLX63534PP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Washington Post spoke to Kessler about the promise and perils of these drugs and his own feelings about using them.

It leaks out chemicals — fatty acids — and generates &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/chronic-inflammation-is-long-lasting-insidious-dangerous-and-you-may-not-even-know-you-have-it/2020/01/17/93ab0fa2-316f-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, a major health risk factor. It also promotes elevated levels of insulin, called hyperinsulinemia, because of insulin resistance. When the body’s ability to use insulin is impaired, it can lead to higher blood sugar and a greater risk of Type 2 diabetes. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11601873/#:~:text=The%20age-standardized%20prevalence%20of,38.4%25%20during%20the%20same%20period"&gt;Hyperinsulinemia has increased&lt;/a&gt; among Americans from 28 percent in 1999 to 41.4 percent in 2018.

I was using food to change how I feel. To calm me down. To increase my focus. To keep me going. Food is very powerful, but it has consequences. The mistake I would always make is that I would lose weight and then gain it back. It’s like trying to push a life preserver under water. It keeps coming back up no matter how hard you keep pushing it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZL3FPETKBCU7KBC44NVUTVFU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’ve used the drug in cycles. I was on the drug for about seven months, then off, then back on, then off. I’m off it now, but I have conditioned myself to eat less. When I was on these drugs, ultraformulated foods made me feel ill. These are foods that are formulated to trigger the reward system and are the perfect trifecta of fat, sugar and salt. Also, I no longer want to eat large portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDXIFDRGIVCURFE4I3X3CBMWTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;But how do you maintain weight loss when you are off the drug?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5CYT3ILG3ZG3HBHTZ5S67JIZCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s the key: If food stays in your stomach longer, you can feel sick. People on these medications often eat less to avoid the ill effects of food staying in their stomach longer. You have to relearn how to eat, and that’s what these drugs help you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ2KNI2FCJGZFOLATZ7IAYQ5P4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do these medications make you feel ill?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAXBLTCN55F55GZVCM775E4HJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The drugs work in significant part by triggering gastrointestinal effects, keeping food in the stomach longer and generating feelings that push us to the edge of nausea — and sometimes outright nausea. They counterbalance the rewarding and addictive properties of food and reduce the food “noise,” or incessant wanting, that plays in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6Z5LTX7Z25BMTBLTAXTDUORWHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do people stop using weight-loss drugs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OHZWQSX74ZFKVGXBI3C6R6GIBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are side effects, some of them potentially dangerous. For example, malnutrition or gastroparesis, which occurs in some patients taking the drugs and results from the delayed emptying of the stomach into the small intestine, causing nausea, pain and other digestive issues. Another thing is that people don’t want to be injecting themselves forever. Finally, they are expensive, and insurance doesn’t always cover them or coverage stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIZZ3KCPVBEDHPQWKJFG2SA5TE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the best candidates for these drugs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J2U2RQZCZ5CRPO2JEX352BFQQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have this abdominal visceral fat, and conditions such as hypertension, elevated lipids or glucose,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, talk to your health-care provider about the risks and benefits of taking these drugs. These drugs are potent. Using them, your body fat loss could be double that achieved through diet and exercise. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t exercise, which does a lot of good things for your health, or stop eating healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YE3SKOEURZHZRFS3EGESINNOYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally, do you see another cycle of these drugs in your future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TXEXLEUDCNHLZBXEVMI6LWXKNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We need more data on the safety and efficacy of intermittent use. The FDA should require drug companies to provide it. For me, it’s a journey. If I find myself out of balance, I certainly will consider using the drugs again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxObEl5RjJCbW1oa0RSeTZWVEFzaU1JWjU0a2Q1d05pcXVBZWROX1lKRG5wbTItOTdjQlNHTUpyOEpRY1N1aEhCWjdkWG9VN2ZLX2U4TkhCZnRGUGZkSWhGZEZOWUhxRXhlMGxIN1haQlNWNmQxTTEwbFlzOTZQTGt5Z3l4eGFvSmdQVzRn</guid></item></channel></rss>
