With crops failing and fears of starvation rising, some wealthy Italian city-states like Florence and Venice imported grain from elsewhere in the world. And on those ships most likely came plague-infected fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c11bf5" class="body-graf"&gt;The actions of Florence’s leaders prevented mass starvation —  tens of thousands of famine refugees migrated there, and the city was able to feed them in addition to its own citizens. But the imports unwittingly ushered in a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85646a" class="body-graf"&gt;City leaders were proud of their accomplishment in providing enough food for so many people, said Martin Bauch, an author of the new study and a medieval historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10234" class="body-graf"&gt;“They couldn’t have an idea of what danger was there,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe451a" class="body-graf"&gt;The research offers a historical example of the way that changes in the climate can alter human societies and animal ecosystems in hard-to-predict ways and with incredible downstream consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6d657" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have debated and chased details of the plague’s origin and spread for decades, but this study is the first to outline in detail the potential role of a volcanic eruption. Previous research has suggested climate shifts could be responsible for introductions of the plague at various points in history, but most studies were vague about it, according to Henry Fell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e8470" class="body-graf"&gt;“This paper, I think, is really good for being quite specific on the mechanism that’s driving it,” said Fell, who was not involved in the study but has studied the Black Death and climate change. “We can see grain trade increasing from these ports, and the cause of it is climate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ac69" class="body-graf"&gt;Volcanic eruptions can cool the planet by injecting forms of sulfur into the stratosphere, which reduces the amount of sunshine that can reach Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00d3da" class="body-graf"&gt;“It literally blocks out some of the sun that leads to cooling,” Fell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddba39" class="body-graf"&gt;The effect can last several years after significant eruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5f6c" class="body-graf"&gt;To understand 14th century volcanic activity for the new study, researchers reviewed tree ring records, data from ice cores and written historical observations. All three lines of evidence agreed: A cooling period and a Mediterranean famine from 1345 to 1347 preceded and coincided with the plague’s emergence in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896109" class="body-graf"&gt;The team studied the chemical composition of ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica, since layers of ice in polar regions can trap chemicals from when snow originally fell, offering a kind of timeline. They found that the year 1345 had the 18th-strongest signal for sulfur in the last 2,000 years. The amount of material injected into the stratosphere that year exceeded the best recent example of that dynamic, the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43415342" target="_blank"&gt; Mount Pinatubo injection of 1991&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-238ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Meanwhile, tree rings dating to the same period have biological stains called “blue rings” that indicate stress and a likely cold spell. The blue rings appear consecutively, an extreme rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-815192" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, written accounts from the time in present-day China, Japan, Germany, France and Italy report less sunshine and an increase in cloudiness, the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d44498" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers could not pinpoint which particular volcano or volcanoes erupted in 1345. But they did determine the region of the world: “​This must be a tropical eruption,” Bauch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59c00d" class="body-graf"&gt;The reason: Ice cores from both of Earth’s poles had roughly equal measures of volcanic sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-619d11" class="body-graf"&gt;Historical records show reports of crop failures and high prices for wheat during that cool period, with severe famine in large parts of Spain, southern France, Italy, Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, according to the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-34821e" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, Italian city-states were wealthy, Bauch said, and had developed storage systems for grain and huge trade networks established over centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25c181" class="body-graf"&gt;But as famine deepened, their options dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5f4c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They really start to realize in 1347, ‘We have to import from the Black Sea. That’s the last place where they still have enough grain for our needs,’” Bauch said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0cf7b6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Of course, they’re not aware of how the plague gets to them,” he added. “I have records from Venice in 1349, and they’re really satisfied, and they say, ‘Look, in the last famine, the Black Sea grain really saved us, and that worked very well.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e953d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bauch said he suspects that the plague most likely would have reached Europe eventually but that the events initiated by the volcanic eruptions were likely to have accelerated the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06e312" class="body-graf"&gt;As much as 60% of the population died in parts of Europe from 1347 to 1353, making it one of the deadliest periods in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-83b557" class="body-graf"&gt;Past research on the plague’s origins has relied on written accounts, archaeological evidence and even genetic clues. In 2022, scientists found DNA evidence of the bacterium that causes the plague &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ancient-teeth-offer-new-insight-black-death-emerged-spread-globally-rcna33329" target="_blank"&gt;in bodies buried in modern-day Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; — far east of Europe. Grave markers indicate that many of those killed were buried in 1338 and 1339 (about a decade before the plague hit Europe) and that they died of “pestilence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-7738fa"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg" alt="Yersinia Pestis"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Yersinia pestis bacteria, which cause bubonic plague in animals and humans, are usually transmitted by the bites of infected rat fleas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f783bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The same research group also discovered that marmots living today in the Tian Shan mountain range near the burial site carry a closely related strain of the bacterium, which is a clue that the Black Death could have emerged in that location before it spread elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-673f5e" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study could explain what happened next, Fell said, adding that he thought the authors made a convincing argument that a volcano was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84938c" class="body-graf"&gt;After the plague first exploded in Europe, it re-emerged for centuries, reshaping human history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2131c7" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“In a European context, it’s so important to our history,” Fell said. “Any study where you’re looking at a long time period across Europe, there’ll be a plague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPaFI1c0hLb1FHb3FEVG9tR3RseXlYU2RjNjJvNExQZWMxbFI4dlFNRWpjUGxFLWFTMElCWjNpQlo5b0ZndnQzOVRiV3gxQXR1NmIyc21Td1JvU2VWRDAzVm1SUzlBNG1Ua1VRVWhhZTUyMVpnVjl3WjJNMnh6QzAyQWduYlFNWnduV2NDRllfQzF3aDVFN2xVVNIBVkFVX3lxTE1jLWVENFZQMDdjWk5kcVNrSlltbF9CbV9NMzlfQnVTT01PRXJudjVUbDZweTZHdUZSeDhVZ3lFV2FaTGpxdEM3dXJWNURTQXMtaDVvT0lB</guid></item><item><title>美国癌症协会建议宫颈癌筛查采用自我拭子HPV检测- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/american-cancer-society-recommends-self-swab-hpv-test-cervical-cancer-rcna247244</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8e5fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer screening can now include “self-swab” HPV tests, according to &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70041" target="_blank"&gt;updated guidelines&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday by the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35a923" class="body-graf"&gt;The change, experts hope, will encourage more women to undergo regular screening for the cancer by giving them an alternative to a speculum exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e6521" class="body-graf"&gt;Testing for HPV, or human papillomavirus, has supplanted the Pap test as the preferred method for cervical cancer screening. Pap tests (also called cytology) involve collecting cells from a patient’s cervix during a pelvic exam, a process some women find uncomfortable and even painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85a24a" class="body-graf"&gt; “HPV is such a strong indicator of cervical cancer, we know now that screening for HPV is screening for cervical cancer. This gives more options to women,” said Jane Montealegre, an associate professor of behavioral science at the The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the updated guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf3a0d" class="body-graf"&gt;HPV testing has typically used a similar approach to a Pap test, using cells collected from the cervix. Since 2024, however, the Food and Drug Administration has approved three self-administered HPV tests, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713" target="_blank"&gt;one that can be done at home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c14d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer rates have been steadily falling in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, largely because of improved screening and widespread use of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-safe-cuts-cancer-risk-large-studies-rfk-jr-rcna245437" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; since its approval in 2006. There are 40 different types of HPV that can infect the genitals, 13 of which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic-information.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause nearly all cervical cancers&lt;/a&gt;. HPV testing focuses on the high-risk strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-494030" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite falling rates of cervical cancer, more than 20% of American women aren’t up to date on screening, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; study found. The self-administered tests allow patients to collect their own sample using a vaginal swab in a doctor’s office. One of the FDA-approved tests allows women to use the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713" target="_blank"&gt;swab at home&lt;/a&gt; and mail it to a lab for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ba1dc0" class="body-graf"&gt;The self-administered tests allow patients to collect their own sample using a vaginal swab in a doctor’s office. One of the FDA-approved tests allows women to use the swab at home and mail it to a lab for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-07ca1a" class="body-graf"&gt;“A woman would be given a kit and could go some place, either the exam room or bathroom, and collect her own sample,” said Robert Smith, a cancer epidemiologist and senior vice president of early cancer detection science for the American Cancer Society. Smith was the senior author of the update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbf225" class="body-graf"&gt;Both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — a group of independent doctors, nurses and public health experts who regularly review the latest scientific research and issue recommendations for everything from diabetes to cancer screening — &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommend women screen for cervical cancer using HPV testing every 5 years&lt;/a&gt;. If the test is positive, a doctor will follow up with additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-509d69" class="body-graf"&gt;Both groups also say patients can be screened using a Pap test  and a speculum exam every 3 years, or through using both methods every 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-790be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Where the two groups differ is when screening should begin: The American Cancer Society  recommends women start this screening regimen at age 25, and not screen before that. The task force, whose  recommendations influence what screenings insurance will cover, &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening#fullrecommendationstart" target="_blank"&gt;recommends starting the HPV screening schedule at age 30&lt;/a&gt;, and screening with cytology alone every 3 years between ages 21 and 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0cd9a7" class="body-graf"&gt;Montealegre said she does not expect the task force to change its stance on this, however, it is expected to update its guidelines for HPV screening to include self-administered tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7eb07e" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer screening is covered under the Affordable Care Act, and Montealegre said the self-administered tests, at least those administered at a health clinic, will likely be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae4360" class="body-graf"&gt;“Primary HPV testing is already recommended by the USPSTF, so it is already covered by insurance, and they don’t specify how it has to be collected,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-95f411" class="body-graf"&gt;Both organizations recommending the HPV test as the primary way to screen for cervical cancer “indicates that there is growing agreement that it is the gold standard,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b965d8" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have known for years that primary HPV testing is much more efficient, now we are doing self-sampling to allow for better access,” said Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and family medicine at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-285b21" class="body-graf"&gt;The American Cancer Society update also included clarification on when a woman can stop cervical cancer screening. Previously, both the group and the task force recommended screening up to age 65. The updated guidelines clarify that this should be the case only if a woman has had consistent screening, with negative results, for at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01b19c" class="body-graf"&gt;“Despite clear recommendations on the importance of women being up to date with screening up to 65, very few women are,” Smith said. “It’s important for women to understand that there is a record they will want to have by the time they are 65 that will basically tell them it’s safe to stop screening for cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f33994" class="body-graf"&gt;Harper, who wasn’t involved in drafting the new guidelines, expects that in the coming years, cervical cancer screening will likely be done at even longer intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d93e84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We have data showing now that in a highly vaccinated population, you can screen every 10 years, but we in the U.S. are lagging behind,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQRWdhTlk0LXhLLVZnQV9PbGoyV2VUZm9aam42NDFqRElGam1ndnpDa0I0VFA4X253WHdLNlVkaWRrVy1qckU5cG1XZkdSc1lqN2NYMlJKeEIwdUR1a1AyWUNtZ1FSVE5xdGxhZFlrSF9MZnhQT2NxeTJiRXNxM2puaGNZSHp0amE3eWVXRkp5dUhFN1BLYmRkSlZVOWpTUEg2bEZUSGp4RGVfZ1phejRvSUtqYmotZlNfd3RNSF9Va2ZhTjTSAVZBVV95cUxOa2FFQ1VGcWRZNjRrWm1DeWl0enU2VXlEZHZOUnJsS2VSUm1vOFhQOHZ2NVd1bk1MTDEwUlJoaGxWYmtobVhKYXpoVGkwQmxlUHItVjc0QQ</guid></item><item><title>65岁的祖母在被诊断出致命疾病之前被告知她的头晕是由于抑郁症造成的-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/grandmother-65-told-her-dizziness-130942459.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pamela Cook began feeling unwell in September 2023 and was prescribed antidepressants by her doctor, her daughter told British charity Brain Tumor research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the 65-year-old's symptoms, including feeling dizzy, didn't improve, doctors told her to give the medication more time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shortly after, Cook ended up in the emergency room and was given an MRI scan that revealed a deadly diagnosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A grandmother who died from an aggressive brain tumor in March 2024 was initially told her symptoms were due to depression, her family has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pamela Cook, 65, from Lincoln, England, began feeling unwell in the fall of 2023 when she started experiencing dizziness, headaches and forgetfulness, according to British charity Brain Tumour Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There were no clear signs that anything was wrong at first,” her daughter Clair Bowkett said in a &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/in-our-hearts/pamela-cook?srsltid=AfmBOoqjnfPI-QizjuEh2iXCpjvWmD1bHBKDZjyCTGj-0qKG1eCpwyyq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; on the charity's website. “Mum had always been a bit forgetful. We used to laugh when she called everyone’s names before finally getting to the right one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, it wasn’t until September 2023 when Cook “began to feel dizzy, tired, and low in confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“She went to the doctor, who said it was depression and prescribed antidepressants,” Bowkett recalled. “When she didn’t improve, she went back, but they told her to give the tablets more time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She continued, “Not long after that she followed my stepdad, Dave, downstairs one evening and forgot why she was there.

It was two days after Halloween, and my 44th birthday party at Lion’s Roar Karaoke House in Williamsburg was already in full swing. Younger attendees sang along with gusto to hits that were popular when they were in their 20s in the 2010s. During that decade, I was too occupied with reproduction and its consequences to pay much attention to the inexorable rise of Ariana Grande. Toward the end of the party, I performed “What’s Up,” by 4 Non Blondes, a song I’ve been karaokeing ever since its opening lines — “Twenty-five years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope / for a destination” — were literally true. “Forty-four years and my life is still,” I sang that night. I spent the week after the party feeling hung-over, though I’m sober. When I looked at the photos of me at the mic, it was hard not to compare them to a slideshow my mother had sent me a few weeks earlier on my actual birthday. I’m pretty sure her collection had been automatically generated by Apple’s facial-recognition algorithm, but it still felt like an attack. In all of the pictures, some of which were taken with my mom’s first iPhone 14 years ago, I was so cute, so bright-eyed, so thin, so &lt;em&gt;young.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757by00133b7802q8t578@published" data-word-count="152"&gt;Of course, I am still relatively young, at least compared to how old I hope to be in the future. And I’m often told that I don’t look my age, which is probably because of the way I dress (casual-disheveled) and how many tattoos I have, two of which are Gen-Z-coded stick-and-pokes rather than millennial-coded full color. But it’s also because the full impact of middle age hasn’t slapped me across the face yet. I might be deluding myself, but I feel like I still credibly blend in among my younger co-workers. The illusion isn’t punctured unless we start reminiscing about high school. Once, in a meeting, I mentioned that my school had put stricter security measures in place “after Columbine” and fleetingly saw the “Sure, Grandma, let’s get you to bed” meme flash across my colleagues’ faces. Mostly, over the past few years, I have felt like an old young person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757de00143b78jwv855da@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;The feeling seems pretty common in my generation. We are in some senses younger than every middle-aged cohort before us. It’s been much more difficult for older millennials and cusp X-ers to attain the career status our parents had at our ages. Many live without a financial safety net, keeping us young in the “furniture from the street” way. We’re less likely to own homes or have emergency savings. When layoffs come around, both the high-powered boomers above us and the less-pricey Gen-Z kids on their way up are more likely to hang on to their jobs — at least until AI replaces the kids, then us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757f100153b78m6g4rgww@published" data-word-count="170"&gt;It’s also possible, though expensive, for us to appear far younger than our parents did at our ages via Botox, fillers, and those red-light LED masks that make you look like a scary robot. We’ve all seen that photo of 70-year-old Kris Jenner looking 25; with enough money, we know we can opt out of many physical signs of our decrepitude. We might dress younger than our power-suited mothers did. Grown-ups are no longer identifiable via business-casual uniforms and staid haircuts; the pandemic has erased many offices’ taboo against wearing soft pants. If we want, we’re deluged with all the information in the world about what young people are wearing, listening to, reading, saying, and doing the moment we open our apps. We can swim in the same waters as them, and we often do without even thinking about it: TV shows based on YA novels or set in high schools are just as popular with 40-somethings as they are with viewers in the age bracket of the characters onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757gp00163b78lmoql9yd@published" data-word-count="207"&gt;Add to all this: The world doesn’t really treat us like old people anymore. When we were kids, 40 was famously “over the hill.” To me, 40 felt more like another journalistic deadline I was blowing; there were lots of things I’d hoped to have achieved by that point in my life, but I would just have to ask the universe for an extension. I didn’t think about my body falling apart or my mortality as much as I mourned the loss of my identity as a precocious person. I’d spent my 20s being the youngest person in the meeting, an interloper in the world of established Gen-X-ers, racing to publish my first book before I turned 30. Then I spent my 30s recovering from and atoning for everything I’d said and done in service of my ambition, and reproducing. Soon after my 40th birthday, I got a full-time job for the first time in eight years and was suddenly a decade older than some of my bosses. No one accorded me the respect owed to an elder stateswoman; I was competing for the same opportunities as the 26-year-olds who shared my job description but not my extracurricular responsibilities, who were then 4 and 7 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757i800173b78ea5gqnqo@published" data-word-count="247"&gt;Regardless of how emotionally young or old I felt, I was heading for an aging milestone. While people were no longer rolling over the hill at 40, the new received wisdom said I’d soon be arriving at something more extreme: the cliff. The term entered the lexicon last year with Miranda July’s novel &lt;em&gt;All Fours&lt;/em&gt; — which featured a diagram of the abrupt nosedive women’s hormones take sometime in our fourth decade — and the concept was expanded and reinforced by the publication that August of a widely discussed “nonlinear aging” study from Stanford. That research seemed to confirm something we already sort of knew: There are certain years in life when aging hits us hard and moves us forward at hyperspeed. Forty-four, according to the study, is the first of those years. Sixty is the next, and there may yet be more cliffs to be discovered. The Stanford scientists found these transition points by examining the markers of cellular aging in roughly 100 people between the ages of 25 and 75. Over the course of the study’s 12-year duration, they discovered these markers became increasingly dysregulated in bursts around certain ages. At first, they were skeptical that 44 was a true aberration, thinking that perimenopausal symptoms must be skewing their results. But when they broke the data out by sex, they found that men were experiencing the same key changes women were: increased risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced ability to metabolize fat, alcohol, and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757ko00183b78izjdoyei@published" data-word-count="260"&gt;I first read the study about six months before my 44th birthday. Mostly, it made me feel guilty and scared. At 43, I wasn’t exactly being proactive about my physical health. Some of the factors were out of my control — or at least they felt that way. I was on a cocktail of medications for bipolar disorder that all had sedative effects; no matter how much coffee I drank, I couldn’t seem to muster the energy to do something as ambitious as “going to the gym.” Besides, I had no time: I spent every waking hour either taking care of my kids or working, the exception being a brief period between 9:30 and 11 p.m. that I spent watching TV with my husband in a semi-prone position on the couch. Caffeine was my god. Nicotine, I’m ashamed to admit, was also my god in the form of Juul pods. Cutting out refined sugar seemed like the first step toward a Goop-ian nightmare with orthorexia at its inevitable end point. GLP-1’s were for rich people. My lifestyle wasn’t exactly a point of pride, but I didn’t see how I could be expected to do much better. Between constant deadlines and family stressors, my central nervous system was in a perpetual state of near collapse. My periods had been weird for several years. And underneath it all was low-level dread that this was just the beginning of my irreversible decline. Whether I fell off the cliff or not, I’d still be lucky to reach 88. I was in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

The media coverage of the Stanford study was no different. Much of it suggested that the cliff might be preventable or at least could be delayed. But the potential remedies offered were cold comfort: They were the commonsensical things doctors always recommend — get enough sleep, reduce stress, exercise moderately with an emphasis on strength training, stop eating refined sugar and processed food. Boring! Also: Impossible?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757sd001b3b78amalqnny@published" data-word-count="193"&gt;I wondered what the study’s researchers thought of this, and I also didn’t feel totally confident that I’d comprehended the paper — which includes sentences like “Phosphatidylinositols are a class of phospholipids that have various roles in cytoskeleton organization” — so I called Dr. Michael Snyder, its senior author. Answering the phone, he told me I’d caught him just as he’d finished his morning exercise routine, which includes both cardio and strength training. The study is ongoing, and Snyder is himself a formal participant, getting his own samples analyzed along with the others. He told me he doesn’t believe that the aging cliffs are an immutable fact of biology. The changes he and his team documented, he said, are a representation of what currently is, not what might potentially be. If people go into their late 30s and 40s with the understanding that their bodies are going to distinctly change — that they’re not going to be able to get by merely doing what they’ve always done — then they have a chance to improve their outcomes. So far, the study has not provided any meaningful conclusions about whether this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757tu001c3b78suoq6qji@published" data-word-count="201"&gt;Snyder’s take fits comfortably with the orthodoxy of our time: that our health is adaptable, that everything is possible if we look, if we research, if we try. But the reality of aging is evident all around us. In the months before I turned 44, I talked to quite a few people who had already crossed that threshold, the first drop. They talked about injuries and illnesses and some bodily changes that had never even crossed my mind. Multiple people mentioned plantar fasciitis, inflammation of the band of tissue on the sole of the foot. My days walking around barefoot, which I’d been taking completely for granted, were apparently numbered. “My feet just stopped working last year,” said Samantha Tunis, 45. “I took a dance class and felt great during, and then the next day I couldn’t put any weight on my right foot.” Sufferers can experience pain so extreme that they have difficulty standing and walking, and there’s no quick fix. The same thing happened to Jana when she was 43; her condition was so bad that she needed physical therapy and oral steroids — and this was during the pandemic, when she was walking everywhere with her stroller-age son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757v7001d3b78vdtei5lv@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;I also heard from people who, at 44, had perfect vision one day and needed glasses the next. People who went from drinking three or four cocktails on a Thursday and waking up refreshed to being unable to tolerate more than a glass of wine without feeling hung-over for days. Women who felt like their skin texture had changed overnight, becoming saggy and crêpey instead of firm and taut. Several told me that they’d become basically unable to lose weight around 44, and some had turned to GLP-1’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757ws001e3b78xcpla1d5@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;The most dramatic story of sudden change was Allison Wright’s. At 43, she learned that she would need a double hip replacement. She’d previously been incredibly physically active: She loved spin, hot yoga, and Pilates, which she mixed with some weight training. But at 42, she noticed pains on the right side of her body, concentrated around her hip.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757yc001f3b7885n4xgtj@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;An initial MRI diagnosed her with gluteal tendinosis, a glute tear, a hamstring tear, and a labral tear, all on the left. She also learned she had previously undiagnosed congenital hip dysplasia. The first orthopedic surgeon she talked to told her that, while her hips did need to be replaced, she was too young for the surgery — she would just need to replace them again in 20 years or so, when she’d be older and more susceptible to complications. Wright resolved to look for a surgeon who would give her the relief she needed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors have told her not to engage in any physical activity more strenuous than walking, and even then, she’s not supposed to walk on “uneven surfaces,” a constant challenge in hilly Charlottesville, Virginia, where she lives. On a recent vacation, she found she needed the help of a cane to navigate the sand at the beach. She has to bring a padded cushion into restaurants because of the damage to her glutes. Her physical struggles have affected every aspect of her life, including her sex life and her relationship with her family.&lt;/p&gt;

In April, she underwent a surgery to shave off the top of her left femur, which has mitigated some of her pain without requiring a full hip replacement. Still, she is deeply bothered that there isn’t a clear explanation for what happened to her. “All the doctors, all the physical therapists, they always ask, ‘Was it an impact injury? How did this happen?’ And I can’t point to anything. I was very active, working with trainers. My body just started to fall apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758ge001l3b78d4xpqgqo@published" data-word-count="126"&gt;I called a well-known gynecologist, Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, to get her read on how gender fits into nonlinear aging and also to sneakily get her permission to seek out hormone-replacement therapy. I’d been hearing and reading that it was beginning to be prescribed to women who are, like me, in the early stages of perimenopause (the eight-to-ten years before your periods stop completely, as you know if you’ve read any of the 10 million articles or novels recently published on the subject). Poynor has written extensively on the need to separate obstetrics and gynecology to allow doctors to focus on women who’ve aged out of the concerns endemic to the reproductive years. She has also treated Martha Stewart. I was very eager to hear her take.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758i0001m3b78vhvvk2je@published" data-word-count="165"&gt;When she first read the Stanford study, Poynor told me, she was unsurprised that the changes it reported would be seen in women around 44 — it was somewhat intuitive given their fluctuating hormones and declining ovarian reserve. She’s an advocate for starting hormone-replacement therapy earlier rather than later. “We know that starting estrogen is associated with a lower level of insulin resistance,” she said. “So it does help to support metabolism.” Like Snyder, she detailed how important sleep, stress reduction, and regular exercise are, but I was more focused on finding a magic pill I could start taking. When July’s &lt;em&gt;All Fours&lt;/em&gt; heroine starts smearing progesterone cream on her thigh, it changes her life and her body, helping her transform from a thwarted artist in a settled-down hetero marriage into a horny gym rat who videotapes herself performing elaborate dance routines and only dates non-men. My own ambitions were more modest, but I still wanted to see what hormone therapy could do for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758jh001n3b78gigdrtw6@published" data-word-count="169"&gt;My psychiatrist gave me a recommendation for a gynecologist who specialized in perimenopause and didn’t take my insurance. The initial appointment was $1,200, but it was also an hour long, including 45 minutes of chitchat about my medical history that delved into areas like my astrological chart and my relationship to my mother. The gynecologist, by that point my new spiritual guru, did bloodwork and found that both my estrogen and my progesterone could stand to be topped up. After some trial and error — including a low-dose birth-control pill with synthetic progesterone that made me immediately depressed — I settled into a regime of bioidentical estrogen patches, applied weekly four times a month, and bioidentical progesterone, taken during the last two weeks of my cycle. A few months into the new system, my cycles were exactly 28 days long for the first time in four years, and I no longer spent days 14 to 22 convinced that all my friends hated me and my life’s ambitions were doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758l1001o3b78zvqrnken@published" data-word-count="209"&gt;My appearance was going to be harder to hack. Out of the gate, I had a big advantage (knock wood): I have naturally plump cheeks and a smooth forehead, the genetic inheritance of my father and his mother, who both looked about 40 well into their 60s. I’ve never been tempted to try Botox. From the neck down, it’s a different story. I’d spent most of my adult life as a medium-thin person, thanks to a speedy metabolism and a freelance/intermittently employed writer’s schedule that left plenty of time for exercise. Then, with my first pregnancy, I experienced diastasis recti, where the midline of your abdominal muscles basically unzips (disgusting). Even though I did extensive physical therapy to get my abs to reunite, they never quite got all the way back together and then I got pregnant again. I have long arms and legs proportionate to my torso, and the bulge in my midsection has gotten me seats on the subway for years. I’ve tried not to let it bother me. But this became more difficult after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed antipsychotics in 2022. I gained an intractable 30 pounds almost instantaneously after going on the drugs, even though nothing about my diet had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758mf001p3b78ihif5m4l@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;For years, I have attempted to hypnotize myself into body positivity, or at least body neutrality, even as I’ve had to buy increasingly larger clothes. I subscribe to newsletters about the harmful effects of diet culture and the misogyny of big pharma, and I believe wholeheartedly that health is possible at any weight. And yet. When my new gynecologist asked me, in an offhand way, how I would feel about losing 30 pounds, somehow the first words that came out of my mouth emerged directly from my hindbrain: “It would feel like getting an extra $30,000 in my paycheck.” She didn’t hesitate to prescribe me Mounjaro. I didn’t meet my insurance’s criteria for GLP-1 coverage — my A1C, a measure of average blood-sugar levels, firmly indicated that I wasn’t prediabetic in the slightest, and my BMI didn’t qualify me as obese. But I decided I was willing to pay out of pocket, within reason. My gynecologist sent the prescription to a Canadian pharmacy so I could get the drug for around half its American cost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758o4001q3b78dm5unq1j@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;My honest review of Mounjaro is that it put me in a really weird headspace. Typically, I love food, even mediocre food; being hungry and then being satisfied is one of the very few small, reliable pleasures in my life. So the first few days of simply not feeling hungry at all, ever, were a mindfuck. I still ate because I understood, intellectually, that my body required sustenance. I came around on the appeal of things like smoothies and açai bowls — nonfoods you could consume without much effort or conscious thought at a desk or while scrolling through your phone. Mounjaro also made me so constipated that I resorted at one point to a message-board-recommended Israeli laxative that had roughly the same effect as colonoscopy-prep solution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758te001r3b78vqxuz9o7@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;After tariffs kicked in, importing Mounjaro from Canada became almost as expensive as paying full price, and in three months of taking 2.5 milligrams a week, I’d lost only three pounds. Overall, I would give the drug two out of five stars, and those stars are simply because the glimmer of hope associated with the decision to try it compelled me to join the Y and start swimming again and to go to one medium-intensity yoga class a week.&lt;/p&gt;

I quit vaping and started chewing nicotine gum and smoking the occasional cigarette instead, reasoning that cigarettes’ finite and meditative aspects were preferable to ingesting a near-constant stream of chemical vapor. We could generously call this a harm-reduction approach. I talked to my psychiatrist and began to taper down gradually on the most sedating of my various sedatives. Like all body-optimization projects, this is a work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

Where is the line between a wholesome level of self-care and an obsessive, Pyrrhic war against an indomitable enemy? Consumer culture shouts at us constantly that we can always be doing more: We can hack our bodies, gathering data to improve almost everything about ourselves. But we’re also told that acceptance is the path toward peace and contentment. I thought about the older women I know, the ones well past middle age who seemed to have found a way to avoid being made insane by these contradictions. How had they become truly “older and wiser”?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758yv001v3b78hw2jxqfd@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;I became friendly with Kim France, age 61, a couple years ago, when she and author Jennifer Romolini had me as a guest on their podcast, &lt;em&gt;Everything Is Fine, &lt;/em&gt;which is itself about navigating the second half of life&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Once upon a time, France was a staff writer at now-legendary &lt;em&gt;Sassy&lt;/em&gt; magazine. From there on, she had a thriving career in journalism — one that nearly took her out. She has written with skill and clarity about the soul-killing depression that she experienced at her professional pinnacle at &lt;em&gt;Lucky&lt;/em&gt; magazine, which she founded in 2000. In 2005, overworked, she had a manic episode that landed her in a psych unit. Though our lives don’t line up perfectly — France is partnered but happily child-free, and I’ve never had a Condé Nast car and driver or owned a townhouse — I’ve always felt I have a lot to learn from her example, particularly the way she’s reinvented herself throughout the decades while still coping with the inevitable ups and downs of life with chronic mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq75902001w3b781w2e1bmw@published" data-word-count="262"&gt;France wanted to reassure me that life is better for her now than it was in her 40s or even her 50s. Part of the reason, she said, is that she no longer feels “like an old person trying to be young.” She’d crossed over, she said, to being “a young old person. I’m in the freshman class.” More profoundly, she told me, a great equalizing has taken place: Most of her contemporaries have experienced life’s harshest realities. “If you get to be my age,” she said, “pretty much everyone has kind of walked through the fiery valley at least once. Something terrible has happened to them, something traumatic, something they had to get over. And when you’re 44, that’s not true. There’s something to being an age where you’ve come out the other end of all the drama that gets stirred up in your 40s.” I thought about the connection I feel now with friends who’ve had their lives upended; I hadn’t considered it in those terms before. With friends who’ve been lucky enough to have avoided a major loss, a divorce, a brush with death, or any other “life before” and “life after” catastrophe, I keep the conversation light, the same way my friends who experienced tragedy before me used to do with me. That we would all one day be on the level, as France described it, was perversely reassuring. Even if it were possible to stay young and carefree forever, it would mean missing out on the kind of spiritual growth that comes only from passing through pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7591y001x3b78157kwj1r@published" data-word-count="170"&gt;While I see France as sort of an idealized older version of myself, I’ve never been delusional enough to even aspire to be like Genevieve “Genny” Kapuler, who should be pictured under &lt;em&gt;older and wiser&lt;/em&gt; in the dictionary. I met her in my 20s, when I spent a lot of time doing alignment-based Iyengar yoga, the best kind for people, like me, who have scoliosis. When I got a six-figure book deal at 28, the first thing I did was enroll in yoga-teacher training (grad school for the especially feckless). I was fascinated by Kapuler, who is now in her late 70s and still guiding several classes a week. She has always seemed like the happiest, most youthful-spirited older person I’ve ever met. At an age when most people who do physical work are retired, she’s still bounding around the room with the energy of a teenager. During her classes, held in her enormous Soho loft (thrilling), she would adjust my postures with a gentle touch that felt like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7593e001y3b78ec7grp2p@published" data-word-count="238"&gt;Kapuler has never been terribly concerned with her aging body. “I would say physically my joints are stiffer. There’s a lot of poses I can’t do,” she told me. “I don’t do drop backs anymore.” (She means backbends that start from a standing position and end with one’s hands on the floor, spine arched into full wheel pose.) “I don’t want to hurt myself.” But in terms of her “perception,” she said, “that which I love, that which I find beautiful, that which gives me more inspiration — that gets stronger every day.” Kapuler also doesn’t romanticize youth. “I didn’t feel that being young was so easy,” she said. Her 30s and 40s were full of joy — the birth of her son, her beginnings as a teacher — but also full of sadness with the deaths of her parents and the ineludible challenges of raising a child. On the whole, she’s much more at peace now that she’s older. “I’m not being Pollyanna about it,” she said. “I accept how complex and difficult it is to be a human being in this world. But on the other hand, if I stay focused on that which I feel is worthy of my attention, I am content.” Talking to her makes me feel as though, if I focus on the aspects of life that I love, the way she does, I have a chance at the enlightenment she radiates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7594p001z3b78mvys26bi@published" data-word-count="262"&gt;Joyce Maynard, the 72-year-old memoirist and novelist, is another older person who has continued to work steadily, teaching and writing and publishing books. Despite, or maybe as a reaction to, a difficult childhood and the mixed impact of early fame, she’s a constitutional optimist. She’s also preternaturally vigorous and energetic, which she chalks up to good luck and good genes. When we spoke recently, she was about to take a cross-country camping trip with her boyfriend. “I’ll name my energy as a crucial aspect of what has gotten me through difficult things in life,” she said. “But that said, I also hugely believe it has to do with one’s attitude and approach. And I’ve witnessed this in countless women.” She runs a memoir-writing retreat workshop for women in Central America, which keeps her in touch with younger people, and she  said she’s continually learning new things. “I’ve had the great privilege of hearing and helping to shape many, many women’s stories, often stories that were very private and personal to them. It’s definitely expanded my understanding of the world and all the different things that happen in people’s lives.” In her later career, she’s experienced a newfound sense of freedom. When she was my age, she told me, “I gave myself over to my children. I did my career with whatever was left of me after taking care of everybody else, which I think was a story for a lot of women.” Now that her children are well launched into the world, she’s focusing on teaching and writing with a new vitality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7596900203b78qtyvcozo@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;Approaching the second half of life this way is a choice, Maynard said. “You can either be left in the dust looking around, or you say, &lt;em&gt;Well, now who am I? What do I want?&lt;/em&gt;” She said she knew her vigor couldn’t last forever. “Obviously, something’s going to get me, but until it does I’m going to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7597h00213b78viglubwy@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;For Kim, Genny, and Joyce, 44 was the beginning of an exciting, albeit exacting, new phase of life. Staying young is in some part a matter of appreciating the opportunity to get old. It also requires being grateful for what you have while you have it — however limited it might seem compared to the past. If I’m lucky, I’ll look back on 44 and reminisce about how youthful I was then; how much fun it was to lead a rough-and-tumble life with my husband and our two irrepressible kids, how I could still get hit on by bodega guys if I wore heels and eyeliner. But I have plenty to look forward to (besides plantar fasciitis). “Forty-four years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope,” I sang at my party. Maybe the ground is about to drop, but I’m setting my sights on singing “88 years and my life is still …”&lt;/p&gt;

It was the combination of a hobby and the possibility of delivering actionable insights to others,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: andreswd via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;andreswd via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Previous studies show [listening to music] improves processing speed, language, memory and coordination,” Jaffa told HuffPost. “Plus, it often involves socializing with others, which helps protect brain health.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaffa said the question she gets most often about the study is, “Are some genres of music more beneficial than others?” Is Coltrane or Clapton superior when it comes to improving cognitive function? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she doesn’t have the answer (participants weren’t asked about what they were listening to), she said it’s definitely something she wants to explore in future research. (That and if listening to music has any bearing on reducing the risk of cognitive decline for those younger than 70.) &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that researchers like Ryan and Jaffa are exploring this topic, given how devastating dementia symptoms can be. People with the condition may develop speech difficulties, memory loss, mood changes and trouble completing everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another recent study, published in October &lt;a href="https://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481(25)00354-9/abstract" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69308b68e4b02cf3b175c7b6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481(25)00354-9/abstract" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, found that having a sense of purpose may protect against dementia by keeping the brain more resilient and is linked to a lower risk of developing it.

The reimplementation of masks represents the most significant revival of a &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/covid-19"&gt;pandemic-era protocol since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted&lt;/a&gt;. Officials stress that this move is preventative, designed to alleviate strain on hospitals already burdened with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several regions, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/world-news"&gt;including Aragón and Andalucía, have already started recommending or enforcing mask usage&lt;/a&gt; in hospitals and nursing homes. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/159768/americans-react-mask-mandates-eight-states"&gt;The Health Ministry is now set to roll out a standardized protocol across all 17 autonomous communities&lt;/a&gt;. While the rules will be uniform, regions will have the flexibility to tweak measures based on local infection rates, hospital capacity, and flu prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the forthcoming guidelines, masks will be compulsory for patients, visitors, and staff in hospitals, primary care centers, and residential care facilities in high-risk areas, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/entire-european-country-brings-back-36343221" rel="nofollow"&gt;reports the Daily Star.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facilities treating immunocompromised patients and nursing homes will be given priority due to the elevated risk of severe complications. While masks are still strongly recommended for individuals with symptoms, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions outside of healthcare settings, they won't be mandatory unless local authorities raise their alert level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For expats residing in Spain, this reintroduction of mask mandates in medical facilities means they'll need to have face coverings on hand when visiting hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes. Given that regional authorities may enforce rules differently, expats are encouraged to stay informed by checking updates from both national and regional health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain is also ramping up its flu vaccination drive. Senior citizens, healthcare professionals, and individuals with underlying health issues are being urged to get their flu shots as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials maintain that a combination of vaccination, mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and proper ventilation is the most effective strategy to curb transmission, hospital admissions, and severe cases. They emphasize that self-isolating when ill remains crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder" class="loaded"&gt;&lt;mantis-ui-widget id="mantis-recommender-wrapper" data-config="{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't miss&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;adsEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;leaderBoardEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/mantis-ui-widget&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health is optimistic that early intervention will prevent hospitals from reaching capacity as flu cases increase.

                &lt;p&gt;From a young age, Katelyn Jonozzo took pride in being very active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until she was 18, she practiced gymnastics 4 to 5 days a week. "I loved the discipline, I loved having a regimented schedule," Jonozzo, 31, told Business Insider. "That instilled how important health and fitness are to your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her 20s, she gravitated toward &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-ran-my-first-marathon-advice-mistakes-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;marathon running&lt;/a&gt;. A supply chain analyst, Jonozzo would regularly wake up at 4 or 5 am to lift for two hours and run before going to work. In 2024, she qualified to run the Boston Marathon. She couldn't wait to run it in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was before she felt a sudden, sharp stomach pain in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonozzo started experiencing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and throwing up. She chalked it up to norovirus, which was going around at the time in her Cleveland suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My stomach started to get really, really bloated — I looked like I was almost pregnant," Jonozzo said. "But that was also a symptom of norovirus, so I kind of just lumped it into that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pain got worse — stabbing sensations in her sides and nonstop vomiting — her two best friends urged her to go to the ER instead of waiting another day. Jonozzo complied,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;assuming the worst-case scenario was appendicitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an emergency surgery to remove part of her colon, she learned she had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3 colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with secondary cancer in her abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonozzo said her training mindset helped her navigate her new reality. "I'm definitely a tunnel-vision person," she said. "I think I cried for about 30 seconds. Then, I looked back at the doctor, and I was like, 'What's the plan? What do we do?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="03e3a7f4-6529-424c-9055-37bf247b6912" data-toc-id="03e3a7f4-6529-424c-9055-37bf247b6912"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Jonozzo never experienced symptoms of colon cancer prior to her hospitalization.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Katelyn Jonozzo
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonozzo said she was initially dismissed when she went to the hospital and told she might just have a stomachache or gassiness. She insisted that she had a high pain tolerance and wouldn't come in unless it was serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she had an MRI done, which revealed a three-inch tumor on her colon — one that was about to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the next 48 hours, she had an emergency colostomy that removed one-third of her colon and installed a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colostomy bag&lt;/a&gt;. "I was just in so much shock and so much was going on that I didn't really know what was happening," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovering from a catatonic state for 10 days, she learned her exact diagnosis. Her doctor estimated that the tumor had been growing for about a decade, Jonozzo recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How have I been running marathons?" she said. "How have I been working out when I had a tumor on my stomach?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3e851f51-474d-47e6-86b3-9eb6036a5532" data-toc-id="3e851f51-474d-47e6-86b3-9eb6036a5532"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working out with a colostomy bag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Jonozzo said it took some time to get used to her colostomy bag.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Katelyn Jonozzo
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weeks after the surgery, Jonozzo began her &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-true-hidden-cost-price-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chemotherapy treatments&lt;/a&gt;. At first, she stayed positive: making poster boards with affirmations to leave around her house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It still didn't really ever sink in, the journey that I was about to go through, until I would say probably around three or four of chemo," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that point, she started to lose her hair and taste, experience skin changes, and develop neuropathy, losing sensations in her hands and feet. "That's when I realized, 'Ok, you have cancer. This is not just something that we're going to duck our head down and go through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge was working out. During treatment, her usual routine was out of the question. "I definitely had to tone everything down," she said. She swapped long training runs and weightlifting for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-spending-more-time-outside-is-healthy-2017-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;outdoor walks&lt;/a&gt; and three-mile jogs.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Jonozzo said outdoor walks and being in nature helped her stay positive during treatment.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Katelyn Jonozzo
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle was the colostomy bag. "I was obviously super self-conscious about the bag in the beginning," she said. But as she started to connect with other young cancer patients through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://touchedbycancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;The Gathering Place&lt;/a&gt; support group and the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://colorectalcancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, she began to embrace the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would go to the pool in a bathing suit, with the bag out, or I would lift my shirt up at the gym and let people know that the bag was there, which I guess made me just gain confidence," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for the positives helped her keep up her normal routine as much as she could. "I think it's amazing that they found out how to pull your intestine out and you could still go to the bathroom," she said. "It's a great contraption, if you ask me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dd63d57b-8da9-4e0f-bdd8-a772a4b47432" data-toc-id="dd63d57b-8da9-4e0f-bdd8-a772a4b47432"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She's running a marathon with her cancer support group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Jonozzo ringing the bell in September once her treatment was officially finished.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Katelyn Jonozzo
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After seven months of treatment, Jonozzo was deemed cancer-free. She finished chemotherapy in August and had a colostomy reversal in November. In mid-December, her first screening since finishing treatment, she'll learn more about her future screening schedule, which she already knows will include &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;two colonoscopies&lt;/a&gt; a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She'll also be officially cleared to work out after her surgery — and is eager to go back to her old routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a little nervous just because normally I can just pop out and run and do those things, but I have to take baby steps back into it," she said. She plans to run three marathons in 2026, with the hopes of re-qualifying for Boston through one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's especially excited for the Cleveland Marathon in May. She'll run it as the team captain for her cancer fundraising group, which she said awakened new passions in her. "I love advocating, I love talking to people," she said. "I've always loved doing that — I just didn't have the confidence to do so before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just one of the ways that her &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cancer-work-career-impact-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer experience&lt;/a&gt; changed her, she said, along with becoming more present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People think I'm crazy for saying this, but I truly believe it was one of the best things that ever happened to me," she said. "I would not trade this experience for anything. I really wouldn't."&lt;/p&gt;
            
            
            &lt;/section&gt;

Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/covid-shot-access-coverage-at-stake-as-rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-meets-.html"&gt;vaccine committee&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to vote&lt;/a&gt; Thursday on whether to change a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/how-to-get-covid-mmrv-hepatitisb-vaccines.html"&gt;longstanding recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot entirely. The group&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt; tabled a vote &lt;/a&gt;on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But either change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that," Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;driving down infections in kids by 99%&lt;/a&gt; since then. Maniar called that a "remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing" if the committee changes the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;up to states&lt;/a&gt; to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-malone-cdc-vaccine-committee.html"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the jab is "an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks," Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine," said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;still recommends&lt;/a&gt; the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because "it saves lives," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK/"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt; manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Merck during the panel's September meeting pushed back on changing the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases," Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOY3ZHTS1jTXMwRnY3TnpFSmJScmhwN3djcWVtaFFoWU1JaHdSU3RtRnExdFJacnYtZlNudU1abVFVb2xEN1NxdmVyX1VCdHdncVQxcTFrdUUwZEZNSG9ZR3RJV1pENDFpVmNqQ3ZCRTAzX2o3Q283TmZ6U1pIcDAteNIBhgFBVV95cUxOV0pkckF3d2ZGODd1WVFUbjU4R3ltVjNZTFpIYlEzdW5MbXlMT2JYb3h4cmxQVGdVbUVBV1VQWUt1RTBRa3dMemJGU014STJ2OTNKWW9OYVRkWVZRUlV0bkhxREhsYWhNQkRXWUk3M3dscExVcTh5VHR0RzN6bXJrX2pON3ZUUQ</guid></item><item><title>乙型肝炎：父母应了解的病毒和疫苗的信息- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629168/hepatitis-b-vaccine-kids-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                The hepatitis B virus attacks the liver. Hepatitis B has no cure, and chronic infection can lead to serious outcomes such as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than three decades, it has been routine to give all newborns in the U.S. the hepatitis B vaccine. That could soon change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to vote Thursday on whether to rescind that universal recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If that happens, pediatricians say, the health consequences could be dire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It would be extremely dangerous," &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/andrew-t-pavia" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Andrew Pavia&lt;/a&gt; told NPR this year. He's a professor of pediatrics and medicine with the University of Utah and a pediatric and adult infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802" target="_blank"&gt;attacks the liver&lt;/a&gt;. The disease has no cure, and chronic infection can lead to serious outcomes such as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. And the risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"About 25% of children who develop chronic hepatitis B will die of their infection," says Pavia, who is also a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Delaying the birth dose by just two months could result in at least 1,400 additional preventable cases of hepatitis B for each year the revised recommendation is in place, &lt;a href="https://hepvu.org/news-updates/new-analysis-shows-delaying-the-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-may-lead-to-thousands-of-preventable-infections-and-hundreds-of-millions-in-avoidable-healthcare-costs/" target="_blank"&gt;according to a new analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Delaying the vaccine until age 12, as President &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5553541/trump-advises-parents-on-hepatitis-b-vaccine-heres-why-doctors-say-hes-wrong" target="_blank"&gt;Trump suggested&lt;/a&gt; this year, could result in at least 2,700 preventable infections each year, the analysis found. The study was released prior to peer review, ahead of this week's meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the U.S. began universally vaccinating newborns in 1991, some 18,000 children a year would become infected before age 10. About half were infected through mother-to-child transmission, Pavia says. Giving newborns the shot right after birth prevents the virus from taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other half of kids got infected from somewhere else. Trump said hepatitis B is sexually transmitted — which is one means of transmission — so there's no reason to give the vaccine to a baby. But Pavia says the risks for kids are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There have been cases of infections in day care. There have been cases of infection on sports teams. There have been documented infections from shared toothbrushes and from shared razors," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The virus is found in blood, saliva, semen and other bodily fluids, even tears, and it can live on surfaces for up to seven days. A child with a wound who comes into contact with that surface — even days later — could become infected, says &lt;a href="https://www.anitakpatelmd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and pediatric critical care physician in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Chronic%20hepatitis%20B%20*%20CDC%20estimates%20that,as%20the%20rate%20among%20non%2DHispanic%20White%20people." target="_blank"&gt;half of people infected with hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; don't know they have the virus, but Patel says they can still pass on the virus unwittingly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have a cut, that blood could potentially get on the infant," Patel says. "And if that infant has any sort of break in their skin — as infants, frankly, frequently do — they can then get hepatitis B," says Patel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aasld.org/the-liver-meeting/speakers/su-h-wang-122984#:~:text=Biography,AASLD%20HBV%20Guidelines%20Writing%20group." target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Su Wang&lt;/a&gt; says she suspects she got infected with hepatitis B as an infant through her grandparents. She says they likely got exposed through their jobs as medical workers in Taiwan. Taiwan used to have very high rates of hepatitis B infection among adults before it began a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7472725/#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20program%20has%20been,abdominal%20ultrasonography%20are%20performed%20regularly." target="_blank"&gt;successful national vaccination&lt;/a&gt; program in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When I was born, they came over to help, like a lot of grandparents do, and they lived with us," Wang says. "They became primary caregivers for the first month of life. And so very likely that's how I got hep B."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wang is now an internist and researcher specializing in hepatitis at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says it's very important to give the shot at birth. Since vaccination of newborns became routine in the U.S., case rates have plummeted 99% among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we started doing this as universal for all kids, you saw this blanket protection that protected an entire generation of kids," Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These SCFAs can influence the activity of both cancer-promoting (proto-oncogenes) and cancer-suppressing (tumor-suppressor) genes by modifying histones, the proteins that help package DNA. By making the DNA more accessible, SCFAs can turn certain genes on or off, depending on the cell type and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has shown that butyrate inhibits enzymes known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383523000345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;histone deacetylases (HDACs)&lt;/a&gt;, which can result in changes that slow tumor cell growth or even trigger their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while it is still advisable to eat plenty of fiber-rich foods, it is important to note that this was a cell-and animal-based study.

Therefore, interpreting the results is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that milk may support a healthier, more diverse gut microbiome, while cheese might have the opposite effect. However, it is important to note the small sample size, self-reported data, and predominantly older male cohort in the study. More research is necessary before issuing broad dietary guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521691823000069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted that the food people consume is one of the most significant influences on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large-scale study of over 21,000 people in the U.S., U.K. and Italy, published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01870-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vegan-vegetarian-omnivore-diet-type-quality-gut-health" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;quality and diversity of the diet&lt;/a&gt; — rather than the dietary pattern itself — has the biggest impact on the structure of the gut microbiome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omnivore dietary patterns generally showed greater overall bacterial diversity, but also had higher abundances of bacteria associated with meat digestion and conditions like IBD and colorectal cancer. However, the presence of these bacteria does not necessarily mean a person will develop disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns typically had higher levels of gut microbes linked with fiber fermentation, especially bacteria that produce SCFAs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research notes that people following an omnivorous eating plan that consumed plenty of diverse, high-fiber plant foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables and whole grains, also had elevated levels of beneficial microbes, comparable to those seen in vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0019081/Curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nicola Segata&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor and principal investigator at the Department of Cellular, Computational, and Integrative Biology (CIBIO) at Università di Trento in Italy, is the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segata is also on the advisory board and a consultant for the personalized nutrition program company ZOE Limited, who partly funded the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The greater the variety of plant-based foods we consume, the greater the diversity of beneficial microbes in our gut.

&lt;p&gt;Two cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been confirmed in France in individuals who recently returned from travel abroad, according to the French Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said the infections were identified after both patients developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV and were found to have traveled together to the Arabian Peninsula, according to &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2025/12/04/deux-cas-de-coronavirus-mers-identifies-en-france-sur-des-personnes-de-retour-de-l-etranger_6655935_3244.html"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Minister Stéphanie Rist said the patients are being treated in the hospital as a precaution and that their conditions are stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rist said measures have been implemented to limit the risk of transmission, including contact tracing, testing, isolation, and precautionary steps for anyone who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bnone-in-content-4" id="bnone-286855448"&gt;&lt;div class="advert-block"&gt;
	&lt;span class="mvp-ad-label"&gt;Article continues below the player&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;p data-fuse="22691751352"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said no secondary transmission has been detected in France. Other individuals who took part in the same trip are being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MERS-CoV is a respiratory virus first identified in 2012 and is primarily associated with transmission from camels in countries on the Arabian Peninsula. Human-to-human spread can occur, particularly in healthcare settings, but sustained community transmission is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus causes severe respiratory illness in many cases, with symptoms that can include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. According to the World Health Organization, MERS has a high case-fatality rate compared to other coronaviruses, with about one-third of confirmed patients dying from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large outbreaks outside the Middle East have been rare but significant. In 2015, South Korea experienced a major hospital-associated outbreak linked to a traveler returning from the region, resulting in 186 cases and dozens of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemt9fz003k26p4gzkah67j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirty-eight-year-old Rosy Devi’s body aches most of the time, short walks have become difficult, she loses her breath easily, has chest pain and feels her health is generally getting worse. It has been a gradual decline, she says, since her hysterectomy in 2019 which led to her prematurely going through menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemvo5k00063b5zaxajejzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am walking and suddenly feel intense heat in my body and start sweating. And I get chest pain, like someone has hit me in the back,” says the mother of four who lives in India’s eastern state of Bihar. She never imagined the menopause, the time of life a woman stops getting her period permanently, would take such a toll on her body. “Now I am really feeling old. I mean, I feel that I have really become old… The body, the face, everything has changed,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000b3b5z6ibsi580@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Devi, menopause was also something she expected to experience much later in life, not because of surgery, so the whole thing came as quite a surprise, she admits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000c3b5zdyvvltkj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s a change that affects half the world’s population at some stage, and Devi’s symptoms are some of the wider-ranging and lesser-known effects that come with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000d3b5z0zad9tjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms such as hot flashes and mood changes are well known, and often stereotyped, but experts worldwide want to highlight that women face a huge range of changes to their bodies during the menopause – and lack of awareness means many will start experiencing symptoms without knowing why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwo6c000e3b5zdif95r6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what everyone needs to know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiemxuis000h3b5z8lhvoibf@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-is-menopause-and-why-dont-people-know-enough-about-it" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What is menopause – and why don’t people know enough about it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemwlab00093b5zofja3xqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause is when women experience an end to their periods, or menstruation, for more than 12 months, and it marks the end of their reproductive years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000m3b5z4jgejo45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, most women experience menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But a study of women in the United States and South Korea found that up to 9.4% of people (around 1 in 10) experience it between 40 and 44, while for up to 8.6% of people it happens before the age of 40. In very rare cases, women can go through menopause as early as their 20s. For some, it can occur following a full hysterectomy, including the removal of the ovaries, or due to other medical reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000n3b5zp8jiuvr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of natural menopause, the first stage is perimenopause. This is when the ovaries gradually produce fewer hormones, affecting menstrual cycles. Symptoms include irregular periods, hot flashes (also known as hot flushes), sleep disruption and mood changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000o3b5zb4kk9yxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perimenopause can begin as early as in the mid-30s, lasting for about four to eight years, but many women can’t recall when this started for them, explains Gayathri Delanerolle, a researcher with Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. In qualitative interviews, some women remember the exact time they experienced a hot flash or their sleep began to get worse, but others have no idea, she tells CNN. “Menopause has not even been on the radar.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000p3b5zt66gk2dd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that most women know little about menopause. One, which surveyed more than 800 postmenopausal women, the majority based in the UK, found that over 90% of them had never been taught about menopause at school, and almost half said they felt completely uninformed about it. The women also shared that their doctors lacked adequate knowledge, leaving them feeling “dismissed and unsupported” after their consultations. Other studies produced similar findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemyngi000q3b5ziytnwyb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Joyce Harper, a professor at University College London’s Institute of Women’s Health, who co-authored the study, told the College news outlet, the result shows “women have a lack of education about this key life stage… Together with a reported lack of education from their healthcare professionals, women may be left undiagnosed and unsupported.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiemz1bs000s3b5znij9kccb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="menopause-can-happen-in-many-ways-and-at-different-times" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Menopause can happen in many ways and at different times
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemy8id000k3b5z384pis16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause is classified as “premature” when it occurs before age 40, and “early” before the age 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000x3b5zc3733n0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research suggests, across low and middle-income countries, rates of early and premature menopause have risen and that the average age of menopause has fallen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000y3b5zqozjwxti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you get menopause early in your lifespan, you are struggling with that for a longer period of time,” says Nikita Rajput, a scientific officer at Tata Memorial Centre’s Centre for Cancer Epidemiology in Navi Mumbai, India.  Her research found that women in rural India faced “limited healthcare access, low awareness and higher rates of premature menopause,” she tells CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm000z3b5zvp50bxrc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other forms of menopause include surgical, which is triggered by a hysterectomy to remove the uterus and ovaries, and medical menopause, where treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy may affect the functioning of the ovaries and result in the onset of menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemznkm00103b5zcbi1zcgr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health experts in India have raised concerns about high rates of premature and early menopause in the country with research indicating its link to hysterectomies. This is particularly the case among young women from low-income, less educated and rural backgrounds. Rajput tells CNN that when these women are suffering with gynaecological disorders such as excessive bleeding or fibroids, they feel forced into hysterectomies, possibly under pressure from their husband or in-laws, or even doctors who may suggest the surgery as the first course of action. Research shows many women are unaware of the extent of the procedures they’ve had.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiemzcoj000v3b5ze9lt1xyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common symptoms of menopause are hot flashes and night sweats, occurring in 80% of cases, according to The Menopause Society in the US, but other common symptoms include vaginal dryness, urinary urgency, insomnia, and mood changes, including depression and irritability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x600193b5zfd3p6mjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Lots of women have also reported headaches, migraines…and difficulty sleeping or staying asleep,” says  Delanerolle. Many also experience incontinence which then impacts other aspects of their life, including work and exercising.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001a3b5zl3nm2mv6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, women may face symptoms such as heart palpitations, joint and muscle ache, changes in sex drive, poor concentration, weight gain and hair loss, according to the Mayo Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001b3b5zqviyxl8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other less common symptoms include dry eyes, while some women also report changes to their vision. They may also find themselves bruising more easily and suffer dry mouth or acne.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001c3b5zv5p3p8z3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delanerolle says she has come across other symptoms in her research, including itchy scalp and itchy skin. Some women in India and the UK even reported an increase in libido, she adds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001d3b5zokt3z7t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Menopause can be a highly individualized journey,” says Delanerolle, and because some symptoms are common in other health conditions, “sometimes it may not be possible to definitively think that these are related to menopause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien16x6001e3b5zykvwmby7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She believes what’s needed is comprehensive research, public awareness campaigns, including in schools, and evidence-based training for health care professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien0v9l00173b5zerpr15f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause and its symptoms last for around seven years on average, according to the Cleveland Clinic, and it’s important for women to be able to understand and identify what they are going through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001l3b5zjguv03qo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease following menopause, making it important that they become more active and manage their diet. This is because menopause causes a significant drop in estrogen – which works in regulating cholesterol and fat – increasing the risk of developing coronary heart disease or suffering a heart attack or stroke, according to the British Heart Foundation. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001m3b5zqc1asvp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple studies also show a greater risk of respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following menopause, particularly premature menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001n3b5zohkk4rvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Om Kurmi, associate professor in epidemiology and healthcare research at Coventry University in the UK, says greater awareness will help women get the correct support, and make the changes required in their lifestyle, to mitigate the health risks menopause brings with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001o3b5zqqtoumfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing exercise, reducing stress levels and losing weight can help with symptoms and combat the heightened risk of conditions such as osteoporosis and heart disease. Another area is mental health, which Kurmi says is “not discussed at all.” While symptoms of menopause such as irritability, mood swings and insomnia are well documented, there is also a heightened risk of depression and anxiety, as recent studies show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien2356001p3b5z40ze311d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women “need to recognize, if you’re having menopause, the likelihood of having certain health problems is higher compared to those who don’t,” Kurmi tells CNN. “Once you understand your symptoms … (these) can be managed well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        How can women manage menopause symptoms? And does this differ globally?
&lt;/h2&gt;

            The most prescribed care option for menopause worldwide is hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy or HRT, which works by replacing the hormones that have decreased inside the body. One is estrogen therapy – typically given to women who have had hysterectomies – and a second type is a combination of the hormones estrogen and progesterone, offered to others. Hormone therapy is thought to help mitigate symptoms and risks associated with menopause, and treatment typically lasts between two to five years, sometimes even longer. Stopping treatment may bring back menopausal symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien3lnx001y3b5z5a1vvvao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these therapies are more available in high-income countries due to cost, access to health care services, and knowledge among practitioners to then prescribe it. However, disparity is also seen within high-income countries, with the financially better off tending to have greater access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are some known side effects of hormone therapy, including irregular vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness, and an increased risk of blood clots and gall bladder disease. There is also a slight increase in the risk of breast, ovarian and endometrial (womb) cancer, but according to Cancer Research UK, the risk remains small, and depends on many factors, such as the type of therapy, how long someone is on it, their age and their general health and lifestyle. Experts saythat women should weigh all their options and decide, which can only happen if they have choices and information to hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are also medications which may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms, such as antidepressants to treat hot flashes. Many women prefer to take a more natural route, with several herbal supplements claiming to help manage symptoms like hot flashes and sleep disruption. However, these are not generally recommended by health authorities due to a lack of evidence as to their efficacy and safety. Other options include taking vitamin supplements and making lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, losing weight and regular exercise, which may be easier options for women in low-income settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            An analysis of research from the US and five European countries found that most women who had moderate to severe symptoms made lifestyle changes to manage them. The most prescribed treatment was hormone therapy, followed by anti-depressants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the US, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;recent decision&lt;/a&gt; to remove “scary black box warning” labelling on HRT products may see more women choosing the treatment. The country’s Food and Drug Administration decided to remove the “black box” warning stating the increased risks of diseases like breast cancer and dementia, saying the move was “to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” according to the FDA Commissioner Dr Marty Makary.

            “The population is increasing, the lifespan is increasing, and that means women, 50% of the global population, are increasing as well,” says Kurmi. And with women living longer than men, the UN’s World Population Prospects 2024 says there is a need to prioritize “gender-specific health care needs,” and build stronger “social support systems to mitigate potential caregiving burdens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq00293b5zxmzze2x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more women who “are over 40 years, 50 years nowadays,” Kurmi, who is part of a team of researchers looking at the urgent need for attention on menopause, tells CNN there will be an increase in menopause-related health issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq002a3b5znwwhok62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health services in many low and middle-income countries, like India, still focus most of their budget for women  on sexual and reproductive health, due to problems such as high maternal mortality rates, which the Indian government says is a “critical public health issue.” But a growing number of older women are also in need of care, and policies are yet to address their needs. “The government only knows women as a reproductive person, not post-reproductive. She’s not a woman, or she is only defined by her uterus,” says Rajput. What is required is a post-reproductive health policy and scheme, she explains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmien6nuq002b3b5zg2sj6hih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The persistent stigma around menopause also needs addressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The perception around menopause needs to change. And a large part of that comes with awareness,” says Delanarelle of the UK NHS trust. She believes that teaching teenage girls about menopause in school can make a difference because “as they grow up…they understand that menopause is not the end of the line for them. It’s another chapter. You’ve got a book, and menopause is another chapter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The mice were tested for changes in memory and motor function over a 12-week period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior tests on the mice showed that hydrogen sulfide improved cognitive and motor function by 50 percent compared to mice that did not receive the injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice that received the treatment were better able to remember the locations of platform edits and appeared more physically active than the mice that had simulated Alzheimer’s disease but did not receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide, but the researchers wanted to investigate how the brain chemically reacted to the gaseous molecule,” Johns Hopkins Medicine &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease"&gt;wrote in a press release about the study. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-121660"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). When there are healthy levels of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β acts as a signaling molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that in the absence of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β is overattracted to another protein in the brain called Tau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When GSK3β and Tau interact, Tau causes clumps inside nerve cells. As those clumps grow, the tangled proteins block communication between the nerves, eventually causing them to die, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease,” the press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cascade of events is important to designing therapies that can block this interaction like hydrogen sulfide is able to do,” Ph.D student Daniel Giovinazzo, the first author of the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, researchers lacked the tools to mimic how the body makes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The compound used in this study does just that and shows by correcting brain levels of hydrogen sulfide, we could successfully reverse some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease,” collaborator Dr. Matt Whiteman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 04:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNZUMxdmw0bC1kMGdWcnB4N0puU3I5UTNOQ0VuRnczR1hoeWxqTU10SmZieTRaNm1oSWpqWFZDOUhrZVpDTlRxM2pMcENuQ0Jzem9OdzUyRlM4bWQtQ0c2ZnJ6YU5EZzBjS3ZnMnNDR2VrTFZLc0NCNEp2ZjBEemtCTHdaNFdsSFZtVHBEaS1Dc0djY1FlVElMTUVESmVDOUcyemhmMV9ncHI</guid></item><item><title>您的驾驶选择可能隐藏了未来认知能力下降的迹象- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/your-driving-choices-could-be-hiding-signs-of-future-cognitive-decline</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

The team showed how adding data from GPS trackers to standard age and memory tests, along with other demographic factors, enabled the researchers to accurately detect cognitive decline among individuals with preexisting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 87 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dementia-pill-clears-first-major-safety-hurdle-trial-reports"&gt;New Dementia Pill Clears First Major Safety Hurdle, Trial Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early identification of older drivers who are at risk for accidents is a public health priority, but identifying people who are unsafe is challenging and time-consuming," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5298"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurology researcher Ganesh Babulal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that using a GPS data tracking device, we could more accurately determine who had developed cognitive issues than looking at just factors such as age, cognitive test scores, and whether they had a genetic risk factor related to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183968" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184221" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642.jpg" alt="graphs showing mild cognitive impairment and driving" class="wp-image-184221 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/graphs_MCL_driving_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184221" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;B) Longer trips and C) speeding per trip declined as measured over 40 months, comparing cognitively normal (red/dashed) with MCI (blue/solid) (Chen et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data on 56 individuals already diagnosed with MCI (a precursor to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;), comparing them to 242 people of a similar demographic with no cognitive issues. The average age of all participants was 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at driving patterns logged automatically by the volunteers' vehicles across a study period of up to 40 months, together with results from well-established tests, including tasks related to memory, attention, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for factors including age, education, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;genetic risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, the group with MCI showed differences in their driving over time: they drove less often, to fewer places, via simpler routes, while speeding less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the driving data on its own correctly identified individuals with MCI 82 percent of the time.

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, soda drinkers. Neurologist &lt;a href="http://slakhan.gnif.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7986512" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Shaheen Lakhan&lt;/a&gt; says your favorite bubbly beverage is just flat-out bad for your brain. “Soda is one of the worst foods for brain health due to the high concentration of simple sugars, which damage the blood vessels supplying the brain,” he said. “Over time, this starves the brain from the very fuels it needs to function, leading to premature dementia and strokes. Acutely, sugar also causes brain inflammation, irritability, poor mood, and sleep disturbances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the constant highs and lows (the proverbial sugar “rush” and “crash”) can also cause a state of addiction with cravings and withdrawals — and diet soda is no better. “Even diet or zero versions of soda have negative effects, as the calorie-free additives stress out the brain and trick it into consuming more calories and craving real sugar,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margarine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Cough medicines can't treat the underlying virus but they can soothe your throat and reduce the tickly sensations that make you cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If it's a dry cough then choosing balsams or sickly-sweet syrup-based soothing agents like glycerol, can help "coat your throat" and protect against the dryness, says Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But paying more for these isn't worth it with cheaper supermarket-own brands just as effective as the big names, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The one thing to look out for on the label though is sugar content which as you'd expect with sweet syrups is often very high. Sugar-free cough medicines could be a better option if that's a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cough medicines often also advertise that they contain certain "active ingredients". These can include dextromethorphan, which claims to suppress your cough reflex - although Prof Smith says the impact is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dosing is always important she adds, but especially with dextromethorphan which can be addictive. "You certainly wouldn't want to exceed the doses advised on the label," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Levomenthol - an ingredient found in some cough syrups for chesty coughs - meanwhile, offers a "cooling sensation" at the back of the throat, which limits the tickle by masking the sense of irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Drink water and wait it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6e/live/8866ea50-c6bd-11f0-82b1-6148fee2770d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A women coughing heavily into a tissue" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If it's a chesty cough then many find themselves battling what can feel like oceans of phlegm and a tight chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This can come from secondary infections like bronchitis, which inflame the airways, or the extra build-up of phlegm in your nose and sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's natural to turn to an over-the-counter syrup, but Prof Smith's advice is to remain sceptical of their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The ingredient guaifenesin, for instance, is claimed to loosen phlegm, but this lacks conclusive proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And while sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine might help you sleep at night, they don't treat the cough itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There's similarly little evidence that plant extracts, like thyme and squill, have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead, Prof Smith says the best approach is for people to "wait it out", drink water to stay hydrated and take lozenges that encourage swallowing and "inhibit a cough" for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What about honey and lemon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A warm homemade mixture of honey and lemon can have just the same soothing effect for dry coughs as many over-the-counter options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD007094_honey-acute-cough-children" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;A Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt;  – an independent review of evidence - suggested that for children over one year with coughs and colds, the use of honey and lemon could "be of some benefit," adds Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Cough it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's also worth remembering that coughing is necessary. It's how our body gets rid of the mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If it's a mucus-y cough, spitting out the excess can ease the airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I will cough up whatever I need to," says Prof Smith. "I won't try and suppress it, get it out." If you do, make sure you use a tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But should you swallow, no harm is done and the stomach can still break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;You should only worry about the colour of what you're coughing up if it's dark brown as "there may be some blood in it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most chesty coughs generally settle after a few weeks without needing antibiotics, but if it lingers beyond three weeks, Prof Smith urges people to go to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE14REFaUV9hUFFWRkx2TGRDVTZmWVpxRHNoMlVWOG4wbTJjM2RJSW5aOHpkcWFuUTBBcGJWNnRXazYzSkFJZm14ZUhfZ2tLTXpRaHNEV0IyRWlTZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9TRERhNVFwRDh5cVdhRnNfSXhEX3V2bXk1LVdzMndKcmNfY3VMODE3ODNiWGZKeFc0a01XNlI5U2FPcGM3OUw5RklKYXBwMV9IaGhseVYyalVYb016RHNv</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现， 12岁以前的智能手机与抑郁症和睡眠不足有关- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/dc/2025/12/smartphones-before-age-12-tied-to-depression-poor-sleep-new-study-finds/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Experts say waiting to give your kids a smartphone could help protect your child’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Parents often feel pressure to give their kids a smartphone because their classmates already have one. But experts say waiting could help protect your child’s health. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids who get smartphones by age 12 are more likely to struggle with depression, poor sleep and weight issues, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia study&lt;/a&gt; that looked at smartphone use by 10,000 kids between 2018 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that the earlier a child gets a smartphone, the greater the risks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Delaying a smartphone, especially during middle school … may actually reduce the risk of some of these issues,” said Dr. Anisha Abraham, chief of the Division of Adolescent Medicine at Children’s National Hospital in D.C., and an ambassador for the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Center of Excellence on Youth Mental Health and Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham said phones often keep kids up late scrolling and texting, which can hurt school performance and mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleep is really important for well-being. There’s a very strong connection between sleep and being able to feel good. It certainly puts you at higher risk for depression or other mental health issues when you don’t get adequate sleep,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all kids are different, Abraham recommends delaying smartphone use until after middle school, starting slow with phones that don’t have all the apps or creating rules like no phones in bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts also suggest creating clear limits before giving a child a phone. This should include setting guidelines for dinner table use and homework time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also use privacy and content settings on phones to help prevent your child from seeing material they shouldn’t, Abraham said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are parental controls that limit the amount of time that a young person can be on their phone,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular check-ins are also important, and encouraging your kids to spend time away from screens for physical activity can help protect mental health and prevent obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham also urged parents to lead by example by putting their own phones down as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mealtimes are a perfect example to make sure you’re modeling that behavior,” Abraham said. “Parents and caregivers need to be models, and it’s not easy.”&lt;/p&gt;

Because he didn’t have anything to contain the wild animal, he wrapped the raccoon in his coat and “held it against his chest” as he drove for more than an hour to the nature center, which is not licensed to rehabilitate mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point during the drive, officials say the raccoon got somewhat free and bit the man on his face and hands. He then made a pit stop at home, wrapped the animal in a blanket using duct tape, and continued his journey to the center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The man arrived at the CNC an hour before the Wildlife Clinic was set to open, but just as local children were coming for the nature center’s Thanksgiving break camp. The camp director alerted the wildlife staff about what was happening, and the staff met the man in the parking lot to secure the animal in a kennel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After much forceful insistence on our part, he finally agreed to go to the hospital for treatment while we dealt with the raccoon,” the CNC staff wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The raccoon was euthanized and tested at Bells Ferry Veterinary Hospital. Officials say the tests confirmed that the animal had rabies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a further complication, the staff says the man did not give the Wildlife Department or the hospital his full name and instead provided the hospital with a fake phone number. They only learned his real name when a family member called the CNC the next day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While the finder’s heart was in the right place, he put himself, his family, CNC’s staff, volunteers, and visitors, the GWN transporter, and the staff of Bells Ferry all at risk,” the center wrote. “PLEASE take a minute and assess the situation before attempting to capture wildlife without direction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see a wild animal in distress, you can reach out to licensed rehabilitators through Animal Help Now and or the Georgia Wildlife Network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2016/05/yellowstone-tourists-worried-bison-calf-is-cold-so-they-put-it-in-their-car/"&gt;RELATED | Yellowstone tourists put bison calf in car because they’re worried it’s cold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQWDE4ek9senpkYmp6a1otbWpaQ1ByUG03SDNKcE1aV0lSMlJOLTA2Zm5DMUF0X1VSZkdvdFVTdXpieVplbkY5ZjBxc0w2aHIycWdCckNtOTYzdExWODNHU1UtdjVUSDA1TUZYTDRsa2g5cUpNYjVVYVZHTTBFZHgwQm1fSzJaOWthMlR3NHBlelhjSEM5VlVoZzFzMDZFTk15bVFxaC15WU4wUDBvTS00ejQ3OGg3akthNDBmNk1SWnIzMFZvSkprRA</guid></item><item><title>西雅图卫生官员建议海上机场游客在麻疹病例后检查免疫力- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-health-officials-advise-sea-airport-visitors-to-check-immunity-after-measles-case-disease-immunity-vaccine-children-travel-flight-international-safety-symptoms-infectious</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2 class="StoryPage_headline__AP3j8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle health officials advise SEA airport visitors to check immunity after measles case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ByLineContainer_storyBylineContainer__0JNT7" id="js-Story-Byline-0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="ByLine_storyByLineText__cze7l"&gt;by KOMO News Staff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="ByLineContainer_storyDatelineText__yS9e8"&gt;Wed, December 3, 2025 at 5:12 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="ByLineContainer_storyDatelineText__yS9e8"&gt;&lt;span class="ByLineContainer_updatedText__0D6FY"&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;Wed, December 3, 2025 at 9:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="UserWayButton_userWayButton__h8S9a ByLineContainer_userWayButton___vCFL"&gt;&lt;img alt="UserWay icon for accessibility widget" src="/resources/defaults/news_3.0/icons/accessibility/userway-transparent.svg"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 01:15:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAJBVV95cUxQc043aHB3T3VHTGxmRTVnajdyS2tkRm9jX1lOWm9wUVJITVVVaHh0V0ZNV1hiRkRSUFhvV2gzWXpKclRsbmV2WXdaUlNyend2S1BlRUE0UzY1UWZhMW9UMHpEU0RnVmJaeXZ1NEdDUkhRNjNCTG80NzFobVROZ3EzXy0tZWFzYUh5cTF6LXVIeWFnb2tlajRKb0RyUWRKUklrNDBMaERaRG9VSTFLelEwSGpFVDZqRXFVZmliOE1MTUV1bmFuVktjVFNkQXRkSlBlRFRRT1o3ZlUzZnFCazlhOGpMZlZEWFpCalZUZDhyNXZtYVNpd0dwdHBjWGdEbm9LZ3A2YnZuSVI0NDU1UXdkNVJPUFZjQ1R6dlctV1VBbmRyVnVKQ1N4UmdoQnNDWkR2ZzNydw</guid></item><item><title>Germaphobes ，快乐！飞机和医院的空气实际上相当干净，研究声称- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/germaphobes-rejoice-airplane-and-hospital-air-is-actually-pretty-clean-study-claims-2000695101</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to avoid getting sick, chances are you’ll steer clear from visiting a hospital or traveling by plane—environments packed with people and their germs. A new study, however, demonstrates that hospital and airplane air are cleaner than we typically imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed an aircraft air filter, along with face masks worn by travelers and healthcare workers, to investigate the air in airplanes and hospitals. A study published today in the journal Microbiome reveals that the air in both environments primarily hosts harmless microbes usually related to human skin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We realized that we could use face masks as a cheap, easy air-sampling device for personal exposures and general exposures,” Erica Hartmann, lead author of the study and an environmental microbiologist at Northwestern University, said in an emailed university statement. “We extracted DNA from those masks and examined the types of bacteria found there. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the bacteria were the types that we would typically associate with indoor air. Indoor air looks like indoor air, which also looks like human skin.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Used face masks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, Hartmann and her colleagues identified 407 microbial species, such as ordinary skin bacteria and environmental microbes. They also found very few possibly disease-causing microbes without evidence of active infection. Unsurprisingly, the idea for the study dates back to January 2022, at the heart of the covid pandemic. Hartmann received a grant to search for pathogens in airplanes’ cabin filters but realized that investigating high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters might be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“At the time, there was a serious concern about Covid transmission on planes,” explained Hartmann, an expert on indoor microbiomes. Because HEPA filters are very efficient, “we thought it would be a great way to capture everything in the air. But these filters are not like the filters in our cars or homes.” They are very expensive, and “in order to remove them, workers have to pull the airplane out of service for maintenance. This obviously costs an incredible amount of money, and that was eye opening.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;Indoor air looks like indoor air, which also looks like human skin.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was when the team thought of a much cheaper and simpler tool that also captures microbes passively: face masks. As such, the team collected face masks from volunteers who wore them on domestic and international flights. The volunteers also sent face masks that accompanied them on flights but were never worn, for comparison. To investigate the difference between indoor environments, the researchers chose another busy, closed space with heavily filtered air: hospitals. And so they gathered face masks from hospital workers after they’d worn them during a work shift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microbe DNA&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed DNA from the exterior of each mask, finding that the air in both environments contains a diverse but mostly harmless blend of microbes, with little evidence of any that might be pathogenic. The samples from both spaces mostly consisted of common bacteria associated with humans, especially ones in indoor air and from our skin. What’s more, the microbes from both environments were very similar, though the amount of each microbe differed slightly. Ultimately, the similarities indicate that microbes in both airplane and hospital air come from the people themselves—notably, their skin, not their sickness—and not the particular environment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers also found some antibiotic resistance genes associated with major categories of antibiotics. This doesn’t mean there are dangerous microbes floating around, but it does point out the extent to which antibiotic resistance has spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “for this study, we solely looked at what’s in the air,” Hartmann concluded. “Hand hygiene remains an effective way to prevent diseases transmission from surfaces.

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Food and history have always been intertwined. When you're biting into even the simplest piece of bread, a millennium's worth of stories is steeped into each grain. Thanks to archaeological findings, we can connect not only with tales from the past but also with people who walked the Earth before us. Turkey's 5,000-year-old bread takes us back to the Bronze Age, and this long-lost piece of history was made from only three ingredients: Wheat flour crafted from ground emmer, lentils, and a leaf of a plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because of the short ingredient list, you might think this ancient bread is easy to recreate today. Wheat flour is still a common baking ingredient, but true emmer seeds are relict, meaning they're no longer widely available and may be replaced in recipes by other types of farro. Meanwhile, the third plant found in the 5,000-year-old bread remains mysterious, but we do know it was a key ingredient that allowed the dough to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As such, it's impossible to recreate the bread exactly as it was originally made. Still, modern bakers from the Halk Ekmek bakery tried their own spin using Kavilca wheat to substitute for the emmer flour and adding lentils and bulgur, while still trying to deviate from the old recipe as little as possible. The result is a comforting bite with pronounced flavors. It's perhaps the closest we can get to a taste of this 5,000-year-old recipe, offering an experience that not even &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1740624/oldest-restaurants-in-world/" target="_blank"&gt;the oldest restaurants in the world&lt;/a&gt;, nor &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1920891/worlds-oldest-cookbook-history/" target="_blank"&gt;the oldest cookbook with 4,000-year-old recipes&lt;/a&gt;, could beat.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The ancient loaf from 3,300 B.C. wasn't found entirely by chance. Archaeologists have been working on the Küllüoba Mound site since 1996, and many prehistoric finds have since been unearthed, including deposits from the Late Chalcolithic period and remains from the Hellenistic period. But in 2024, archaeologists from the Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University were excavating the Küllüoba Mound site when they discovered the 5,000-year-old loaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The bread came from an individual — presumed to be an ancient Hattian — who perhaps made a bad batch and decided to dispose of it by burying it outside their home. However, it's more likely that it reflects an ancient ritual to bring abundance. Regardless of what compelled this baker's actions, burying the significantly burnt bread was how the loaf survived in bigger chunks than usual. And if you want to see this enduring loaf in person, you can find it at Turkey's Eskişehir Archaeological Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Considered one of the most ancient loaves ever excavated, it's still quite young compared to the 8,600-year-old bread found at another archaeological site in Turkey. Experts were able to determine wheat, barley, and pea seeds among the ingredients that brought the older bread to life. Using food not only as sustenance but also as a pleasant treat, a fixture in celebrations, and a cloak of comfort shows the greatness of human invention. Civilization itself is imbued with &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1949893/historic-culinary-practices-with-unesco-status/" target="_blank"&gt;historical culinary practices — some of which have UNESCO status&lt;/a&gt; — documenting how the beauty of food knows no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

That huge number helps explain why interest in gut-friendly bacteria, found in probiotics and fermented foods, has exploded in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now asking when probiotics, live microbes that can benefit health, truly help people and when they end up doing very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies from teams in the United States, Europe, and Asia test whether particular probiotic strains influence digestion, mood, immunity, and heart risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-probiotics-and-human-health"&gt;Probiotics and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One researcher at the center of this work is Chong Su Kim, PhD, at Seoul National University in South Korea (&lt;a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNU&lt;/a&gt;). Kim’s research focuses on how gut-friendly bacteria influence thinking skills and stress levels in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international science group &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;defines&lt;/a&gt; probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organisms are added to yogurt, kefir, and other foods or packed into capsules that survive the trip through your digestive tract. Your intestinal wall is lined with a microbiome, a community of microbes living on and in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that community is diverse and balanced, it helps &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tortillas-can-last-a-month-without-refrigeration/"&gt;digest food&lt;/a&gt;, trains the immune system, and keeps harmful microbes in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because different species behave differently, a probiotic that eases diarrhea in one trial might not help constipation or bloating in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who study clinical data stress that probiotic effects are strain specific and condition specific, so recommendations need to be much more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-health-and-probiotics"&gt;Gut health and probiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many trials look at short term problems like antibiotic related diarrhea, constipation, or flares of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these studies show that certain probiotic strains can modestly lower the chance of these issues or shorten how long they last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, a long lasting gut disorder with pain and bowel changes, the picture is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews find modest gains in pain and bloating for some products, yet one gastroenterology group considers the evidence too weak for routine use. Evidence is sometimes strongest in very specific situations rather than everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one four week &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, marathon runners taking a multi strain probiotic had fewer gut symptoms during the race than those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, other trials see no meaningful change in similar symptoms, even when they use high doses or combinations of strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday digestive complaints, probiotics are best seen as one experiment among many, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/"&gt;diet changes&lt;/a&gt;, rather than an automatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-between-gut-and-brain"&gt;Signals between gut and brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often frame this connection as the gut brain axis, the two way flow of signals between intestinal microbes and the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in gut bacteria can affect stress hormones, immune signals, and even the chemicals that nerve cells use to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one 12-week &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/76/1/32/5821144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults over 65 took a capsule containing two Bifidobacterium strains or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who received the probiotic showed higher levels of a brain growth factor that helps support learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing up the findings, the authors wrote that “probiotics promote mental flexibility and alleviate stress in older adults” in their report on this trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim and colleagues emphasized that the work involved relatively healthy people and does not replace standard care for depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-immunity-and-infections"&gt;Heart, immunity, and infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond gut and brain health, probiotics have been tested for their effects on cholesterol, blood sugar, and low grade inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; combining human trials reported that vitamin D plus probiotics slightly improved heart blood markers compared with vitamin D alone or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those changes are much smaller than the effects of cholesterol medicines, yet they hint that some people might gain a small extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart trials using probiotics alone have shown mixed results, with some lowering bad cholesterol slightly and others showing no real difference from placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics have also been tested for upper respiratory tract infections, infections of the nose, throat, and sinuses that cause most common colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9400717/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from a group of trials found that people taking probiotics were less likely to experience at least one of these infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodes also tended to be shorter, though the strength of this finding varied depending on the type of probiotic and the group studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results hint at an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-probiotic-could-make-it-safer-to-eat-seafood/"&gt;immune benefit&lt;/a&gt;, but they do not turn probiotics into substitutes for vaccines or simple habits like handwashing and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-probiotics-on-your-plate"&gt;Probiotics on your plate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before capsules existed, people took in helpful microbes through fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/video/kombucha-brewing-improved-by-scientists/"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods bring flavor and texture along with bacteria and yeasts that can support a more varied gut community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every fermented product sold in stores still contains live cultures, because pasteurizing and other processing steps can kill the microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking labels for phrases like live and active cultures and storing products in fridge raises odds that organisms survive until you eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health also depends on what surrounds those fermented foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds that feed your existing microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians encourage people to focus on a varied eating pattern rich in fiber and plant foods before turning to pills for everyday digestive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-a-supplement-wisely"&gt;Choosing a supplement wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering a probiotic supplement, especially children, pregnant people, or those with weak immunity, should first discuss it with a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are critically ill or who have central lines have, in rare cases, developed serious infections from probiotic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most supplement labels list the dose in colony forming units, a count of live microbes expected in a serving by the end of shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many products provide about 1 to 10 billion units a day, but the useful amount varies with the strain and the health goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the safest approach is to match a probiotic to a goal, such as testing whether it eases one clearly defined symptom, and to keep expectations modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking with health professionals and focusing on food sources first helps people use &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/probiotics-help-overweight-dogs-shed-pounds/"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;

Social media users have dubbed it “scromiting,” a combination of screaming and vomiting, though doctors refer to it as Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome, or CHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency rooms are seeing more chronic marijuana users—often teenagers—arrive with symptoms that include severe stomach pain, nausea and vomiting that can last for hours. Physicians say many of the same patients return repeatedly and often undergo extensive testing to rule out other, more serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have not determined what triggers CHS in some users but not others, and there is no clear guidance on how much or how often cannabis must be used for symptoms to appear. Some physicians believe rising THC levels in today’s cannabis products—now up to four times higher than decades ago—may be contributing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition remains under study as cases continue to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 22:03:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wJBVV95cUxQUjJxcHFmeDNuUGFuamtKSWU3eDV6bWFlMXNZN0R3WGUtcE9DLW9CXy1tTk1UVkZwVUVrNHBmRjZoUF9pTE5LN1VyUTRmWEpUSTJOM3Y1UFQtZDBST3FFTUVZRTdOUFU1OTlfMmtaQkowY2x1OUxGT0R0c25PZHc4cURBUUlQczVUZ0J0c1llbXN1RThBamh2NlJWdVNSazV1b1RDSmJQbHctQjhBaDBxQXEwTzdka3U1LWRzM3NEWFRXOHoyNWZGNmhScDc2QjgxYldhdzdkSkhSVzBReGVCUXdFMVgwSWlJWEtjdWhlYnlkRU1LWUVVOXNlYU1DTkVJUFdYMC14X1dodGh3aGxoa2x1Qk8wNDU0WkNhaGNrMnZQbnZ2Sm91RS1hQ1ZYQjB4blBlaENyZWJMV3Z5ZUpPcEhWZHNjWldob093NnM5Sm9adWs</guid></item><item><title>美国是否使用了太多的精神药物？ -华尔街日报。-华尔街日报播客-华尔街日报</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/is-america-on-too-many-psychiatric-drugs/53eae650-b297-4ec8-a2e2-c50168f597c8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 20:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQbFNmd29YWGNzTHlHUWdVdXk5NlhyblpsNzFDTkI4UWJVNVV5akhPajJBSWNfU05tOUhINVRibFpQUkc3NDItVlNWSzE1NmVkdXBUNGdnUm52MVFIeXU0ZE1mZDZMbGQzMnJFNWIwejhrWlIwQ1ZWT3pLSG92cTVndFRFUHhtRlkySUJfSWU1Vms2VnJ6RnpTSHFtZHlfc0N2OGJuYk5XbzlTOGdhR0VtdjdldndfMEJYNFE</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的疫苗顾问开会质疑长期使用的疫苗- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5630917/cdc-childhood-vaccine-schedule</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Powerful federal advisers this week are expected to make a controversial change to how babies are immunized against hepatitis B, and to question how pediatricians inoculate children against more than a dozen other infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, whooping cough and polio.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ACIP) is convening Thursday and Friday for a closely watched meeting to rethink fundamental elements of the childhood vaccination schedule, which has protected children from dangerous diseases for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The potential changes are welcomed by allies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We're now starting to see truth telling about vaccines, and needless to say, pharma, medicine, academia, mainstream media are not happy," Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense said &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1996203075367743521" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted to the group's social media page. The nonprofit advocates against vaccines and was co-founded by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting underscores grave concerns among many public health experts, who fear it will further erode childhood vaccinations, leading to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We now seem to have entered a dangerous new phase in Secretary Kennedy's campaign to shut down scientific expertise, silence the best available evidence, and replace it with his own personal agenda," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8599" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Anschutz who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics's committee on infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee, established in 1964, had long been considered a definitive source of information about childhood vaccines. It wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the pediatrics academy and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The committee's September meeting devolved into chaos. A scheduled vote on the hepatitis B vaccine was tabled amid confusion. The chairman was&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/renowned-epidemiologist-and-biostatistician-martin-kulldorff-appointed-to-senior-hhs-role.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. The new chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, is a pediatric cardiologist and fellow with the Independent Medical Alliance – a group which continues to recommend treating COVID with drugs like ivermectin, even though studies have shown it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Confidence in the CDC was further eroded last month when the agency &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changed its stance on whether vaccines may cause autism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a theory championed by Kennedy and other anti-vaccine activists but long debunked by a large body of high-quality research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response, many independent medical groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1uu9d3q*_ga*NTIyNjU3NDI2LjE3NTk0MzYyNjM.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkbzUkZzAkdDE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/immunization-schedules/birth-through-age-18-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a newly formed effort at the University of Minnesota called the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Projec&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;t, have begun issuing independent recommendations, which some states have begun following instead.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccine schedule under the microscope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is expected to hear the first report by a new working group tasked with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine preventable diseases, which are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have seen more measles cases in our country this year than we have in recent history. In my own community, we're seeing quite significant upticks in pertussis," said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department, based in Charlotte, N.C., "Any barriers [to vaccination] that might be created by bureaucracy or process pose a threat to the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine proponents say every vaccine is carefully evaluated for safety and effectiveness before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators monitor all vaccines for safety issues after doctors start using them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Children receive the roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don't catch dangerous diseases when they're most vulnerable, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every vaccine on that schedule and the recommended timing of it exists for a reason," says pediatrician O'Leary. "It's based on the age at which a child's immune system can provide optimal protection after vaccination, balanced with the age when the child is at highest risk for a disease. There's no reason to delay or space out vaccines – doing so just puts children at risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child's immune system. But supporters say children are exposed to far more immune stimulation from naturally occurring microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine saying we can only use medicines now that were developed before 1990," O'Leary says. "Imagine where we would be in medicine today. These newer vaccines are a good thing. They save lives. That's why we give them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A change for the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first concrete step expected from the committee is a vote to change the current recommendation that all babies get vaccinated against hepatitis B within the first 24 hours of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the committee might recommend, but it could include delaying the shot or requiring a detailed discussion with parents before administering the shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Proponents of the change argue universal vaccination at birth is unnecessary because hepatitis B is often spread through sexual contact and drug use. Babies could be protected by increased screening of pregnant women and only inoculating babies of mothers who test positive, some argue. Supporters of the change also point to other countries that don't give newborns the dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But hepatitis B spreads other ways. The virus is highly infectious, and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood. People can also get infected by coming into contact with common household objects, such as toothbrushes, and towels, that have been contaminated by another family member.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A new analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by researchers who have presented at past ACIP meetings finds that delaying hepatitis B vaccination by just a few months could lead to more than $222 million in excess healthcare costs and hundreds of preventable deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most babies infected with the virus end up with chronic infections, which increases their risk for liver disease, failure and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Universal vaccination has been the cornerstone of hepatitis B elimination efforts for decades," says Eric Hall, assistant professor of epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University, and a co-author on the analysis. "It's very important we continue this work and do not undo the important public health achievements of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;past 45 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Inoculating all babies at birth has resulted in a dramatic decrease in hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The hepatitis B vaccine has one of the most well-established safety records of any vaccine, and it's one of our best," O'Leary says. "We've been using it for a long time. It's one of our best tools to protect babies from chronic illness and liver cancer. This is a situation where one missed case is too many."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that pediatricians partner with parents on children's health. "You probably will also hear a lot from individuals in this meeting who claim parents don't get a say in their children's immunizations," he said. "I want to be very clear when I say that's completely false. … We want to make sure we're protecting children from harmful diseases while also making sure the parents are fully informed and involved in the process."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, proponents of universal hepatitis B vaccination at birth argue there is no evidence the current approach is unsafe. And delaying the first dose would cause major problems because the subsequent two doses are administered as part of combination vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts are also alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Aluminum ingredients under fire&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee is also studying the safety of an ingredient commonly used in vaccines, an additive that contains aluminum. Coming after other recent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/06/nx-s1-5454890/vaccine-ingredient-thimerosal-cdc-acip" target="_blank"&gt;changes to vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;, many public health experts worry that the administration may now try to remove the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For almost a century, some important vaccines, including shots that protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis and the flu, have included aluminum salts, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/adjuvants.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;compounds that contain small amounts of aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They are used as adjuvants to give the immune system an extra boost to make the shots protective.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What aluminum does is it draws the immune system's attention to that particular little protein so that it makes a much more robust immune response that you then are protected by," O'Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One question the working group is considering is "do either of the two different aluminum adjuvants increase the risk of asthma?" according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/child-schedule-tor-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; outlining the group's mandate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most public health experts say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40658954/" target="_blank"&gt;large Danish study &lt;/a&gt;recently debunked any danger. People are exposed to &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/phs/phs.aspx?phsid=1076&amp;amp;toxid=34" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis from food, consumer products and their surrounding environment than from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to concerns over asthma, critics claim aluminum can&lt;a href="https://www.aluminiumresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt; also increase the risk for other health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Based on large, long-term studies and immunology research, there is no evidence that vaccines cause either allergies or autoimmune disorders e.g., Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus," Dr. Frank Virant, president of the Board of Directors at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;amp; Immunology, wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But removing aluminum from vaccines would render them ineffective, and there are no substitute vaccines ready to go. It could take years to develop reformulated replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

Certain psychological conditions are associated with enhanced creativity, social sensitivity, emotional awareness, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term studies reveal that some individuals not only recover, but go on to achieve higher-than-average well-being. Recognizing these “silver linings” could help reshape treatment, reduce stigma, and offer patients a more hopeful, balanced path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Mild schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum conditions, and hypomania are linked to higher creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression and mood disorders are associated with increased empathy, cooperation, and social awareness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thriving After Illness:&lt;/strong&gt; A portion of people diagnosed with depression later achieve above-average psychological well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An estimated one in five U.S. adults live with mental illnesses, conditions that are almost universally characterized by their negative consequences. But there are also positive attributes associated with psychological disorders— and acknowledging them can reduce stigma, improve care and provide hope to patients and their families.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the case made in a new paper titled Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows people standing in a spotlight." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/mental-health-strength-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“Some of the most creative minds in our society have also been the minds of people who had mental illness,” said Gruber. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In it, University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor June Gruber and co-authors at Cornell University point to dozens of studies dating back decades, which associate mental illness with heightened creativity, empathy, resilience and other positive qualities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prevailing narrative in clinical psychology focuses on mental health from a disease model perspective—we are taught to diagnose what’s wrong and try to fix it,” said Gruber, director of the Positive Emotion and Psychopathology Lab at CU Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leaves out the fact that at the same time people struggle with mental health challenges, they may also grow, thrive and even develop unique strengths.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in Current Directions in Psychological Science, the paper highlights evidence showing that people with mild schizophrenia, hypomania and bipolar disorder tend to score higher on measures of creativity and gravitate toward more creative professions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the most creative minds in our society have also been the minds of people who had mental illness,” said Gruber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of depression also tend to show more willingness to cooperate, research from Gruber’s lab and others has shown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CU Boulder study of nearly 2,000 college students found that although those on the bipolar spectrum report greater social conflict, they also report significantly larger social networks and feel greater social support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study from Gruber’s lab found that while young adults at increased risk for mania tend to perceive even negative situations in an overly positive light, they are also better at detecting emotional shifts in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, our findings show that along with well-documented social challenges that come with mood disorders, there may also be meaningful social strengths,” said Gruber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the silver linings paper, the authors note that many people in remission from mental illness look back on their darkest struggles as catalysts that helped them build resilience and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take one 2019 study, led by Cornell Psychology Professor Jonathan Rottenberg, a co-author on the ‘silver linings’ paper. It found that 10 years after being diagnosed with clinical depression, 10% of study participants were “thriving” (meaning they were not only free of depression but had a psychological well-being better than one-quarter of nondepressed adults). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruber and Rottenberg said they do not intend to convey a “Pollyanna,” or “all-will-be-well” approach that glosses over the real suffering that comes with mental illness. But they do want to provide hope, rooted in data, that positive outcomes can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stress that the paper is not a call to abandon medication or psychotherapy, which can be lifesaving. Rather, it is a call for a more holistic approach to research and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging silver linings, Gruber believes her field can reduce stigma and potentially develop treatment plans that seek to preserve the unique traits people like about themselves while keeping the harmful elements of their illness at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a more holistic understanding of a person, you can do more to support them,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790674258"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can mental illness be linked to positive traits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Research shows some psychological conditions are associated with strengths like creativity, empathy, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790675864"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does this mean mental illness is not serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: No. The findings do not minimize suffering but highlight that positive traits can coexist with serious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764790675601"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Are people able to fully recover and thrive after mental illness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Long-term data show a portion of individuals achieve both remission and above-average psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14787d67753a797566677c75787854777b787b6675707b3a717061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Marshall – University of Colorado&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09637214251360738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change&lt;/a&gt;” by June Gruber et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Linings in Psychological Disorders: An Agenda for Research and Social Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional research on people with psychological disorders is negatively focused, concentrating on what is aberrant and harmful about psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet we argue that the conventional approach to psychopathology is factually incomplete and may also inadvertently perpetuate the deeply entrenched stigma surrounding mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology—silver linings—and integrating them into psychopathology research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our research agenda for studying silver linings in psychopathology (SLIP), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation.

The country of Wales unintentionally produced one of those moments when a routine shingles vaccine – given only to people hitting a very narrow age window – appeared to protect long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unexpected pattern caught the attention of &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; researchers, who combed through years of medical records and found something striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study deepened the story, pointing toward viral reactivation, immune aging, and neuroinflammation as powerful – and often overlooked – forces in cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that a simple shingles shot may do far more for the aging brain than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-dormant-viruses-awaken"&gt;When dormant viruses awaken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varicella-zoster remains silent in nerve cells after childhood infection. Reactivation risk rises with age. Dementia research once focused on plaques and tangles alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work highlights neuroinflammation as a major driver. Neurotropic herpesviruses can seed amyloid in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human organoid work links viral activity with tau changes. Chronic viral stress may push immune pathways into harmful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/where-you-live-may-affect-your-dementia-risk/"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Reactivation pulses may degrade cognitive reserve over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wales introduced a live shingles vaccine with strict age rules. Only individuals aged exactly 79 in early autumn gained access for one year. Individuals just older lost access permanently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This narrow gap created two nearly identical groups. Corresponding author Pascal Geldsetzer explained a key concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these associational studies suffer from the basic problem that people who go get vaccinated have different health &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-is-a-growing-global-health-crisis-with-a-staggering-cost/"&gt;behaviors&lt;/a&gt; than those who don’t,” he said. The Welsh plan solved that concern through pure timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-and-the-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Dementia and the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford Medicine tracked outcomes across seven years. Vaccinated individuals showed a 20 percent lower rate of dementia. A &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper expanded that pattern. Mild cognitive impairment fell in the vaccinated group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia-related deaths also dropped across nearly a decade. Evidence pointed to protection across the full disease path. Regression methods reduced confounding risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other intervention aligned with the exact birthdate rule. Consistent outcomes supported a causal interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment signals early trouble in memory networks. The &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; study followed over 200,000 new cases. Vaccine eligibility lowered new diagnoses over a nine-year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual vaccine receipt lowered risk even more. Analyses held firm across many statistical checks. The age difference was only a few days, yet protection remained clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral mechanisms likely shaped this early stage through reduced reactivation events. Reduced immune stress may preserve neural circuits in vulnerable regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccine-slowed-dementia"&gt;Vaccine slowed dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second group included individuals already living with dementia. Nearly half died from dementia causes over nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals showed far fewer dementia-related deaths. Actual vaccine receipt dropped that risk by nearly one-third. Evidence again pointed to broad &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most exciting part is that the shingles vaccine doesn’t have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,” Geldsetzer said. Survival gains hinted at reduced inflammatory pressure in advanced disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women gained stronger protection in both early and late stages. Women often mount higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-after-vaccination-improves-antibody-levels/"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; responses after live vaccines. Varicella-zoster reactivation also appears more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors may amplify vaccine impact on immune tone. Cognitive decline risk falls as immune stability rises. Women showed reductions in mild cognitive impairment and dementia-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men did not show clear shifts in either stage. Sex-linked immune biology may hold crucial clues for future work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-dementia-with-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Preventing dementia with shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work explores immune pathways independent of viral action. Some vaccines boost innate pathways in older age. Such boosts may counter immunosenescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live vaccines often produce broad health gains unrelated to direct targets. Some work links vaccination with stronger long term immune balance. Reduced chronic inflammation may protect neural circuits across many decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New theory suggests cumulative viral reactivations erode &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; resilience. Shingles vaccination may interrupt harmful cycles early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar age-based rollouts in Australia and several other countries now show matching results. Records from England, New Zealand, and Canada echo the Welsh pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains appear stable across cultures, health systems, and demographics. “We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,” Geldsetzer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such uniformity strengthens confidence in causal action. International teams now explore additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-lessons-from-shingles"&gt;Dementia lessons from shingles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized trial could confirm these findings with full certainty. Geldsetzer called it simple. “It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,” he said. Wales showed curve separation within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial may reveal early signals without long waits. Newer shingles vaccines may offer even stronger impact. Philanthropic support now aims to launch such work soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work suggests a single shot may slow decline across many stages of dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/public-health-and-environmental-justice-the-push-for-electric-trucks-in-cities/"&gt;Public health&lt;/a&gt; systems rarely create natural experiments of such clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation of Wales offered one such moment. Research now points toward practical potential for brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 19:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVGxtZzVyOHRVaExtUzBzY2pXNEc2X3FRdlJ5dlpuVGR2MzZPVkNGU1BJMUY1UnBhb3BLVk4zYnlkbkVQOVJlQVJBMHo4OWpVVG50em91cFBwbTF5elJZRy1NOGhYZE1Yd0JHU2ZhQnQyNXFGRTBqdl82dThveG8wOUJocE5DcXphdjBJQ1JLVFdvbWdzYjAw</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬看到他的晚餐部分并立即选择暴力-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-sees-dinner-portion-184000000.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are few ad campaigns more iconic than Snickers' "You're not yourself when you're hungry." And honestly, it worked because they were onto something. I can be many things in this life, but hungry is not the version of me anyone wants to meet. I've canceled first meetings out of fear of being hangry and unhinged. My therapist would call that self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And as it turns out, dogs aren't above that struggle either. Especially not golden retrievers, who may be angelic 90 percent of the time but turn into full-on dramatic divas the moment dinner is late—or, in this case, when dinner feels like a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐶&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pups get loud, some get pouty, but the golden retriever in this viral TikTok clip takes one look at his dinner portion and decides to enter his villain era. The moment his dad pours just a sprinkle of kibble into the bowl, everything inside this dog snaps like a glowstick at a middle-school dance. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most relatable funny dog videos of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before we dive in, this isn't the first time a pet has delivered a meltdown worthy of an Oscar. Just recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/tiktok-t-stop-laughing-goldendoodle-144000340.html" data-ylk="slk:goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum&lt;/a&gt; had TikTok in tears from laughing, and this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/very-tiny-very-angry-bunny-172000057.html" data-ylk="slk:tiny angry bunny losing his mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;tiny angry bunny losing his mind&lt;/a&gt; proved that even small pets can unleash big drama. Whether it is hunger rage, toy rage, or bunny rage, we are witnessing the full spectrum of unhinged animal behavior, and I must admit I am a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever's Dinner Bowl Meltdown Is Sending TikTok Into Chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The golden retriever in the video starts hopeful, tail wagging, eyes bright, fully believing in the goodness of the world. Then Dad empties a few lonely pieces of kibble into his bowl and sweetly says, "Here you go, big guy." And that's when tragedy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The dog freezes. The ominous music swells. One eyebrow goes up like he's questioning the entire foundation of their relationship. Then comes "the look." The universal dog expression that says, "BFFR."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/popcorn-explosion-tiktok-says-dog-014000429.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the very next moment, chaos erupts. The video jumps from mild concern to "choose your fighter" energy as the golden retriever launches himself at his dad in full WWE mode. It's the kind of hangry dog behavior every pet parent recognizes: one second they're sweet, the next they're a chaotic gremlin fueled solely by betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;TikTok felt that energy instantly. One viewer joked, "So you have chosen… DEATH," while another added, "Oh, we still playing games?" Someone else even clocked that his tail, the golden retriever's emotional barometer, stopped wagging slowly, signaling that Dad had officially crossed the line with that tiny food portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But even with all the drama, the clip is still peak golden retriever: 90 percent angel, 10 percent playful gremlin, and 100 percent hilarious. If you've ever been even one minute late to dinner time, you already know this story. Dogs take food very seriously and, apparently, portion sizes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/dachshund-micromanaging-dad-tiktok-wheezing-194000916.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Dachshund Micromanaging His Dad Has TikTok Wheezing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: This Dachshund Micromanaging His Dad Has TikTok Wheezing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-dinner-portion-violence-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 3, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

These included NAMPT, IL6, IL1B and NLRP3, which usually switch on when the body is under stress.

The cases of cancer, particularly in the colon and rectum have been increasing annually at levels that are alarming to the general public. According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the US. In the year 2025, about 107,320 new cases of colon cancer were expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An urgent concern here is the rising cases of colon cancer among young adults. As per the ACS, it is more common after the age of 50, however, people younger than this age are being diagnosed with the cancer and the reason for the same "remains unclear." In this case, the best thing to do is to watch out for any early signs and symptoms that can help with the timely diagnosis of the disease and thus make getting the treatment easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Hidden Signs of Colon Cancer You Could Be Ignoring That Might Save Your Life | Dr Deep Goel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gastroenterologist warns about colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video going viral on Instagram, Dr Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist with a following of 1.6M on the social media app shared four signs of colon cancer in the 30s. These signs are easy to observe and signal immediate medical attention for proper treatment. What are these? Find out below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="27218518" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="unexplained-fatigue" source="keywords"&gt;Unexplained fatigue&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worsening fatigue causing you to sleep more is because colon cancers can bleed over time causing iron deficiency anaemia and a low blood level can cause worsening fatigue," said the doctor in the video. A 2014 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journal.waocp.org/article_29038_6c840fce46022e4da6236292e81567bf.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, anaemia is the most important cause of fatigue in cancer and its treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweating at night&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the doc, night sweats are caused when the cancers release inflammatory proteins that can result in inappropriate fevers and night sweats.

You could be experiencing more constipation or diarrhoea than normal. This is due to the blockage of the stool from the cancer, explained the doc. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/are-your-symptoms-inflammatory-bowel-syndrome-ibs-or-colorectal-cancer.h00-159458478.html#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20symptoms%20of%20colorectal%20cancer?,Change%20in%20appetite" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain are all symptoms of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="24410501" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-in-stool" source="keywords"&gt;Blood in stool&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor called this the "hallmark of colon cancer". As per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/colon-cancer/colon-cancer-symptoms#:~:text=Bright%20red%20blood%20in%20the,Tell%20You%20About%20Your%20Health" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, blood in the stool typically indicates there is bleeding in the colon or rectum and can be a sign of cancer. While the sign also coincides with haemorrhoids, when it is more consistent, it is likely a sign of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sharp rise in cases of colon cancer in the youth, it is vital to watch out for signs that can help you recognise the underlying health condition in time for diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Because, honestly, I don’t think “Hey, let’s not subject Caiden (or the overworked mall Santa) to another traumatic incident this year!” should be that difficult of a request. Let me ask you—are your in-laws psychotic Santa freaks, too? Are they going to cut off Caiden’s trust fund if he can’t keep his shit together while sitting on that strange man’s lap?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq87z2c000m3b78dt9hpdyp@published"&gt;Whatever version of this is true, your instinct is correct to tell Bridget that you have a few more years to get this photo right and that it’s borderline abusive if she keeps trotting him out there when he’s clearly not ready. If Bridget laughs you off dismissively, there is only one thing left to do: Fill her entire underwear drawer with coal.&lt;/p&gt;

Just gently remind her that you love her and you simply want to give Caiden one less thing to cry about during the happiest time of the year. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7x50e00i8symcw2xlevs8@published"&gt;I am a divorced dad of three, a boy (12) and two girls (11, 8). I had a psychiatric emergency around the time of the divorce (I’m fine now). But as a result, my ex-wife has full custody, and I get the kids for four hours every weekend at my home. My question is about the anxiety I feel around the time with the kids, which is centered on the idea that I have to maximize every second to be a good dad given these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a5000x3b785i1v3lun@published"&gt;Sometimes we watch cartoons, sometimes we play board games, we talk about random stuff and what’s going on at school. But other times I have a football game on and they play by themselves. None of them care about watching sports, but sometimes they hang around and watch a little, though usually they get into their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a5000y3b78x31ys77o@published"&gt;I also don’t feel I have the imagination to be 100 percent  or even 50 percent in when they play imaginatively, especially the youngest, who makes up fun stuff all the time that I barely know how to participate in.  I often don’t have the energy to play running-around type games.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a5000z3b78o0ovnbcv@published"&gt;All of this would be fine I think if it was part of more full-time parenting.  I’m fairly sure they get plenty of non-direct parenting when they are home with their mom, and they are comfortable on their own. But she gets days and nights with them and car trips and mall trips and family vacations, etc.  Because I only get these four hours I feel like I am supposed to be an all-out Dad for every minute of it, for them and for me.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand the anxiety and insecurity, but there is no way to ever be in “all-out” dad mode for four hours with three kids, so relieve yourself of that pressure.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a600143b782aksu54r@published"&gt;It helps that your children are old enough to keep themselves occupied, so you shouldn’t feel pressure to turn your dining area into a&lt;a href="https://thetechinfluencer.com/how-to-set-up-a-vr-room/"&gt; VR room&lt;/a&gt; or your bathroom into a mini-water park to give all of you a shared fun activity that will make your kids love you more than their future stepfather. Don’t catastrophize this!  I’m sure that thousands of “World’s Best Dad” coffee mugs have been gifted to fathers much lousier than you.&lt;/p&gt;

But–this is crucial–try not to obsess over having the perfect moment or being the perfect dad for that moment, and go easy on yourself and them. They’re glad you’re still in their lives, and I’m sure your ex-wife is, too. So when they’re in your care, read the room: The best way to show love and provide safety could be to let everyone feel like they can decompress however they need to, and that includes you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7x50e00iesymc33cvo6ic@published"&gt;I am so sad. My youngest daughter, E (29), is very much estranged from me but requires me to see her a few times during the year. This causes me much distress, but I want to remain present when she wants me to be there. The issue I am having is that she always throws me an offhand comment that has double meanings during these times. Her words hurt me very much. Up until yesterday, I have mostly not acknowledged them. But she stated, “I basically raised myself from 13 on.” I have recently realized that I had made some bad and uncharacteristic decisions from her thirteenth year up to about six months ago. I have had some great revelations in therapy and feel very grounded and future-focused. She’s in therapy too, and I know I am the reason for that. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/11/therapy-revelations-forgiveness-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;But she does not want to forgive me.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
