Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-032d50c0-9acd-11f0-9097-57eac862fc79"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A severe outbreak of the virus in China totaling more than 10,000 cases prompted the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15061875/cdc-travel-advisory-chikungunya-virus-china-usa.html"&gt;CDC to issue a level 2 travel warning&lt;/a&gt; for the Guangdong Province, the epicenter, in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The spread of the mosquito-borne disease triggered a roll out of Covid-like restrictions in China, with patients quarantined in hospitals and electricity cut off to residents who did not follow government health protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is a 'nationally notifiable' condition in the US, meaning health authorities can voluntarily report cases to the agency for national tracking and monitoring. While a handful of cases pop up in the US every year from people traveling to high-risk areas, America hasn't experienced local transmission since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A worker sprays insecticide at a public housing estate following reports of imported cases of Chikungunya virus in Hong Kong, China, in August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus has been detected in a woman who lives on Long Island, New York, home to 8 million people and the celebrity-loved Hamptons (file photo above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But with more than 4.7 million US passengers flying internationally on any given day, mosquitoes in America could bite an infected traveler and begin transmitting the virus locally to Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A New York Health Department of Health spokesperson &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntd.com/first-possible-local-chikungunya-case-reported-in-new-york-state-history_1092862.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;NTD News: 'The New York State Department of Health is investigating a possible locally acquired case of chikungunya virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No locally acquired cases have ever been reported in New York State, and the risk to the public remains very low.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The department is working with local Long Island health authorities to confirm the patient's test results. Local mosquito surveillance has not detected chikungunya virus in local insect populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chikungunya virus is spread primarily by the Aedes mosquito species and nearly half a million people became infected between 2004 and 2005, leading to a worldwide epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diana Rojas Alvarez, a medical officer at the World Health Organization said this summer of the new cases: 'We are seeing history repeating itself,' referencing the 2004-2005 epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya infections are most common in Asia, Africa and South America, though more recently cases have also emerged across Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus can cause symptoms like fever, joint pain and life-threatening complications related to the heart and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A worker sprays against mosquitoes at night in a park in France to combat the spread of chikungunya virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the 12-month chikungunya virus case notification rate per 100,000 people from September 2024 to August 2025 (source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15 to 35 percent of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incubation period is typically three to seven days, and the most common symptom is a sudden onset of a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are rare, but can occur in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection does not spread from person to person through bodily contact or saliva and can only be transmitted through a bite from an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since there is no specific medical treatment for the chikungunya infections, though certain therapies are used to manage symptoms and any lasting complications, experts ask people to regularly use insect repellents and wear long-sleeve clothing to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two vaccines available for chikungunya virus, but they are not routine and only recommended for people visiting areas with an outbreak or that may pose a higher risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, kids in America are safer than ever. But apparently, golf carts didn’t get the memo. New research this week finds that pediatric golf cart injuries are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia conducted the study, which analyzed golf cart injuries that sent children and young adults to the emergency room. They found that these injuries had increased in recent years, with almost half involving children under the age of 12. More needs to be done to beat back the golf cart menace, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The growing trend of golf cart use in residential areas, alongside the increased frequency of children driving and riding these vehicles, correlates with a concerning rise in both the number and variety of childhood golf cart injuries,” said study author Theodore Ganley, director of the Sports Medicine and Performance Center at CHOP, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098920?"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The findings are being presented over the weekend at AAP’s national conference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why and how kids are getting hurt by golf carts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers pored through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a database of injuries treated at hospital emergency departments across the country. The data is intended to be nationally representative, so scientists often use it to gauge how many Americans are hurt by specific products or specific causes of injury.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They examined NEISS data between 2010 and 2023, focusing on golf cart-related injuries among children and young adults (aged 22 and younger). They counted 1,419 cases during that period—amounting to an estimated 53,855 such injuries nationwide during that period. On average, they estimated that around 3,800 golf cart injuries occurred annually, but they also found that these injuries had increased consistently during the past three years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average age of a golf cart victim was 11, and 90% of those hurt were boys. Roughly half of the injuries were caused by someone falling from the cart, while 36% involved a collision or cart overturning. Kids were most often hurt along the head, face, or neck, while half of all injuries were deemed superficial.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Notably, other research has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18541177/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the trend of rising golf cart injuries in general dates back to the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say their findings highlight the “inadequacy of robust safety features and the deficits in standard regulations.” But, leaving aside the possibility of waging a massive public campaign to dissuade kids from golf, that should also mean there’s plenty that can be done to reduce these injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Golf carts could be better designed to handle sharp corners, for instance, or to be less prone to tumbling over in general. Policy and lawmakers could also pass laws and regulations to encourage better safety.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some places have already started to do the latter. Just this year, South Carolina &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kids-sc-wear-seat-belts-100000821.html"&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; a law requiring children under 12 to wear a seat belt when inside these vehicles on public roads. In 2023, Florida also &lt;a href="https://www.motoelectricvehicles.com/blog/new-florida-law-raises-age-for-golf-cart-drivers/"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; to require that teens have a permit or license to drive a cart (previously, kids as young as 14 could drive without any license at all).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also say that people should be made more aware of the potential dangers of golf carts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the urgent need for increased awareness and attention to these injuries among children and demonstrate the crucial role of education on safe golf cart operation,” Ganley said.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pet videos just make you smile before you even know why. This Instagram Reel is a perfect example of that. Gamja and Chip, two &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; siblings with an endless appetite for silliness, were supposed to be downstairs when their human called for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve ever shared a home with dogs, you know obedience sometimes takes a back seat to fun. Instead of bounding down the stairs, the duo cooked up their own entertainment — one that looks less like mischief and more like an impromptu comedy routine. It’s pure Golden energy at its finest: goofy, carefree, and entirely on their own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owner-proves-how-pup-siblings-brain-cells-are-connected-in-video"&gt;Owner proves how pup siblings’ brain cells are connected in video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clip has already pulled in nearly 12K likes, which makes sense once you see what was happening upstairs. The video starts with their human climbing the stairs, a little puzzled about why the pups were ignoring her calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the top, the mystery unravels. Gamja and Chip can be seen sprawled out on the bedroom’s rug, rolling around like they’d just discovered gravity for the first time. Both were on their backs, paws in the air, legs flailing in a rhythm so uncanny it looked rehearsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Golden Retrievers are often called the clowns of the dog world, and here’s proof. Their wiggly bodies moved in near-synchronization. At one point, they pause dramatically before resuming what looked like a “synchronized derp routine,” as one commenter put it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another laughed at “Gamja’s karate kicks,” while a user said, “Them twinning made my day!” The replies even built on their human’s caption about “connected brain cells,” with one cheeky fan suggesting the pups “lost the brain cell in the carpet and are trying to absorb it back.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes the video of the pups even funnier is how unbothered they are about their owner’s calls. Rolling, kicking, and flopping against each other was clearly more important. The furbabies’ bond is obvious in the clip — not just as siblings, but as partners in perfect nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They can help to protect neurons — cells that transmit and receive messages to and from other tissues — during seizures and strokes, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21978" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21978" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;they prune unneeded connections between neurons&lt;/a&gt; during normal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microglia do a lot of important things,” says Chris Bennett, a psychiatrist who studies microglia at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “So, it’s not surprising that they are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those diseases include a suite of rare disorders caused by genetic mutations that directly affect microglia. Malfunctioning microglia have also been implicated in more familiar conditions with complex causes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01101-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01101-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson’s disease, as well as ageing, says Bo Peng, a neuroscientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune-cell swap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led researchers to investigate a tantalizing possibility: that replacing disease-causing microglia could treat some brain conditions. But swapping out microglia poses special challenges. Physicians typically replace a person’s immune cells by performing a bone-marrow transplant, which provides a fresh supply of stem cells that shelter in the bone marrow and give rise to many immune cells. Microglia, however, reside almost exclusively in the central nervous system, and typically replenish themselves by division rather than relying on stem cells in the bone marrow to send in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03931-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03008-5/d41586-025-03008-5_27185970.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians already use bone-marrow transplants to treat some rare diseases that affect microglia, such as a condition called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The treatment can be effective, says Marco Prinz, a neuropathologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but the results are inconsistent and typically replace only a small percentage of the recipient’s natural microglia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Peng’s team used bone-marrow transplants to replace abnormal microglia resulting from a fatal brain disease called CAMP (CSF1R-associated microgliopathy). The treatment was a success in both mice and in a small trial of eight people with the rare disorder: none of the eight participants experienced a decline in their motor or cognitive abilities in two years following the treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas members of a control group who did not receive the procedure experienced a deterioration of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for the success of the CAMP trial is the nature of the disease itself, says Bennett, because people with CAMP tend to produce relatively few microglia. This could leave space for the transplanted cells to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Onerous regimen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating that niche for the new microglia is a pivotal step in microglia replacement — and a source of concern. To make room for transplanted cells, physicians must first wipe out as many of the brain’s resident microglia as possible. This can entail high levels of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which can leave the recipient vulnerable to infection during the procedure and raise their long-term risk of cancer. That means that microglia replacement is, for the moment, too toxic to be used except in severe, rapidly progressing diseases such as CAMP, says Colella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If left unchecked, it significantly increases the risk of heart attacks, stroke, and other life-threatening cardiovascular complications. While statins are a widely prescribed and effective medication for managing cholesterol, cardiologists emphasize that certain natural foods can also help lower LDL cholesterol levels and promote long-term heart health through diet and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, incorporating oats and foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols into your daily diet can significantly reduce bad cholesterol and offer heart-protective benefits comparable to statins when consumed consistently and in appropriate amounts. Here’s a detailed look at these two powerhouse cholesterol-lowering foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Late Dinners Linked to High Cholesterol Levels, Experts Warn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding high cholesterol and its risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood that is essential for various bodily functions. However, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—commonly referred to as “bad cholesterol”—can build up in your arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe dietary changes can significantly impact cholesterol levels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since high cholesterol usually does not cause symptoms, it is often only detected through blood tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists stress that adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, including dietary changes, is crucial for keeping cholesterol under control and reducing cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Natural foods proven to lower LDL cholesterol and support heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oats: A natural cholesterol-lowering food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are rich in soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucan, which plays a key role in lowering high cholesterol levels. When consumed, beta-glucan forms a gel-like substance in the gut that traps cholesterol-rich bile acids, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your liver then uses more cholesterol from the blood to produce bile, naturally reducing LDL cholesterol levels. Clinical studies suggest that consuming approximately 3.5 grams of beta-glucan from oats daily over 3 to 12 weeks can result in a 4.2% reduction in LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forms of oats—including rolled oats, steel-cut oats, and oat bran—are excellent sources of beta-glucan. Beyond cholesterol management, oats also support digestion, maintain steady blood sugar levels, and contribute to overall cardiovascular wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Plant sterols and stanols: Nature’s statin alternatives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Some dairy products, like fortified milk and yogurt, are enriched with these compounds to provide a higher therapeutic dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in the British Journal of Nutrition indicates that consuming up to 3.3 grams of phytosterols daily can reduce LDL cholesterol by 6–12% within a month. These compounds work by competing with cholesterol for absorption, effectively lowering the amount of LDL in your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While phytosterols are naturally found in fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, nuts, and grains, the daily intake from these sources is usually below 600 mg—far less than the effective dose achieved through fortified foods. Cardiologists recommend including fortified foods with adequate plant sterols or stanols to achieve meaningful cholesterol reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate these foods into your diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To harness the cholesterol-lowering power of oats and plant sterols, consider the following practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your day with oatmeal or overnight oats topped with fruits and nuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include fortified dairy products like milk, yogurt, or spreads rich in plant sterols.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complement your diet with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to enhance overall heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have existing medical conditions or take medications, consult your cardiologist or a registered dietitian to ensure safe and effective cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

No other people are known to have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any person or animal that touched the bat or its saliva could be at risk, the agency said. Anyone who might have had contact with the bat should immediately seek medical evaluation or call Public Health at 206-296-4774 to see if preventive treatment is necessary, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once they develop an infection, the symptoms will vary. NDM-CRE can cause such ailments as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and wound infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms can include fever, chills with cough, shortness of breath if the bacteria infect the lung, and pain or blood when urinating if the bladder/kidneys are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the bacteria are resistant to most antibiotics, treatment options are severely limited, leading to slower recovery and higher risk of serious complications or death, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason health officials are concerned is because the bacteria can spread to others and survive on contaminated surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can test for NDM-CRE, but most people do not need to be tested unless they are at higher risk for having it, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those at risk are people who have been “in a hospital (especially in another country), had repeated antibiotics, hospital stays, or invasive medical procedures, or if you’re sick and been in contact with someone known to have NDM-CRE,” Gohil said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing for the bacteria is also difficult because many hospitals and clinics do not have the tools to rapidly detect it in patients even when the patient is not sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-ndm-cre" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against NDM-CRE&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;NDM-CRE is caused by overuse of powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be an opportunity for us to change the narrative where all patients typically want antibiotics,” Nanda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda advises patients who are being prescribed with antibiotics to ask their healthcare provider:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why they’re getting prescribed the antibiotics? Why is it necessary? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your options.

&lt;p&gt;The Eastern equine encephalitis virus has recently returned to Vermont, with mosquitoes in Orleans, Addison and Franklin counties testing positive for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging Vermonters to protect themselves from mosquito bites, warning the virus — while rare — can be serious and deadly to humans. Last year, one Chittenden County man in his 70s died of the virus in one of two cases of serious illness in the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in Swanton and Vergeness, and a horse in Brownington is also suspected of carrying the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Department of Health strongly encouraged Vermonters to take measures to prevent mosquito bites. Officials encouraged people to wear long-sleeve shirts and pants outdoors, use bug repellant that’s effective against mosquitoes, avoid leaving standing water and limit time outside around dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes may be more likely to carry the virus in areas where it’s been detected, said Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From June through October, technicians with the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets venture out to about 110 surveillance sites around the state, where they trap mosquitoes for testing, according to Patti Casey, who oversees environmental surveillance for the agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists with the agency currently monitor the West Nile virus, the Jamestown Canyon virus and the Eastern equine encephalitis virus. It’s the first summer state scientists have tested for the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/25/mosquitoes-test-positive-for-jamestown-canyon-virus-for-the-first-time-in-vermont/"&gt;Jamestown virus&lt;/a&gt;, with the first human case of the virus in Vermont &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/first-human-case-jamestown-canyon-virus-confirmed-vermont"&gt;confirmed earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s rare, people who do experience serious illness from EEE suffer from symptoms like fever, headache, vomiting or body aches. “The risk is low because most people don’t tend to get sick, but among those who do, it could be very dangerous,” Kwit said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those with symptoms, only 5% get seriously ill, Kwit said. But one-third of people who experience serious symptoms die, she said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last year’s EEE surge was the first time scientists saw an uptick in the virus in Vermont since 2012, Kwit said. Then, alerts from health officials prompted organizers in Vermont’s Queen City to &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2024/09/03/eee-has-come-to-vermont-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-mosquito-based-virus/"&gt;cancel a number of outdoor events&lt;/a&gt; or move them inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus typically comes to the Northeast in 8-to-10-year cycles, often ramping up for several years at a time, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that pattern happens because the virus “amplifies” in an exchange between mosquitoes and bird populations — and birds’ migration patterns bring the virus across the country, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary vector mosquitoes feed almost exclusively on bird populations. They transmit the disease among birds until many mosquitoes and birds are carrying the virus, Casey said. Then, bridge vector mosquitoes, which feed on birds and other animals, transfer the virus beyond birds — notably to humans and horses, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Horses cannot transfer the virus to humans and are recommended to be annually vaccinated for the virus, Casey said. Horses who are sick with the virus tend to suffer neurological symptoms, like falling over and stumbling, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, one horse in Brownington is suspected to have had the virus, but tests weren’t able to explicitly confirm it was infected, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kwit said no vaccine exists for humans, and there’s no approved treatment for people with symptoms. To protect themselves, people should follow recommendations from health officials, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

Found in virtually every tissue in the body, prostaglandins react to pain by producing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lowering excessive amounts of inflammation helps stop pain signals, small amounts of inflammation are crucial for helping the body fight off infections and heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means taking an NSAID not only eases pain but also reduces essential inflammation the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at NYU Langone Pain Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-25841710-9a20-11f0-b3ef-a9cd0ad000c9"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, however, discovered how to target prostaglandin-producing receptors without eliminating vital inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, the researchers looked specifically at prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in Schwann cells, which are found outside the brain in the peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This system is a network of nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body and Schwann cells are thought to be behind migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York City are testing the effects of pain relievers that target pain but not inflammation, which is needed in small doses for healing and fighting off infections (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said drugs that target pain but not inflammation would reduce the need for NSAIDs, which are sold under brand names like Advil (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found PGE2 has four different receptors. Of those, the team found that EP2 specifically is responsible for pain, while EP4 influences inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then used unspecified pre-clinical drugs on mice to target just the EP2 receptor. This reduced pain without affecting inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pierangelo Geppetti, study author and adjunct professor at the NYU Pain Research Center, said: 'Inflammation can be good for you - it repairs and restores normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inhibiting inflammation with NSAIDs may delay healing and could delay recovery from pain. A better strategy to treat prostaglandin-mediated pain would be to selectively reduce the pain without affecting inflammation’s protective actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery comes amid a rift in the scientific community regarding another pain reliever, acetaminophen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15123181/trump-links-tylenol-autism-cause-leucovorin.html"&gt;President Donald Trump earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; tied the pain reliever acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, during pregnancy to an increased risk of a child developing autism, despite inconclusive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63782-8"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at samples of human Schwann cells to determine which receptors to target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at mouse models, the team found injecting pre-clinical drugs, or those that are being studied but are not available to the public, into mice reduced their pain levels while leaving inflammation untouched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'To our great surprise, blocking the EP2 receptor in Schwann cells abolished prostaglandin-mediated pain but the inflammation took its normal course. We effectively decoupled the inflammation from the pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study findings come days after President Donald Trump (pictured here with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr) tied pain reliever acetaminophen to autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is sold under the brand name Tylenol, as well as other over-the-counter medications like Benadryl (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Developing drugs that only target EP2 would effectively eliminate the need for NSAIDs, which make up 30billion doses in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And long-term NSAID use has also been tied to gastrointestinal and kidney damage, so the researchers believe moving away from NSAIDs would help reduce these risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostaglandins also stimulate the production of a protective mucus lining in the stomach, so a reduction in all prostaglandins - which occurs when NSAIDs target all receptors, not just the one that controls pain - wears away at that layer and leaves the stomach lining vulnerable to acid and other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSAIDs also reduce blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it harder for the stomach lining to repair itself. Blood flow to the kidneys is also reduced, which hampers function over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear which specific drugs the researchers used in the study and when they might be available to the public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'Selective EP2 receptor antagonists could be very useful. While more research is needed on side effects, especially with giving a drug systemically as a pill, targeted administration that acts locally on an area like a knee joint holds promise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, highly potent class of immunotherapeutics with unique Velcro-like binding properties can kill diverse cancer types without harming normal tissue, University of California, Irvine cancer researchers have demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team led by Michael Demetriou, MD, Ph.D., has reported that by targeting cancer-associated complex carbohydrate chains called glycans with binding proteins, they could penetrate the protective shields of tumor cells and trigger their death without toxicity to surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their biologically engineered immunotherapies—glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR, pronounced 'glitter') compounds, GlyTR1 and GlyTR 2—proved safe and effective in models for a spectrum of cancers, including those of the breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas and prostate, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01032-3" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the holy grail—one treatment to kill virtually all cancers," said Demetriou, a professor of neurology, microbiology and molecular genetics at the UC Irvine School of Medicine and the paper's corresponding author. "GlyTR's velcro-like sugar-binding technology addresses the two major issues limiting current cancer immunotherapies: distinguishing cancer from normal tissue and cancer's ability to suppress the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmark research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's publication, the culmination of a decade of research, is a watershed moment and source of pride for UC Irvine and the UCI Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This landmark study is a paradigm shift with the very real potential to change how we treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;," said Marian Waterman, Ph.D., former deputy director of research at the cancer center and champion of the project since Demetriou, a UCI Health neurologist, began working on the concept in 2015 with his then-postdoctoral fellow, Raymond W. Zhou, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added Richard A. Van Etten, MD, Ph.D., director of the cancer center and an early supporter of the GlyTR project, "This novel technology may, for the first time, allow the widespread application of targeted T-cell therapy to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/solid+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;solid tumors&lt;/a&gt;, which is the 'holy grail' in the immuno-oncology field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chimeric+antigen+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chimeric antigen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (CAR) T therapy, use the body's white blood cells to attack cancer. They have largely worked only for blood cancers, such as leukemia. The GlyTR technology also proved effective in targeting leukemia, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Unorthodox approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many cancer researchers have sought protein biomarkers for specific cancers, Demetriou and Zhou aimed at a more abundant target, the unique coating of glycans that surround cancer cells but are found in very low density in normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complex sugar chains are the most widespread cancer antigens known but were generally ignored by researchers because they are inert to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, Demetriou and Zhou engineered the GlyTR compounds to attach themselves, Velcro-like, to glycan-dense cancer cells while ignoring low-glycan-density normal cells. Once attached, the GlyTR compounds identify the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; as targets for killing by the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, current cancer immunotherapies attack cells based on specific proteins regardless of their glycan density and thereby fail to distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second impediment to developing broadly active cancer immunotherapies is the shield glycans form around solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By targeting glycans and blanketing the tumor cells with the Velcro-like compounds, the GlyTR technology overcomes both obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human trials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing the therapy's safety and effectiveness in humans. Clinical grade GlyTR1 protein manufacturing is already being developed at the NCI Experimental Therapeutics program labs in Maryland, Demetriou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will enable the launch of a phase 1 clinical trial, which could begin within about two years. It will test the therapy in patients with a range of metastatic solid cancers. The highest glycan density is typically seen in patients with refractory/metastatic disease, a population that also has the greatest unmet need for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the revolutionary approach to cancer treatment our patients have been waiting for," said Farshid Dayyani, MD, Ph.D., medical director of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+center/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer center&lt;/a&gt;'s Stern Center for Clinical Trials and Research. "We are committing all available resources to bring this exciting new trial to UCI Health as fast as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

The difference was small but steady, and it held up across many types of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-the-aging-brain"&gt;Studying the aging brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Laura D. Baker, Ph.D., of &lt;a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wake Forest University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.advocatehealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advocate Health&lt;/a&gt;, and her team ran the study across five U.S. sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a large randomized clinical trial with 2,111 adults aged 60 to 79 who were at higher risk for decline due to factors like sedentary behavior, diet, and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were diverse by sex and ethnicity, and retention was high with 89 percent completing the two year visit. Safety was good in both groups, and adherence to the programs was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked global cognition, a combined score from several tests that sample &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, mental speed, and planning. It also looked at executive function, which reflects skills used to plan, switch tasks, and manage goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-aging-and-diet"&gt;Brain, aging, and diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structured program asked people to attend 38 small group meetings over two years and follow a clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals covered aerobic, resistance, and stretching exercise, diet targets, cognitive exercises, social activity, and regular health reviews with a study clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self guided program offered six group check ins and general encouragement, without coaching to specific targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both programs focused on the same core ingredients, they differed in intensity, structure, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet goals followed the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which blends features of Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt; eating patterns with emphasis on greens, berries, whole grains, beans, nuts, olive oil, and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational research has linked MIND style eating to slower cognitive decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mixed when the diet is tested on its own in randomized settings. A recent randomized trial did not find a cognitive benefit over three years, so diet likely works best alongside other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program also used computerized brain exercises. A PLoS Medicine meta &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found modest gains from such training in healthy older adults, and design details like supervision and frequency seemed to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-results-show"&gt;What the results show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two years, the structured group’s global cognition rose by an average of 0.243 standard deviations per year, while the self guided group rose by 0.213. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between groups, 0.029 per year, was statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive function improved more in the structured group by 0.037 standard deviations per year, while processing speed showed a similar pattern that did not reach significance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory scores did not differ between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits were consistent for people across age, sex, ethnicity, heart health, and genetic risk. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APOE ε4&lt;/a&gt; variant, a well known risk factor for Alzheimer disease, did not alter the pattern seen in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-big-is-the-benefit"&gt;How big is the benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 0.029 per year edge sounds tiny, and it is, but it was detectable on careful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; over two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steady gain suggests that structured support may help people keep pace or better, rather than slide as quickly as expected with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengths included high adherence, strong safety, and rigorous measurement. Fewer adverse events were recorded in the structured group despite the extra activity and contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One design limitation matters for interpretation. There was no no-treatment control group, so both programs may have lifted performance in part through education, coaching, and repeated testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-other-research"&gt;How this fits with other research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier Finnish multidomain &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60461-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, known as FINGER, also found that a combined approach to exercise, diet, brain training, and vascular care can help older adults at risk maintain thinking skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. POINTER was designed to test a similar strategy in a broader American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major commission has underscored that many risks for dementia are modifiable across the lifespan. Addressing multiple risks together aligns with that picture and may be more practical than chasing a single fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-aging-and-future-health"&gt;Brain aging and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential to improve cognition with fewer resources and lower participant burden is compelling,” said Baker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support and structure seem to matter, not just the ingredients. The results point to the value of clear goals, regular feedback, and a group that keeps you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The habits themselves are familiar, and that is part of the point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular moderate to vigorous activity, strength work, flexibility, a plant forward eating pattern, social connection, sleep attention, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, glucose, and cholesterol checks can fit into daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single habit is a magic bullet, and not every domain moved in the same way. The absence of a memory difference reminds us that brain health is complex and benefits may show up first in planning and mental speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults with medical conditions should tailor goals with a clinician to stay safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple steps that are repeated and supported are more likely to stick, and this study shows that even modest changes can matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 19:47:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQRGlibXBzYWFkeXV5UWF6RlRPMGNnSVQ0UUlhTlliRG1kZ0p3TUhfeHNWVnpqSGhuX3VDX1R5UDhrOFVOdTNzakU4cVNmNGo4dGR6eGE2TkRCaDdDZTZzbGE5ZXpRODRxS3dyMlRDMlpYTDN1OG1sRXc5YXFENGdINFpOcko4NlN5dzVSU0lsMnhNZjZSZlhnQkJvcmRVTjQ2OWFPUUh2WQ</guid></item><item><title>儿童压力与成年期慢性疾病密切相关，研究人员报告- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-childhood-stress-strongly-linked-chronic.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published by Duke University researchers has found a strong link between higher stress in children and adverse health conditions for them later in life. Appearing in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508549122" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; used measurable metrics of health over time to create a more quantitative view of how stress early in life affects health.&lt;/p&gt;

It gets underneath the skin, and it becomes embodied in the way your body handles stress," said co-author Herman Pontzer, Duke professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/allostatic+load/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;allostatic load&lt;/a&gt; (AL), which refers to the wear and tear on the body because of chronic stress. The researchers "tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health," relying on biomarkers that included antibodies of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation in the body; and the Epstein-Barr virus, which is common and highly contagious; body mass index; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by lead author Elena Hinz, a Ph.D. student in the Pontzer Lab at Duke, showed that a child's stress levels, in children as young as 9 to 11 years old, is an indicator of their cardio and metabolic health in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, researchers ask adults to remember their stress. Hinz and her fellow researchers used a big study that collected quantitative—not just qualitative—samples over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper's authors reviewed data from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS), a longitudinal study of child &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; that began in 1992—and continues today—to determine the need for mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Hinz, who grew up in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rural+community/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rural community&lt;/a&gt; in East Tennessee, said her own coming-of-age experiences spurred her interest in childhood stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm from the rural South and kind of have this idea of what stress looks like in that environment, in terms of childhood adversity and dietary stress and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+environment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical environment&lt;/a&gt; that kids are in," said Hinz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinz said humans combat acute stress through a fight or flight response: "Your body collectively reacts by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure when you are experiencing a stressful situation," she explained. "Those and other responses help you deal with that stress, but it's not good to always be in that state. I'm interested in what happens when that doesn't really subside."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty is at the crux of the study, which indicates a stable, financially secure home is essential for a healthy childhood free of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Children, eight, nine and ten years old—what's happening to them seems to be predictive of blood pressure," said Pontzer about early life stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What helps is education and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/job+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;job training&lt;/a&gt; and all of the stuff that gets communities out of poverty. That gets people the help they need when they need it, as opposed to health care cost barriers. Making sure that a kid knows there's going to be dinner and food on the table because that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychological+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychological stress&lt;/a&gt; isn't just psychological," said Pontzer. "It gets into the way your body works."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, a United Nations declaration is pledging to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York are laying out a new plan for combatting mental health challenges and non-communicable diseases. While their &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/09/25/default-calendar/fourth-high-level-meeting-of-the-un-general-assembly-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-ncds-and-the-promotion-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-(hlm4)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;political declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it also mentions neurological conditions like dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's historical for us. It's a real watershed moment," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about-us/meet-the-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paola Barbarino&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Alzheimer's Disease International, the advocacy group with members in 105 countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She said the inclusion of dementia is particularly significant for lower-income countries, many of which are still in "denial" about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Even in high-income countries where dementia gets attention, like the U.S., it has been a struggle to bring about the behavioral changes and medical interventions — such as weight loss and better blood pressure control — that could delay the onset of the condition. And, for many families dealing with dementia, finding adequate care and support is far from easy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the World Health Organization did put forward a &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/2098e5be-c7f3-4365-aebf-36204459794f/content" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global action plan on dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, which was extended earlier this year, Barbarino says, dementia is often missing or minimized in major policies, frameworks and discussions about non-communicable diseases. For example, WHO's 2022 report &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057661" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Invisible Numbers: The True Extent of Non-communicable Diseases and What To Do About Them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn't mention it. And in 2011 the U.N. did mention Alzheimer's disease in a declaration but did not make specific commitments to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO emailed this statement to NPR on Thursday: "The &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/pga/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/09/Finalized-PD-on-NCDs-and-Mental-Health-REV4-3-September-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; marks a significant milestone by recognizing the global impact of dementia and committing to scale up access to services for the 57 million people living with the condition worldwide." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR caught up with Barbarino — who has spent years as an activist and advocate — while she was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly to talk about the significance of this moment and what comes next. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dementia is one of the biggest health and care challenges of our time. And it's set to grow a lot in prevalence as the population gets older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea, last week, Australia declared dementia to be the leading cause of death. It is already among the biggest causes of death in the U.K., in the Netherlands, in Finland — in a lot more countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So it's actually extraordinary that it wasn't already included [in a U.N. declaration]. But this was not out of spite. It's simply because the stigma around dementia was so fierce that in the 1980s — when there was a movement for the other non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, respiratory disease — nobody was speaking about dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did it take for dementia to be included?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It has been probably two years of very serious work. We knew it was a problem beforehand but only recently did we realize that non-communicable disease mortality data [&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/probability-of-dying-between-exact-ages-30-and-70-from-any-of-cardiovascular-disease-cancer-diabetes-or-chronic-respiratory-(-)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published by the World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; often] focused on people below 70 years of age and not those above 70 years of age. Now, considering people are dying later, we cannot possibly not consider those last 20-some years of [life]. And it's in those 20 years, it's most likely that people will develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So we spent time collecting the data, doing evidence-based research. We published an article in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-024-01051-w#:~:text=Dementia%20is%20a%20neglected%20noncommunicable%20disease%20and%20leading%20cause%20of%20death,-Lewis%20Arthurton%20ORCID&amp;amp;text=Dementia%20is%20largely%20excluded%20from,effects%20are%20set%20to%20increase." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Review Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January. Dementia is expected to be the third leading cause of death globally in 2040. And people have listened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this declaration mean for countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, for high-income countries, a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;risk reduction factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for dementia [like anti-smoking efforts and campaigns to increase physical activity] are the same as those for other major diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. So governments can embrace this agenda a lot more solidly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A lot of low-income countries are still in denial about the fact that dementia is a big problem in their country. That stems from the fact that, in part, they consider themselves young countries, with more young people than old people. They're just not used to thinking about what's going to happen to the older population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often, when our members [in lower-income countries] ask for their government to have risk reduction campaigns, they are told that dementia is not a big condition in the country. Sadly, that [kind of denial] means people living with dementia are not receiving the care and support that they deserve. Same with caregivers. So this is a massive issue that is not going to go away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other thing that is changing is that in low-income countries, just as in high-income countries, there used to be a great reliance on family carers and often older people are now alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What difference can a U.N. declaration make on the ground for families dealing with dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We have reports from all over the world of people in distress, in angst, with massive mental health issues [because they or their family member has dementia]. And it is difficult if you are alone facing this. And if the community around them doesn't know what's happening, they can exclude you rather than include you, and that can become an extra burden. In our survey last year, we found out that a lot of carers — about 33% — stopped doing any social activity after a diagnosis, because they're ashamed and they don't know how to communicate [about dementia].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even at the highest level of government, dementia has so far been excluded. This U.N. declaration, for us, is really important because people now will be able to say: 'No, no. We are a major non- communicable disease.'&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But it's just one step and I am under no illusions. Getting [a dementia action plan] implemented country by country is going to take years — decades, maybe even.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that look like for lower-income countries, especially where health budgets are already tight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;[In some higher-income countries, there are medications on the market that aim to help] but, right now, we are aware that that's not possible [in many lower-income countries].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some countries, the infrastructure and regulatory approval is not there. The testing and diagnostic capacity are not there. Even the medical professionals — the psychiatrist, the neurologist, the geriatricians — are not there. And some of the treatments currently available are very expensive. Some countries can simply not afford them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it's not just medications that matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We were particularly keen for people to understand that you can live a better life if you can have better care. Many families report that once they get a diagnosis, they are left absolutely alone with no information whatsoever. But there can be basic helplines, basic support groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is only so much that civil society can do. This is about the government being conscious of the fact that this is a societal challenge. They have to embrace it just the way they've embraced other conditions, like cancer or heart disease. And ask questions like: How can it be integrated in our health care system? How much money can go towards it?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, as [with] everything that has to do with the U.N. it could remain just as a piece of paper. We need to make sure that there is implementation, that governments put in place public health campaigns that include dementia. We will do a lot of work to make sure that this becomes tangible for the people that live with dementia and for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in vision are often a common sign of aging. But what if we could reverse age-related visual decline? In a new study, UC Irvine researchers explore a possible therapy for addressing "aging" in the eye and for preventing diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;

The study was a collaboration between researchers from UC Irvine, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They outline their findings in "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice," a paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads5769" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the aging gene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is a follow-up to an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-gene-functional-role-aging-eye.html"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt; on Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), an established biomarker of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, also a faculty member at the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that work, the researchers found that enhancing ELOVL2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; in aging mice boosted levels of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more recent study sought to identify a way to bypass the need for the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As we age, changes in lipid metabolism lead to a decline in very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, which in turn affects our vision and can lead to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene is a key enzyme in the production of VLC-PUFAs as well as DHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting aged mice with the polyunsaturated fatty acid improved visual function. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking beyond the retina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-key-enzyme-lipid-metabolism-linked.html"&gt;immune system aging&lt;/a&gt;. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. It also suggested that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lipid+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lipid metabolism&lt;/a&gt; might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vision/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's well known that learning to play an instrument can offer benefits beyond just musical ability. Indeed, research shows it's a great activity for the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00931-2?cc%3Dy&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ISXm9wCpgIU0SZvhTtgIc"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; – it can enhance our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211949322000060&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0J924CbpX-5ltZlm_kS3Ku"&gt;fine motor skills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads7364&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1cQow2kqJZcULW8hCxR7nF"&gt;language acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1603984113&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1IENFgLXtEKL89DqXxVPzu"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2201655119&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw166FJkA0S7pBbFFnX7RsLT"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; – and it can even help to keep our brains &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg7056&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw14ZYapkVsmH9hr5auHz_xJ"&gt;younger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of working with musicians and witnessing how they persist in musical training despite the pain caused by performing thousands of repetitive movements, I started wondering: if musical training can reshape the brain in so many ways, can it also change the way musicians feel pain, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the question that my colleagues and I set out to answer in our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/9900/prior_use_dependent_plasticity_triggers_different.981.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1iOpLUyMOVJL8e-aUAhFRx"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells-repair-brain-damage-caused-by-stroke-in-mice"&gt;Stem Cells Repair Brain Damage Caused by Stroke in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already know that pain activates several reactions in our bodies and brains, changing our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590018306825&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1jaku2saW7RGkpVnd0VlTd"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/fulltext/2001/03000/pain_related_catastrophizing__what_is_it_.9.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3JNKyefXS4HwgSlWrTVnXn"&gt;thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as our way of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2eiv19D0l09QeV2obB-ESP"&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; and behaving. If you touch a hot pan, for example, pain makes you pull back your hand before you get seriously burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain also changes our brain activity. Indeed, pain usually reduces activity in &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590022003273&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3-56lqYYYUe4c4qbZeVN8X"&gt;the motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;, the area of the brain that controls muscles, which helps stop you from overusing an injured body part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reactions help to prevent further harm when you're injured. In this way, pain is a protective signal that helps us in the short term. But if pain continues for a longer time and your brain keeps sending these &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08ZXf5flpsMKxy23c3_ZA3"&gt;"don't move"&lt;/a&gt; signals for too long, things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you sprain your ankle and stop using it for weeks, it can reduce your mobility and disrupt the brain activity in regions related to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/painrpts/fulltext/2017/06000/the_impact_of_pain_related_fear_on_neural_pathways.8.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZNUxJblLM5UXSgeZMS53k"&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt;. And this can increase your &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08ZXf5flpsMKxy23c3_ZA3"&gt;suffering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1529943020300462&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0M99m4LJNtgPUHaTm8mLyU"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; levels in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also found that persistent pain can &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590019307448&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1g6bxlJt3m8U6unlkBPSvc"&gt;shrink&lt;/a&gt; what's known as our brain's "body map" – this is where our brain sends commands for which muscles to move and when – and this shrinking is linked with worse pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while it's clear that some people experience more pain when their brain maps shrink, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2829261&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1WneUxjBR0TcQvk8vCPrU8"&gt;not everyone is affected the same way&lt;/a&gt;. Some people can better handle pain, and their brains are less sensitive to it. Scientists still don't fully understand why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175452" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument.jpg" alt="Hands playing a piano" class="size-full wp-image-175452" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175452" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Learning to play an instrument can offer benefits beyond just musical ability. (TrueCreatives/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Musicians and pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, we wanted to look at whether musical training and all the brain changes it creates could influence how musicians feel and deal with pain. To do this, we deliberately induced hand pain over several days in both musicians and non-musicians to see if there was any difference in how they responded to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To safely mimic muscle pain, we used a compound called &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-008-1531-5&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0FgOCypdpQ7UldT_lSPvAH"&gt;nerve growth factor&lt;/a&gt;. It's a protein that normally keeps nerves healthy, but when injected into hand muscles, it makes them ache for several days, especially if you're moving your hand. But it's safe, temporary, and doesn't cause any damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we used a technique called &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneurophys/fulltext/2002/08000/basic_mechanisms_of_tms.6.aspx?casa_token%3DkndoZ2oPufEAAAAA:mu53jpmgWrbukvlluTW9Wg0ORqjMXMso9M1c_deQ6WXkxG1eVc9GZIwAnYJDyAJDLxK5wF4m0m7zH-yan31RIA&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2P3ZQOOdv3R6gBOuAhslRy"&gt;transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (TMS) to measure brain activity. TMS sends tiny magnetic pulses into the brain. And we used these signals to create a map of how the brain controls the hand, which we did for each person who took part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built these hand maps before the pain injection, and then measured them again two days later and eight days later, to see if pain changed how the brain was working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we compared the brains of the musicians and the non-musicians, the differences were striking. Even before we induced pain, the musicians showed a more finely tuned hand map in the brain, and the more hours they had spent practising, the more refined this map was found to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pain was induced, the musicians reported experiencing less discomfort overall. And while the hand map in non-musicians' brains shrank after just two days of pain, the maps in musicians' brains remained unchanged – amazingly, the more hours they had trained, the less pain they felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175456" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter.jpg" alt="Close up on man's open mouth" class="size-full wp-image-175456" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175456" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The differences between the brains of musicians and non-musicians were striking.

Their training seems to have given them a kind of buffer against the usual negative effects, both in how much pain they felt and in how their brain's motor areas reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn't mean music is a cure for chronic pain. But it does show us that long-term training and experience can shape how we perceive pain. This is exciting because it might help us understand why some people are more resilient to pain than others, along with how we can design new treatments for those living with pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-brain-system-that-repairs-your-body-while-you-sleep"&gt;Study Reveals Brain System That Repairs Your Body While You Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team is now conducting further research on pain to determine if musical training may also protect us from altered attention and cognition during chronic pain. And off the back of this, we hope to be able to design new therapies that "retrain" the brain in people who suffer from persistent pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the most exciting part: the idea that as a musician, what I learn and practise every day doesn't just make me better at a skill, but that it can literally rewire my brain in ways that change how I experience the world, even something as fundamental as pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was commissioned by &lt;a href="https://videnskab.dk/"&gt;Videnskab.dk&lt;/a&gt; as part of a partnership collaboration with The Conversation.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How our bodies break down and remove old and damaged bone tissue is linked to our inner circadian clock, according to a new study from the University of Surrey and the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16722-x" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, researchers focused on the processes involved in bone renewal: &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+resorption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone resorption&lt;/a&gt; (which allows the body to break down and remove old or damaged bone) and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+formation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone formation&lt;/a&gt; (which builds new bone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team examined &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from 22 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt;, collected every two hours for the span of 26 hours, and measured the presence of two markers: serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (sPINP), linked to bone formation and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (sCTX), linked to bone resorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples were collected under carefully controlled laboratory conditions that allowed a robust assessment of circadian rhythmicity in bone turnover markers. The findings show that while bone formation is not tied to our body's cycle, bone resorption is closely linked to our internal circadian clock. These novel findings provide important insights into the temporal regulation of bone metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrea Darling, Nutritional Sciences Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study, said, "This study has established a clear link between circadian rhythms and bone resorption (breakdown), which is a key process in maintaining bone integrity. As our study focused on healthy younger people, it will be interesting to find out, through future research, whether older individuals, and more specifically, those with osteoporosis, present disrupted circadian rhythms."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Professor Debra Skene, FMedSci, Section of Chronobiology at the University of Surrey and senior author of the study said, "Successful collaboration between chronobiology, nutritional sciences and bone metabolism researchers has led to these exciting new findings. More research into how misalignment of circadian rhythms, often seen in shift workers, might affect bone density and conditions like osteoporosis, is needed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Richard Eastell, Professor of Bone Metabolism at the University of Sheffield and one of the authors of the study, commented, "We knew that there was a diurnal rhythm of bone resorption markers already, but what this study has added is the constant routine protocol which allows us to conclude that the rhythm is a circadian one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Jones, Chief Executive of the Royal Osteoporosis Society, said, "This fascinating study sheds new light on the fundamental biology of how our bones are renewed. By showing that bone breakdown is tied to the body's &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/circadian+rhythms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, it opens up important new questions about whether disrupted sleep and shift work could increase people's risk of osteoporosis. As the UK's leading osteoporosis charity, we look forward to seeing how it could help improve prevention and treatment in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Maria Branyas Morera &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-branyas-morera-worlds-oldest-living-person-spain-dies-117/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives," Esteller said. "And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas "had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before," Esteller said. She also had "very good habits." She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt — eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans," Esteller added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study noted that "whether the dominance of the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas once &lt;a href="https://x.com/MariaBranyas112/status/1601512836932390914/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; about her love for yogurt, saying it "gives life" — and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one — free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges from studying Branyas "shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," the study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that to conduct the study, "samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity "are probably highly individualized processes," so "drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution." &lt;/p&gt;

The condition is typically asymptomatic, and people may live with it for years without knowing, until it turns into full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with prediabetes, doctors recommend foods that cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar rather than a rapid spike, including whole, unprocessed foods over packaged and sugary items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study is turning that advice on its head, with scientists concluding that high-sugar fruits may actually be the key to reversing prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tropical fruits contain between 10 to 50 grams of sugar, making them foods that people concerned about blood glucose &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584073/artificial-ingredients-food-drinks-organ-working-properly.html"&gt;try to avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But clinical nutrition researcher Raedeh Basiri said that mangos, despite having high levels of natural sugar, may offer protective factors for adults with prediabetes. People in the latest study who ate a daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mango also contains a wealth of vitamins, including A, C, B6 and E, plus key minerals like potassium and copper and more than five grams of fiber, a key nutrient that slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This prevents rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can, over time, cause type 2 diabetes, suffered by 37million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sugar content is not the only factor in picking the right foods. Fiber and vitamin content &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775847/Doctors-plant-diet-heart-disease-Type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;are just as important&lt;/a&gt;, and Basiri said in a statement: ‘Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Though tropical fruits are often avoided for their sugar, researcher Raedeh Basiri suggests mangoes could have protective factors for those with prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant signs that health was improving were observed in people in the mango group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their fasting blood glucose levels decreased, while the control group's levels increased, resulting in the mango group showing a clinically significant 18.3 mg/dL improvement by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mango group's fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's increased to 125.3 mg/dL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal range for fasting blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The marker for long-term blood sugar regulation in the mango remained stable but rose in the control group, proving that a daily mango exerted a protective effect against worsening blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits also extended to people’s body composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who ate mangoes showed decreased body fat percentage from about 31 percent to 29 percent, a relative reduction of nearly five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, the group that ate mangoes experienced a significant increase in fat-free mass, which is vital for a healthy metabolism, because muscle is a primary site for the disposal of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After 24 weeks, the mango group's (blue) fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's (orange) level increased to 125.3 mg/dL, a clinically significant difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows changes in people's waist-hip ratio at the start of the study and over the course of 24 weeks. The group consuming mango (blue) daily saw a significant decrease in their waist-to-hip ratio, a key indicator of health risk. In contrast, the control group (orange) experienced a significant increase in their ratio over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group showed no significant improvements in either marker, suggesting that incorporating a daily mango can be a practical dietary strategy for enhancing metabolic health and body composition in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/17/2971"&gt;Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri said: ‘It is not just the sugar content that matters, but the overall food context that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The goal is to encourage people to include whole fruits, like mango, as part of healthy eating behaviors and practical dietary strategies for diabetes prevention.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing prediabetes primarily involves adopting sustainable lifestyle habits that improve how your body uses insulin and manages blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key strategies include focusing on a balanced diet rich in fiber from vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting processed foods and sugary drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity is crucial. Experts say aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, per week to help muscles use glucose more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, getting adequate sleep and managing stress levels are key for preserving metabolic health and significantly reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQWDhCaks2X2FsNTQxQWpUamFKVmY4S3BJVXBxQ3BKWnV5cWcwNGJzdUY0cWNjNkpNM1loSmdEUHc5RWN3Z1VWMzJIME1iSEZkWWhnSTZwbHE2M1Jza0xSZTg0RmxzVWxlVTFxZHJfUmhxWGIyYTNCeGswXy11MmVjSEo4RmNubjAyTVZySnBDcnVveVQwbWRwd29SekhoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOLTNBRDdMTHZGOXRPWjFZSVJ3ZnFOOVNTOGdBZ3pTT3p6M3hZd1lOVy1qTENXZUIyalVad2doVEF1R3BfLTQ3aXZsaTEtSGt3ai1zMjBiNS1XMkZvVENnWG5JTnlrbU82YlVfLTVlelo2TDg5c1M2WFRtSXA2NDdUbElWMHI4MnpwMlNOWm9UYWY3WE5pd3pCUFQyWXFvSTJ0R0Fz</guid></item><item><title>逆转糖尿病的2 $水果...... 1亿美国人患有致命疾病，大多数人都不知道-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15133407/fruit-reverse-diabetes-mango-sugar-fiber.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists are offering people with a condition marked by blood sugar control counterintuitive advice that could actually halt a deadly disease progress in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 96 million adults and 8 million kids in America are living with prediabetes, a prelude to type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-52d87820-9a1e-11f0-8ab3-932b928d798f"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes medications, such as sulfonylureas, have been a mainstay of treating the disease since they came on the market in the early 1950s. However, although they are one of the most common drugs for this condition, it is not surprising that they lose effectiveness over time and have been seen to often cause more side effects than other antidiabetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The gears of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a chronic condition caused by an abnormal increase in blood glucose (hyperglycemia). It is a complex disease with various biological actors involved, but its main protagonists are insulin and pancreatic beta (β) cells: insulin is the hormone that allows blood glucose levels to be regulated, facilitating the exit of glucose from the bloodstream and its consequent entry into the cells so that they can be nourished; and β cells are precisely the ones responsible for producing insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 diabetes, the problem lies in the appearance of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and a progressive loss of function of the cells β that try to cope with it. The resistance of peripheral tissues to the effect of insulin forces β cells to produce more insulin and, over time, this overexertion leads to the loss of functional mass of β cells. Without them, insulin production drops and blood glucose levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Beta cells don't just die, they also change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the death of β cells was considered the main cause of the loss of functional cell mass in type 2 diabetes, but recently it has been seen that the loss of identity of these cells also plays an important role. It was known that this happened in mouse models, but now researchers corroborate it in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cells β not only die but also lose their functional identity and, although they are still alive, they revert to a state in which they are unable to produce and secrete insulin effectively," explains Dr. Eduard Montanya, leader of the Diabetes, nutrition and endocrine diseases group at IDIBELL, physician at the Bellvitge Hospital, researcher at CIBER and professor at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the UB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And it appears that sulfonylureas contribute to this loss of cell identity, increasing and enhancing their loss of function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The double face of sulfonylureas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonylureas are drugs capable of interacting directly with β cells to stimulate insulin secretion. Initially, they are effective in lowering blood glucose levels, but eventually lose the ability to restore glycemic control (which is known as secondary sulfonylurea failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, as seen by the researchers, continued exposure to these drugs contributes to the loss of β cell function. This would explain why they are progressively less effective in reducing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, which could accelerate the progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how this happens, Dr. Montanya's team has analyzed the effect of glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea, on healthy pancreatic β cells exposed to normal glucose conditions. The results are clear: cells exposed to the drug showed a reduction in the expression of genes essential to their function (including insulin expression itself), increased rate of cell death, and lose of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;-secretion capacity in response to glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have been able to confirm that glibenclamide has negative effects on β cells and accelerates the loss of functional mass, and that it does so in a time-dependent manner, since the involvement is greater the longer the exposure time," the researchers emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has shown that the mechanism by which sulfonylureas cause the loss of identity of beta cells is, at least partially, through the induction of stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular structure involved in the manufacture and modification of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Loss of identity, a potentially reversible phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these results provide a basis for understanding the loss of efficacy of sulfonylureas in the treatment of diabetes and their potential contribution to the progression of the disease, although more studies are needed to see how this finding translates into clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the other hand, knowing that in type 2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; some beta cells do not die, but revert to a non-functional state, opens a line of research of great clinical interest: unlike cell death, the loss of identity is a potentially reversible phenomenon. Thus, understanding how it is produced is key to proposing, in the future, possible therapies that reverse the process and recover the functional identity of cells to offer long-term solutions for diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfznjft3000i8mm657c9wbtb@published"&gt;My parents have always had some issues with respecting boundaries that my wife “Mia” and I set for our two boys, ages 5 and 7, but last weekend they did something that has my wife ready to cut them off for good.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusl6000l3b79wqpkznjl@published"&gt;My parents were scheduled to take the kids on Saturday morning and have them back by dinnertime while Mia and I attended the bar mitzvah of a friend’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzq5g35001j3b79uqa0bppv@published"&gt;When we got back in the late afternoon, we received a text with pics of my parents and our kids at a famous aquarium—one that is a plane-ride away from our home! Apparently my parents decided to surprise the boys. They had the trip in the works since we asked them to watch the boys—&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; clearing it with my wife and me.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusmz000m3b79t2q589y5@published"&gt;Once we saw the pictures, Mia called them, incensed, and demanded they return with the kids immediately. My parents said they’d be back Sunday evening, and then pretended their battery was dying and ended the call. We didn’t hear from them again until they were ready to board the plane the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpx7sq000z3b79n01f5c2k@published"&gt;Mia has been beyond furious and is adamant that my parents lose all access to the boys. While I realize my parents should have consulted us about going on the trip with the kids, I really think this is an overreaction. The kids had the time of their lives. Neither of them have any medical issues that would preclude a spur of the moment trip, and my parents are two caring, responsible adults. How can I convince my wife that going nuclear is not the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuszf000o3b793pobr2m1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Furor, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzput1g000p3b799p9oykp9@published"&gt;I mean, first I wouldn’t accuse her of “going nuclear”? I get why she’s mad, and also why whatever faith she might have had in your parents has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputck000q3b79qv4xuql5@published"&gt;Let’s review the facts: Your parents took your children on a flight and an overnight trip without your knowledge or consent. And then, when they were told to bring the kids back that same day, they refused, made up a lie about their phone battery, and presumably didn’t contact or take any further calls from you, &lt;em&gt;your children’s parents&lt;/em&gt;, until they were about to fly home the next day. To top it off, it sounds like they have not apologized and don’t believe they did anything wrong…which means they would probably feel justified in doing something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputf0000r3b79mta1lg04@published"&gt;Some people would say there’s a word for taking someone else’s children from home without their parents’ knowledge or permission, and then refusing to bring them back when they were told to! Of course I’m not saying that your parents had malicious intentions, or that your kids were ever in danger. Nor am I saying they need to be cut off forever. But when you kind of dismiss your wife’s anger by saying that your children had fun—I mean, that’s nice, I guess, but the amount of fun had by anyone is not even remotely the point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputo2000s3b79fr7klama@published"&gt;This incident has shown that you and your wife cannot trust your parents to 1) go through the (required and extremely basic!) process of informing you of what they plan to do with your &lt;em&gt;minor children &lt;/em&gt;and getting your permission to do things like keep them overnight or bring them on a flight somewhere, or 2) listen and actually do what you ask where your children are concerned. I see how those things would be dealbreakers for some, especially if this wasn’t a one-time thing, but just the latest and wildest way your parents have shown their disrespect for you, your wife, and your authority as parents. And it sounds like this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; part of a larger pattern—you said yourself that your parents have a history of not respecting the boundaries you and Mia put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputr5000t3b797ksgjtpa@published"&gt;(I have just reread your letter and noted that your parents &lt;em&gt;were planning this all along&lt;/em&gt; and chose not to read you in. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fun, spontaneous decision they made without telling you, which still would have been weird; they made their plan, bought the tickets, reserved a hotel, and then chose to deceive you about it every moment leading up to the trip. ABSOLUTELY WILD BEHAVIOR. Like, did they &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;think this was normal? I’m actually kind of worried about them, if so.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu4g000u3b79m7mbbd9b@published"&gt;Maybe your wife is saying that she doesn’t want your parents to have access to your kids because she really doesn’t feel like she can currently trust them. If you and Mia tell them to do X or don’t do Y with the kids, Mia doesn’t know whether they’ll listen. Maybe she’s really pissed and just doesn’t want to see them for a good long while—honestly, that makes sense to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu8m000v3b79v6e3jk25@published"&gt;Instead of telling your wife that she’s overreacting, or trying to talk her out of how she feels, listen to what she’s saying and try to understand where she’s coming from. Acknowledge that what your parents did was unacceptable, and that Mia has a right to be upset. After that, perhaps the two of you can eventually get to a point where you can discuss ways your parents might see the kids, under conditions you both can live with (e.g.: visits at your house with at least one parent present, after a break/cooldown period, if your parents promise that nothing like this will never happen again?). Mia might really need some time before she can consider this, or see your parents herself, so try to respect that. The point is that it shouldn’t be you against your wife, or you and your parents against your wife. It should be you and Mia acknowledging what your parents did wrong, acknowledging the other person’s feelings, and trying to problem-solve together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuuh2000w3b79conm21yc@published"&gt;Finally, I will add that, whether or not your parents see the kids any time soon, it seems super clear that they shouldn’t be left alone in charge of them again. If you can’t even trust them to do what you ask regarding your kids or run things like &lt;em&gt;plane trips&lt;/em&gt; by you first, they can’t be your go-to caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

A peek at how the shot has been working so far in the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season shows the vaccine is cutting down on flu-related hospitalizations by half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7c5b1" class="body-graf"&gt;But the percentage of kids getting their flu shots has been falling in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f76663" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the CDC, fewer than half of kids (49.2%) had their flu shot last year, down from 62.4% in the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44beda" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Leary said that reasons for the decline are complex. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;Increasing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is just one factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5465e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of families are experiencing access to care issues,” he said. “And a lot of practices are experiencing significant staffing issues.

Researchers will track how dopamine interacts with oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin and supporting neuron function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project aims to uncover whether dopamine regulates myelin plasticity, potentially linking isolation, addiction, schizophrenia, and other conditions. The findings could open doors to treatments for disorders involving myelin breakdown, from neuropsychiatric disease to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel Hypothesis:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine may regulate myelin plasticity via oligodendrocytes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Social isolation alters dopamine levels and myelin structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may apply to conditions like addiction, MS, and schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CUNY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists know that social isolation can alter brain structure and lead to the breakdown of myelin, the fatty coating that insulates nerve fibers in the brain. But they don’t yet know exactly how or why it happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, five-year study, supported by the National Science Foundation, investigates the potential mechanisms that drive the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re looking at the role of dopamine in regulating changes in myelin caused by social isolation,” said study leader Leora Yetnikoff, a professor of Biology and a member of the CUNY Neuroscience Collaborative at the CUNY Graduate Center, and a professor of psychology at the College of Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yetnikoff was recently awarded a $1 million NSF CAREER award to examine how dopamine affects  oligodendrocytes, the specialized cells in the brain and spinal cord that make myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced genetic and imaging tools, her team will observe how dopamine interacts with these cells and whether changing dopamine levels can reverse the effects of social isolation on myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, myelin is believed to be an insulator of axons,” Yetnikoff said, referring to the long and slender nerve fibers that carry messages from neuron to neuron using electricity. The myelin coats axons much like insulation on a wire, paving the way for these electrical signals to travel faster for better communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, newer research focuses on oligodendrocytes as metabolic supporters, supplying the molecules to help power electrical signals traveling through axons in the brain. And without this support, axons can weaken or degenerate, the professor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the question people are starting to ask is, ‘What other functions are these cells playing besides producing myelin?” Yetnikoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project will focus on three areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is a novel role for dopamine, which is viewed as a key neurotransmitter involved in synaptic plasticity,” she said, referring to the brain’s ability to strengthen or weaken the connections between neurons and how the brain changes with experience — making learning, memory, and adaptation possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work that we’re doing suggests — and we haven’t proven it yet — that dopamine may be communicating with the oligodendrocytes to make myelin plastic, and that’s a novel form of plasticity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second looks at the broader implications of dopamine’s effect on myelin in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Social isolation is only one phenomenon that causes changes in myelin plasticity,” said Yetnikoff, pointing to brain injury and  neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is involved in all these conditions. Right now, we’re just looking at social isolation, but the implications are that it could potentially be involved in many other conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third area relates to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;social isolation and the external factors that cause it.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’ve just come out of the COVID pandemic,” said the professor, “and there’s social isolation among the elderly. It can occur in youth, when they lock themselves up with video games and computers. So, how is that affecting the brain and what are the mechanisms involved?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1960s, animal studies have shown that social isolation can result in altered levels of dopamine, the neurochemical most linked to motivation and pleasure. Yet, scientists are only beginning to piece together the connections between dopamine and myelin plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yetnikoff points to a seminal study, which tracked more than 100 children in Romanian orphanages. The researchers found that neglect and psychosocial deprivation led to abnormal brain development in the orphans, especially in the prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher-level cognitive function and impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;That work showed that myelination in their prefrontal cortex, as well as other myelinated tracts, was decreased compared to non-neglected orphans,” she said&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If her study can identify the mechanisms involved in demyelination that occurs with social isolation, she said, there’s potential to gain critical insights on other conditions seen with the deterioration of myelin — drug addiction, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, and other neuropsychiatric diseases among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student researchers will train in the Yetnikoff Laboratory, using cutting-edge technology over the five-year-life of the project. Yetnikoff credits her students for doing much of the work that went into the proposal that won the NSF grant. “None of this would’ve happened without them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Yetnikoff received a young investigator grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for her work on dopamine and adolescence in 2017, and a SCORE Award from the National Institutes of Health for her research on glial cells in 2021. She was granted the CUNY Feliks Gross award for outstanding research in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and social isolation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aedddcc6cbcfeec9cd80cddbc0d780cbcadb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shawn Rhea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gc.cuny.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CUNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shawn Rhea – CUNY&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:56:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5sdDUwaU1UQUY2cEtvNmhXNWpZWUlPSVlnaUdySmJTNUNGcEhjSzlUY1JjWGdBMGxwaEFUN2RHclppSWVkcHEtZzMycEZFU3JSa0JucmdnX0FTaG5FUFZqOTJIOF9oVWt0MHZ5UDg2SlFvazY0WHNz</guid></item><item><title>电子烟对牙齿和口腔健康有什么影响？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/25/impact-vaping-teeth-oral-health-decay</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QAndAExplainerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-smoking-bad-for-teeth" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is smoking bad for teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A hefty proportion of vapers are former smokers or smoke as well as vape, so the first port of call is the impact of smoking. Humans started smoking long before modern science and there is a wealth of robust evidence on its health effects. The message is clear: smoking is extremely damaging to oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the bad breath, brown stains and loss of taste, tar and toxins in tobacco smoke increase the risk of gum disease. In severe cases, this can cause teeth to fall out. The disease can be harder to spot in smokers though, because nicotine reduces blood flow in the gums. This makes them less likely to bleed, which is one of the early warning signs of disease. Smokers may also struggle to overcome gum disease because of the continued onslaught of smoke and the effect smoking has on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer throughout the body and more than half of mouth cancers are linked to the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-vaping" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about vaping?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The impact of vaping on teeth and oral health is still being thrashed out. Far fewer studies have looked at the issue and many that have are flawed. A common problem is that studies fail to ensure vapers are not smoking cigarettes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The absolute effects of vapes and their impact on oral health are unknown,” a spokesperson for the British Dental Association said. But they added that recent, limited evidence did raise concerns over oral dryness, irritation and gum disease caused by vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-studies-say" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What do the studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at Newcastle University published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41432-025-01119-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;major review&lt;/a&gt; this year into the impact of vaping on periodontal health, meaning the gums, ligaments and bone that supports our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two markers of long-term disease are bone loss and pockets in the gum tissue around teeth, but there was no evidence these were any worse in vapers than in non-smokers or former smokers. The vapers did have slightly worse gum disease, “but it was pretty marginal”, said Dr Richard Holliday, a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Again, the evidence is tentative, but there are some concerns. In &lt;a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177%2822%2900577-3/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers analysed patient records for more than 13,000 people who attended dental clinics between 2019 and 2022. “Patients who vaped did show an increased risk of developing dental caries when compared to non-smoking and non-vaping patients,” Dr Karina Irusa, the study’s first author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Newcastle team also found higher levels of plaque in vapers compared with non-smokers or former smokers, which would be in keeping with a greater risk of dental caries. But more studies are needed to investigate whether vaping itself is to blame for tooth decay. There’s evidence that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5269575/#:~:text=Nicotine%20dependence%20was%20positively%20correlated,context%20of%20depression%20and%20stress." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nicotine users eat more sugar&lt;/a&gt;, so vapers may have bad teeth for reasons other than their nicotine habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-might-vaping-cause-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How might vaping cause tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A common claim is that sugar in flavoured vapes drives tooth decay, but manufacturers tend to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. This is because sugar burns at vape-operating temperatures, so using them would produce a burnt flavour and clog up the heating coil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If vaping does drive tooth decay, Holliday suspects that having a dry mouth, which vapers often mention, is part of the problem. “Saliva is a wonderful thing to protect your teeth. When you reduce that, tooth decay can happen more rapidly and gum disease can happen more rapidly, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saliva helps to keep teeth clean and it also contains calcium and phosphate that help withstand acid attacks from bacteria, and from drinks such as fruit juices, which are the key drivers of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How vapes cause a dry mouth isn’t entirely clear, but vape liquids are the prime culprits. They are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol, which are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb and hold on to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-cancer" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who vape do not inhale anything like the number and variety of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. For this reason, the risk appears low. But it is an area scientists are watching, because vapers are still regularly inhaling chemicals into their bodies and the long-term effects on the delicate tissue in the lungs and elsewhere are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-vaping-safe-for-young-people" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is vaping safe for young people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, summed it up like this: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.” According to Holliday, that is sound advice. “If you’re a young person, don’t vape,” he said. “You are putting something into a complicated ecosystem, so there will be risks from vaping long term.

                                        &lt;p&gt;GOMA, Congo (AP) — As a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;deadly new Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kills dozens in southern Congo, health authorities and organizations are sounding the alarm, warning they lack the funds and resources to mount an effective response to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said Wednesday that 57 cases and 35 deaths have been reported since the outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 4. The fatality rate is over 61%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation’s capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,” said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16"&gt;U.S. funding cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo’s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-agency-for-international-development"&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFRC’s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of USAID, Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, said that the U.S. government has provided “some small support,” though he could not provide specific details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that the organization’s only current funding for the outbreak response is a $2 million emergency fund and around $2.3 million from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gavi-alliance-vaccines-us-funding-3123781dd776b0019d4f869789e2715e"&gt;Gavi vaccine alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is far below the WHO’s projected cost of around $20 million to respond to the outbreak over the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities,” Jasarevic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congolese authorities’ current national response plan is estimated at $78 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating Ebola demands “enormous resources,” even for a single patient, said Jean Paul Mbantshi, the chief medical officer of the Bulape health zone. He said the zone desperately needs ambulances to transport patients from remote areas to the hospital before they become highly contagious. Health workers also require more protective equipment, medicine, and additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“All this costs money, we need more support,” Mbantshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, just 1,740 people in three health zones of Kasai province — Bulape, Bulambae and Mweka — have been vaccinated as of Sept. 21. The Bulape zone alone has a population of more than 212,000, according to 2020 figures from the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO said the vaccination campaign has not been implemented as fast as desired because of logistical challenges. A lack of storage infrastructure in Bulape, for instance, has forced officials to transport vaccines in small batches, causing delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amitié Bukidi, chief medical officer of the Mweka health zone, said the response is still in the early stages, with the majority of cases occurring outside of health centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to expand our community outreach, especially by raising awareness among opinion leaders, to reach farmers who are hardest to reach,” Bukidi said, adding that his team needs motorcycles to reach remote, hard to access areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“The need is still very great,” he said. “If USAID were to be involved, that would be good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banchereau reported from Dakar, Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A deadly repeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year by year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then often progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antisense therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hopes dimmed in 2021&lt;/a&gt; after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Molecular muzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Nobel Prize last year&lt;/a&gt;, although the technology &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;has yet to yield any approved medicines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed adults, many with chronic pain, and found that optimism, restorative sleep, social connections, and stress management strongly protected against accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans revealed that participants with the most protective factors had brains up to eight years younger than expected. These results suggest that lifestyle habits can measurably slow brain aging and strengthen resilience even in vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Age Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure comparing MRI-based “brain age” to real age shows lifestyle impacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep, optimism, stress management, and social support slowed brain aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Brains looked up to 8 years younger in participants with healthy habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;University of Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;strong&gt;our chronological age may say 65, but your brain could be acting a decade younger — or older — depending on your  life experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from a new study by University of Florida researchers, who found that optimism, good sleep, social support and other positive factors were strongly linked with healthier brains. The findings suggest that how people live and cope with stress can measurably influence the pace of brain aging, even in those living with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are things that people have some level of control over,” said Jared Tanner, Ph.D., a research associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida who helped lead the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can learn how to perceive stress differently. Poor sleep is very treatable. Optimism can be practiced.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research followed 128 middle-aged and older adults, most with chronic musculoskeletal pain associated with or at risk of knee osteoarthritis, for two years. Using MRI scans analyzed by a machine learning system, the team estimated each participant’s “brain age” and compared it to their actual chronological age. This brain age gap between the two served as a measure of whole-brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressful factors like chronic pain, low income, less education and other social risks were associated with older-looking brains. Those links seemed to make less of an impression over time. What stood out more clearly were protective elements: things like getting restorative sleep, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding tobacco and having supportive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported the most protective factors had brains eight years younger than their chronological age when the study started, and their brains went on to age more slowly over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The message is consistent across our studies,  health promoting behaviors are not only associated with lower pain and better physical functioning, they appear to actually bolster health in an additive fashion at a meaningful level,” said Kimberly Sibille, Ph.D., an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UF and senior author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibille and Tanner, along with colleagues across UF and at other institutions, published their findings Sept. 11 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that older brains are more vulnerable to problems like memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Traditionally, brain research has focused on individual regions. But since pain, stress and life experiences affect many parts of the brain at once, the brain age gap — the difference between a person’s age and how old their brain looks in brain scans — provides a single, whole-brain snapshot that captures those complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study focused on people living with chronic pain, it’s likely that factors like lower stress, social support and quality sleep serve to slow brain aging in other populations as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Literally for every additional healthy promoting factor there is some evidence of neurobiological benefit,” Sibille said. “Our findings support the growing body of evidence that Lifestyle is medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2e39222865232a2622273f24250b3e2d27652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ufl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Hamilton – University of Florida&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/a&gt;” by Jared Tanner et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay between chronic musculoskeletal pain and brain aging is complex. Studies employing machine learning models to assess relationships between brain age and chronic pain generally show higher chronic pain severity associates with older brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses to date have not considered individual and community level socioenvironmental risk factors or behavioral/psychosocial protective factors as potential modifiers of cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age. This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between chronic pain, socioenvironmental risk, behavioral/psychosocial protective factors, and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample comprised 197 adults (Men:Women = 68:129) from a prospective observational cohort study. Most individuals reported knee pain and were with/at risk for osteoarthritis. A subset of 128 participants (Men:Women = 41:87) completed a follow-up MRI session at two years and were included in the longitudinal analysis (Aim 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 45–85 years of age and self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White. Data collected included demographics, health history, pain assessments, individual and community-level socioenvironmental factors (education, income, household size, marital and insurance status, and area deprivation index) coded as a summative socioenvironmental risk variable, and behavioral/psychosocial factors (tobacco use, waist circumference, optimism, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, perceived social support, sleep) coded as a summative behavioral/psychosocial protective factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI data was used to estimate brain age applying a machine learning approach (DeepBrainNet). Cross-sectional analyses utilized regression and analysis of variance, while longitudinal analyses utilized a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk associated with an increased brain age gap (the difference between chronological age and predicted brain age). Participants who had higher socioenvironmental risk had brains that were about three years older than participants with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more behavioral/psychosocial protective factors correlated with a lower brain age gap; participants with higher behavioral/psychosocial protective factors had brains that were over three years younger than participants with fewer behavioral/psychosocial protective factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinally, higher baseline behavioral/psychosocial protective factors associated with lower brain age over the two-year span, beyond the effects of chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show behavioral/psychosocial protective factors may counteract neurobiological aging and help buffer the brain from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:18:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBuNkgxdVFSaWlfUHJORjNpTzcwQjl4a2thc0wzTDQ2QkFGZGxUX25jSkhtQjMxX0lnai1MQ1pYWWt5NlV2SW82TmxhbVRYTUQ4LUhnNi0wZnRGY1ZpdkdqTGNiZkJUZGM0</guid></item><item><title>疫苗接种和遗忘的代价-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/0feb1f55-4644-4ecb-9ea8-cab185413df7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT newspaper delivered Monday-Saturday, plus FT Digital Edition delivered to your device Monday-Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5WZ1o5cUxFQXM2RV91Nm8yV1Q4UEl2LXRsQXJGZnV6alNZdDR5NTdQLXhoWXpWaThQS2pmWUY3Y3V6Q1lURVM2RzBOYjdaTGFDNVlIVmNqYWxFVDR3dmtobXhWYzlrNk5panAxVzJ2bmQ</guid></item><item><title>如何通过更换包装和厨房用具来减少食品中的微塑料- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-food-by-changing-packaging-and-kitchen-utensils/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that normal use of plastic packaging and kitchen gear can shed tiny particles into what we eat and drink. It maps the science and suggests practical ways to cut everyday exposure to these microplastics from our food without turning daily routines upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reviewed evidence across many product types and everyday actions, from twisting open a cap to steeping a tea bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also launched an open dashboard that lets anyone explore where particles show up and how tests were done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-food-packaging"&gt;Microplastics in food packaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Lisa Zimmermann, from the &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Packaging Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich led the work. She was joined by collaborators from &lt;a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eawag&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed 103 studies and found that most reported plastic particles (microplastics or nanoplastics – MNPs) in foods or test liquids that had touched packaging or tools made with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also logged which test methods were used and how carefully the studies controlled for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only seven of the 103 studies met the highest reliability bar for answering the core question about particle release under normal use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one third used a kinetic design, for example, measuring how particle levels change with time, temperature, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first systematic evidence map to investigate the role of the normal and intended use of food contact articles in the contamination of foodstuffs with MNPs,” explained Dr. Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-microplastics-get-into-food"&gt;How microplastics get into food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use the term microplastics for plastic particles roughly 1 to 1000 micrometers in size. Even smaller pieces are nanoplastics, which are below 1 micrometer and can be harder to detect with current methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The items that touch food are called food contact articles, and they include &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;bottles&lt;/a&gt;, caps, pouches, wraps, cartons with plastic liners, tea bags, cutting boards, utensils, and parts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; processing machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these materials are polymers. These long, chain molecules can shed fragments when stressed by heat, abrasion, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61146-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; measured particle release during typical steps used to open packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that everyday actions like tearing a bag, scissoring a wrapper, or twisting a cap can generate plastic fragments. Heat and time can add to the stress, so hotter food contact and longer storage often matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-packaging-swaps-that-cut-microplastic-exposure"&gt;Packaging swaps that cut microplastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymer tea bags are an easy place to start. A single plastic tea bag, steeped around 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius), released about 11.6 billion microplastic and 3.1 billion nanoplastic particles in one cup, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose loose leaf tea with a stainless steel infuser or paper tea bags that are not sealed with plastic. If you do use bagged tea, avoid squeezing the bag or stirring it hard because added agitation can increase wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store drinks and sauces in glass or stainless steel when you can, and keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/agricultural-soil-is-now-the-worlds-biggest-plastic-dumping-ground/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; contact time short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you open a bottled drink, pour it into a glass rather than sipping and re capping many times. This will reduce friction at the threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for packaging that minimizes plastic on parts that rub, such as caps, spouts, and seals. Simpler closures with fewer plastic-on-plastic contact points are generally better for abrasion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smarter-utensils-and-kitchen-habits"&gt;Smarter utensils and kitchen habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting boards deserve attention because knives grind directly into the surface. Plastic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19440049.2021.2017002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cutting boards&lt;/a&gt; have been traced as the source of polyethylene fragments found in retail meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap plastic boards for wooden or glass models for most chopping tasks. If you keep plastic boards for raw meat handling, replace them when deep grooves appear and avoid heavy scraping that chews up the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use utensils that do not gouge soft plastics. Metal tips on soft plastic containers can scrape particles, so choose wooden or silicone tools for stirring inside plastic tubs, and preferably mix in glass or stainless steel bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid heating food in disposable plastic containers. Move leftovers into glass or ceramic before reheating so the hottest temperatures do not hit plastic parts that can wear under heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-health-and-microplastics"&gt;Food, health, and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is rapidly evolving on what these particles do in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; followed surgical patients who had some of their tissues analyzed for microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that patients with microplastics in plaque that was removed from neck arteries had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. They were followed over roughly 34 months, in the time following the analysis of their tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That result does not prove cause and effect, but it raises fair questions about reducing avoidable exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evidence map also stresses that better methods and consistent reporting are needed so scientists and regulators can compare results across labs with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy steps are on the table. The authors argue that regulators can require tests of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/most-energetic-neutrino-ever-detected-captured-at-km3net-mediterranean-sea/"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; migration from packaging and tools under real-use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could include investigations of the effects of time, temperature, and repeated use cycles. Harmonized testing would help industry design safer products and help shoppers make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are simple changes you can make today. Choose tea that avoids plastic, pick glass or stainless for hot foods and long storage, and keep plastic surfaces smooth and unscored by replacing worn items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-025-00470-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Science of Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:26:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPNkUyUTdMVTRaaTJScE5LMi1hS0NlaWIyVEdOVWJmUURmNXhSQmJFLWh4Y2ltSTV3ZFNteHFqX3hmempFUFVrSjRYbGtsMVpnV1hiRVRUdUE1UEZqbUItY3FEQUJ2ZjJ4dzhfTjBHZTlkNWpsU3RmLWVtTjhPcEVRWVdiNFBXMEYwcV96OEVNcm03clRTVWl4R3ZtdjVMLWg3UXBmQ242UW91Zw</guid></item><item><title>人体骨骼深处发现微塑料，科学家警告- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Researchers suspect that microplastics may be a contributing factor, along with other established risks like drinking and an aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet still, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastics-impact-on-health-costs-1-5-trillion-every-year-report-warns"&gt;experts warn,&lt;/a&gt; we're increasing this "underrecognized danger," producing at least &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/pl/node/71013"&gt;400 million metric tons&lt;/a&gt; (441 million US tons) of plastic each year, a process contributing &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/plastics"&gt;1.8 billion metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of greenhouse gases per annum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxicologists-urge-for-research-into-the-unknown-health-risks-of-microplastic"&gt;For years now&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have been calling for more resources to investigate the impacts these &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/08/how-plastics-contribute-to-climate-change/"&gt;problematic petrochemical pollutants&lt;/a&gt; are having on our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we can somewhat reduce our exposure to microplastics by filtering our drinking water and limiting plastic products, from &lt;a href="https://www-sciencealert-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-from-synthetic-clothes-are-polluting-land-even-more-than-water"&gt;synthetic clothing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bottled-water-is-packed-full-of-up-to-100x-more-microplastic-than-expected"&gt;plastic drink bottles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-025-07580-4"&gt;Osteoporosis International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
