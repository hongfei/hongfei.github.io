Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;None of the three patients in New York State, two of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, the second in February and the third in mid-March. The first two patients have recovered and the third, an unvaccinated child under 5 years old from Suffolk County, was being treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens, the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;state’s Department of Health said&lt;/a&gt; on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s Health Department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Sometimes she slurs her words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When she notices that her pill supply is mysteriously dwindling, she asks her children if they’re stealing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You don’t have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?” her daughter, Piper, asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The White Lotus” is not the only show to recently feature these drugs.

so infectious&lt;/a&gt; it can still cause breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, a teacher from Ontario, was exposed when one of her unvaccinated students came to school with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The child fell sick and after diagnosis, health officials told Marcy and her class to isolate for up to 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said she had been doubled-vaccinated as a child and received a booster after she was exposed, but over the next six days, she developed a fever that continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the charac&lt;span&gt;teristic rash came. It erupted all over her face, and spread down her neck to her back, arms and legs — covering them in bright red spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a booster, and I still developed the infection — in fact I started to get a fever six days after my booster,' Marcy said on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy, pictured above, developed the measles after being exposed to an infected unvaccinated child in the school where she worked in Ontario, Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I got a mild fever at first, and then it got worse and worse, instead of getting better, which should have been the first clue.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in Texas, where more than 250 people have been infected while at least 29 have been hospitalized and two are reported to have died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the patients, just five (or 2 percent) were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an outbreak in Ontario that has sickened at least 177 people, mostly children at the state's schools. Marcy is a patient in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these patients, just eight were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine prevents infections in the vast majority of cases, but the CDC says online that about three in 100 people who receive the vaccine could still be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients tend to suffer a more mild infection, however, and avoid the worst effects of measles including encephalitis, or brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, who revealed her case on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcyteaches/video/7472085787752893751"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said that she had received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child — which are administered at the ages of 12 months and four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But blood tests in the hospital revealed she had no antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, people who are fully vaccinated against measles will have antibodies in their blood, although in some cases these may not be picked up in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians gave her a booster dose against measles and discharged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible for immunity from the vaccine to wane over time, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. It is not clear whether Marcy had any underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her diagnosis online, she said: 'Hello, so I have, the measles', before gesturing to her rash-covered face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy is pictured above attending Taylor Swift's Eras tour more than a month before she was diagnosed with the disease. There is no risk that she could have been infected at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added in a comment: 'I was vaccinated as a child but my [tests] showed no evidence of immunity. They recommended a booster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said doctors initially thought her temperature was caused by the norovirus, before the rash erupted — leading to a measles diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn't feel the rash appear, but said that after a few days it started to itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I developed a rash without even feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was at home, minding my business, and then my husband came home and took a look at my face and said, "What the heck happened to your face?!".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I looked in the mirror and it's got a little worse, I am hoping the rash starts to get better tomorrow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Taylor Swift super-fan is pictured above before she was diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rash lasted for about five days before clearing, she said in the clip that was posted in mid-February and has been viewed nearly 20,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was able to return to work five days after her rash appeared, which is when someone is no longer infectious for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But said she was frequently exhausted and would come home from work and sleep immediately every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccination rates against measles have fallen in recent years amid false claims that the vaccine causes autism and mandates for Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ontario, only about 90 percent of residents have been vaccinated against measles — statistics suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in Gaines County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-70ca0170-ff53-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of America's latest outbreak, only about 82 percent of people have been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Reminds Everyone He’s Not a Huge Fan of Vaccines in Bonkers Fox Interview - Rolling Stone</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNcjlCa0Y4MGRpM1l4TXRQWGNwSEZtNlhGc2wwWWE0bjFlMHd4d1I4RFhRZG5DcUE2UHdScHN4QkRVeVRBQjkzdlBkMDJxNEp4VWZtR3FCOUdQT3dVXzRpelRYS093endkOFNKbnZiTVo5NTJYcEU4S1RYeTVPbVJlQ2VNMzZISzFDT2JQa19jdDdZRnVLLW5ZZEVqT2tSN0ZEVTdGN1YwUnFYdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pmc-paywall"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As a major &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreak spreads out of West Texas &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/health/measles-outbreak-texas-oklahoma-new-mexico/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;into other states&lt;/a&gt;, Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread a confusing message about vaccine safety. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Tuesday, Kennedy touted the vaccine — but also suggested that the best way to get lifetime immunity from the measles is to simply become infected with measles, and that the measles vaccine is dangerous to those who take it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It used to be — when you and I were kids — that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899636733693554878" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; from inside the Steak &amp;amp; Shake fast food restaurant where the interview was conducted. “The vaccine is effective for some people for life, for many people it wanes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1-3 of every 1,000 childhood measles infections would result in death due to respiratory or neurological complications from the highly virulent disease. Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000 after the implementation of a successful, two-dose national vaccination campaign that lasted decades. Until recently, measles cases detected in the United States nearly always originated from foreign travel.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is incredibly effective, and incredibly safe. Two doses in early childhood are 97 percent effective against measles, according to the CDC, and complications are extremely rare. However, if you ask our nation’s health secretary — a known vaccine skeptic — taking the MMR vaccine could be just as risky as catching a deadly infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes — encephalitis, blindness, et cetera,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899637162817036510" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Hannity. “So people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“One of the problems is that [the vaccine] does not appear to provide maternal immunity,” Kennedy said. “It used to be that very young kids […] they were protected by breast milk, and by maternal immunity. Women who get vaccinated do not provide that level of maternal immunity to the natural measles infection, so you’re now seeing measles hit very very young kids and hitting older people.”At one point Kennedy suggested that deaths attributed to measles in the past had been primarily caused by malnutrition and comorbidities. 

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy failed to mention that the majority of recent American measles outbreaks have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/30/increase-measles-cases-unvaccinated-vaccine-misinformation-cdc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;linked to communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination levels are dropping due to vaccine skepticism, or are below the rate needed to preserve social immunity. While breastfeeding women can temporarily pass along antibodies to their children through breast milk, the immunity benefits have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;been found to wane&lt;/a&gt; before the child reaches their first birthday, and vaccination is still recommended for long-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The health secretary noted a commitment to “encourage” people to get vaccinated, but did so as an offhand comment amid another bout of fear mongering about the dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccines/" id="auto-tag_vaccines" data-tag="vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; — which are significantly less than those of a measles infection. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy’s handling of the measles outbreak in Texas has been blasted by lawmakers and public health officials. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-handling-west-texas-measles-outbreak-1235290478/"&gt;he took a hiking trip&lt;/a&gt; to the Coachella Valley as &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hhs/" id="auto-tag_hhs" data-tag="hhs"&gt;HHS&lt;/a&gt; officials scrambled to bring the outbreak under control, and later pushed vitamin A as a way to combat the disease, despite health experts noting that vitamin A only helps when someone already has a vitamin A deficiency.. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last month, during a meeting of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Kennedy asserted that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;downplayed the severity&lt;/a&gt; of the caseload. The Texas Department of Health the very same day confirmed the first measles death in the United States in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three major US airports have already raised the alarm over measles this year, with alerts also being issued in &lt;a target="_self" class=""

target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14487651/texas-father-daughter-measles-death.html"&gt;amid a major outbreak &lt;/a&gt;of the disease in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a8a70880-ff45-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has already sickened more than 250 people and led to 29 hospitalizations and two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is spread via respiratory droplets expelled via coughs and sneezes that can hang in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infected patients first suffer from a fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat before developing the characteristic red rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, including the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After arriving on March 5, local health authorities said the patient visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood between 11am and 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether the patient was vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On March 10 the patient went to Superior Grocery Store in El Monte from 8.15am to 10.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear when the person first showed symptoms for measles or when their infection was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with the disease, however, patients are told to isolate and if symptoms become severe enough, they may be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are typically treated with painkillers, but may also receive antibiotics if they develop an associated infection or Vitamin A if they show signs of being malnourished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, they may also need assistance breathing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Muntu Davis, Los Angeles county's health officer, said: 'With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to other before they feel sick or have symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two of the airport-linked measles patients have arrived in the US on China Airlines flights this year, while one has arrived on a Korean Air flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second case in Los Angeles is in a resident, while the first case was in a foreign traveler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no reports suggesting an outbreak of measles in China or South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But late last month, officials in Ontario, Canada, also raised the alarm over measles after an infected passenger arrived in the area from South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the US, measles has not been officially eradicated in China, which records low numbers of cases every year, but it was officially eradicated in South Korea in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but cases have repeatedly emerged since — linked to passengers bringing in the virus from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over recent years, the vaccination rate against measles has dropped, however, amid Covid vaccination mandates and concerns over the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective against the virus, which can cause death or leave patients with a life-long disability in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:29:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

When Peebles and his colleague &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1954/enders/facts/"&gt;John Enders&lt;/a&gt;, in a hurry to develop a measles vaccine, learned of the outbreak at Fay, Peebles visited David and asked if he’d like to help the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUDPISFYSVGRZM3QZNVRBVRLDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David recalls giving blood samples and having his throat swabbed, as well as gargling something that tasted of sour milk. A few weeks later, Peebles returned to let David know that the samples had produced exactly what the scientists needed: the measles virus, which they planned to isolate and develop into a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DMN57ID3RFCHBR3NOSDKLXSAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor offered David a steak dinner for his troubles, but he declined: “I wasn’t too keen on steak, so I said, ‘No, thanks,’” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ERHI5QXNBAQBCJJRJBSVPKOLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took several years for the scientists to turn David’s virus sample into a vaccine and years to test its efficacy and safety, but when it finally was licensed in 1963, it was named for the boy whose illness made the advance possible: The Edmonston-B strain led to the Edmonston-Enders vaccine, a version of which is still used today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OWPFUY44JBDTVO2KUU67SITDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CBS flew David from Washington to New York to appear on TV with the scientists to celebrate the vaccine, part of an extensive public health campaign that persuaded an overwhelming majority of parents to immunize their children — leading to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;elimination of measles&lt;/a&gt; from the country in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWOAQD2JF5BBHM625Z2ISCQTPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After college and a stint in the Deep South protesting with civil rights advocates, Edmonston settled into a life remodeling homes. He’d never had much interest in science, but he married a public health teacher, and when they had a son in 1980, they decided not to vaccinate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="32V5AGO2UREWNOL37TEMG2D4QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My wife read an article that a researcher wrote, saying that the measles vaccine might give children a disease,” Edmonston said. “It was scary. My wife thought it was better not to vaccinate him. And I agreed to it: She was the mother, and had some public health training. He never did get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BG3JC7PTNNG43M7NTE4K5QMBUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Edmonston’s wife died two decades ago. He has lived for many years in a spiritual community based on Indian meditation, many of whose adherents, he says, are vaccination skeptics. Especially once the covid pandemic hit, he saw his friends “latch onto the idea that vaccines are dangerous,” he said, “and they became almost religious about it. I’ve struggled for years to understand why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F4AOGIO74VDYLODUSBXK7PFFCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As people around him turned against vaccines, he read some of the science and pivoted the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KUCJOAHHW5DWVBWPVZF5VVURHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The more I thought about it, the more I returned to my feeling for the degree of intellectual honesty of the doctors I met all those years ago — their basic integrity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXFCZ2H25BENZEBBXJBHJJKP4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His vaccine-hesitant friends “are more willing to think in intuitive ways, rather than rational thinking,” Edmonston said. “I’ve lived in both those worlds. I’m by nature a more rational person, but I’ve become more intuitive in my work with this spiritual group. I still struggle with how to persuade people who are more intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BM7VRJE3SJHJXD354WM4HVEKCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A marshaling of facts doesn’t do the trick. Statistics showing that the measles vaccine has saved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7345a4.htm"&gt;60 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in this century alone don’t persuade the resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AR3T4VYCOVCYHE4NGKRSXTDEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it doesn’t help to have authority figures such as Kennedy and Donald Trump, who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/the-measles-book-childrens-health-defense-vaccine/"&gt;spread doubt&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines even as they sometimes claim to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JK4T2I3GWJBSBPLZDP6LU7W7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Edmonston got the covid shots, he emailed his friends, urging them to protect their communities (to little effect).

Disease in Childhood. They showed that in each case the child became acutely unwell with a cluster of symptoms soon after drinking a slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The children fell ill as a result of what the study referred to as glycerol intoxication syndrome, which caused symptoms such as decreased consciousness and low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slushies maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the UK, slushies containing glycerol are not recommended for children under the age of four. The review team at University College Dublin, led by the consultant paediatrician Prof Ellen Crushell, called for health advice to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All but one of the cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments. The review team suggested drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol. It also recommends consumption be limited to no more than one slush a day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with the advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar. But one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPanZ2RWNBRFh3QUxRMEpjNVc0alZmNEV2ZmhhUUlXNnNhMnR5anhLMlIydHdhNWN3NVVWNzVrX1Q5MGJtRkhuODBKWnNua2FKaUJlX2ptUXh6cXNGR0RIZ0RVYnliU0h2MnA2UmU0VGNfd0pjcVhYamo2d2dKam1fMi1PQXFOd3VValEtVUs3Q3otUzl0ODlrVTIzWFhTdEpObXJQWmQwUTZaNkN1dVZlS0FYREtudXZTWEE</guid></item><item><title>Urgent warning over three common drugs that 'could cause sudden death' - after woman on the combination suffer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were today told to stop dishing out three common drugs given to thousands of Brits at the same time, over fears the combination could cause 'sudden death'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning follows the death of a 'beautiful, generous and caring' nurse, who died of a sudden cardiac arrest four years after starting the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chloé Burgess, from Southampton, was already taking two common antidepressants in 2019 when she was prescribed ivabradine — sold under the brand name Procoralan — to treat an abnormal heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, the dangers of this combination of drugs was not well known among health workers who treated her, a coroner has concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) sold as Elavil, is one of the three medications coroner Nicholas Walker raised the alarm over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-e06ef230-ff3d-11ef-b1e3-f16e137093de"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burgess, from Southampton, was already taking two common antidepressants in 2019 before she was prescribed ivabradine — sold under the brand name Procoralan — to treat an abnormal heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Researchers emphasize these memory-enhancing methods could significantly benefit public education and digital literacy programs, addressing misinformation challenges in health, politics, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of misinformation resistance is directly tied to how well individuals recall initial training interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Booster Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular memory-focused reminders significantly extend the duration and strength of misinformation resistance, similar to medical vaccine boosters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Text, video, and gamified methods were all effective, highlighting the broad potential for scalable anti-misinformation programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that targeted psychological interventions can significantly enhance long-term resistance to misinformation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “psychological booster shots,” these interventions improve memory retention and help individuals recognize and resist misleading information more effectively over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, explores how different approaches, including text-based messages, videos, and online games, can inoculate people against misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Potsdam and King’s College London conducted five large-scale experiments with over 11,000 participants to examine the durability of these interventions and identify ways to strengthen their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested three types of misinformation-prevention methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text-based interventions, where participants read pre-emptive messages explaining common misinformation tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video-based interventions, short educational clips that expose the emotional manipulation techniques used in misleading content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gamified interventions, an interactive game that teaches people to spot misinformation tactics by having them create their own (fictional) fake news stories in a safe, controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were then exposed to misinformation and evaluated on their ability to detect and resist it over time. The study found that while all three interventions were effective, their effects diminished quickly over time, prompting questions about their long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, providing memory-enhancing “booster” interventions, such as a follow-up reminder or reinforcement message, helped maintain misinformation resistance for a significantly longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the longevity of misinformation resistance was primarily driven by how well participants remembered the original intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up reminders or memory-enhancing exercises were also found to significantly extend the effectiveness of the initial intervention, much like medical booster vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the researchers found that boosters that did not focus on memory, but rather focused on increasing participants’ motivation to defend themselves by reminding people of the looming threat of misinformation, did not have any measurable benefits for the longevity of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr. Rakoen Maertens from the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, said: “Misinformation is a persistent global challenge, influencing everything from climate change debates to vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that just as medical booster shots enhance immunity, psychological booster shots can strengthen people’s resistance to misinformation over time. By integrating memory-boosting techniques into public education and digital literacy programs, we can help people retain these critical skills for much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol and a co-author of the study, emphasised the generality of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “It is important that the effects of the inoculation interventions were nearly the same for videos, games, and text-based material. This makes it much easier to roll out inoculation at scale and in a broad range of contexts to boost people’s skills in recognizing when they are being misled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the urgent need for scalable and more durable misinformation interventions and highlights the importance of collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and social media platforms to integrate these insights into public information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7949f859e848398879f9285d99a949e99838e8592b796939a9e99d9988fd99694d9829c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher McIntyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christopher McIntyre – University of Oxford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57205-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/a&gt;” by Rakoen Maertens et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of real-world interventions aim to preemptively protect or inoculate people against misinformation. Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPWlowcVcwLWVwNUh0Y1hidF9ici0xVWk4TUpScU45M2lGcVpPZ1dLWVhod3RqZGpRNmRUTEFiQU02aHJOUXJpd1hTUkhYRXJ3SDc1X09iYzhNVVQtbkxyQ1N5Z05zNEtyOEk1Zklla25RZlE1OTViZHR5a2RUai1iUkZn</guid></item><item><title>Rewriting Neuroscience: Possible “Foundations of Human Intelligence” Observed for the First Time - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:51:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Makes More Alarming Comments About Measles Amid U.S. Outbreaks - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxONWtDSm9XdnBYd0hJVjVGMDZEMjZvRDNKRDQxOThpd2lOV3lia1pLOEZLUlVBQzBVaWZOLTZzWmhBUDI2X0l1aDVhQWw0WURLYzE5Y3hwYWNzTW9QcUFTQWtMcUVSLXFJVHdVYUpRX21pLVk2MXBHNThRQU5CR2pnd2xOaWXSAYoBQVVfeXFMTld6dnVsaFlpWVVCcjQ4Vk01VlNMeDY0R0JBdzNxeUxvbXZocFp5T1BtWEZ4OElUaE1vbWptc2JyRlRER3p6Mkx2Wm1MR25oMVRTU3hUTV80T0dZRW95U1EtMlN4U3hFS2piUmV1WFlZUkFfcXRXeG52aUpVZ1J5R0o1WGVoM1FNMDN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

We should have informed choice. And — but if people don’t want it, the government shouldn’t force them to do it. There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has stressed the measles vaccine is safe and effective.

We should have informed choice. And — but if people don’t want it, the government shouldn’t force them to do it. There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has stressed the measles vaccine is safe and effective. Its website lists extensive information about the vaccine, including potential side effects and warnings for people who shouldn’t get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s skepticism around vaccines is well-documented.

And the drinks aren't likely to be a cause of concern when consumed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell said the children were so sick they were referred for genetic testing because the pediatricians in the emergency departments suspected a metabolic disorder. Most of them came into the emergency room unconscious, she said. One child had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Glycerol is a sugar alcohol naturally found in fats and oils that is used as a sugar replacement. Besides slushie drinks, it is sometimes added to various other foods such as protein bars and shakes, dried fruit, chewing gum, and sugar-free candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When consumed, it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and spread throughout the body's water stores. In large amounts, it can lead to excessive water retention and cause digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study suggests that young children may be more vulnerable to glycerol's effects because their smaller body size and developing metabolism make it harder for them to process and clear the compound efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Slush ice drinks have contained a lot of glycerol instead of sugar in recent years due to the increased demand for sugar-free food," Crushell explained. "To maintain the slush, you need either sugar or glycerol, but due to public health concerns and a sugar tax, sugar was reduced and glycerol was added."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should watch for any signs of drowsiness or reduced consciousness, slurring of speech, nausea, or general sickness after a child has downed a slushie drink, Crushell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If parents suspect that their child is becoming unwell, the first thing they should do is to stop them from drinking any more of the drink," she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell also recommended giving the child something sugary to eat and seeking medical attention if they have a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although this study only looked at children in the UK and Ireland, slushie drinks are also popular in the U.S., with sales of frozen drinks, including slushies, topping over $6B in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/regional-analysis/north-america-frozen-drinks-market-report" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the website Cognitive Market Research. The Food Standards Scotland and Food Standards Agency already recommends that the drinks should not be sold to children four years of age or younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell emphasized that there are many reasons to limit how many slushie ice drinks children consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The main takeaway is that slush ice drinks do not convey any health benefits to children, whether they're full of sugar or glycerol," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Heya Batah, MD is an internal medicine resident at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:21:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNVWo3Wl9QNTAwUndIZUE3TDBDUEh4OWp2ZFprcENFZE12Y2Rrc2JPQWJUaU1haGpya1F2cGZ1TzlQOTgzNkRFQnhBRVlFU1FzOEVkOTNNMWN0SFVlYXREU3VDaVNodndlWXRaaC11U3NQM2tsTHF5LTZZODBVUWZmZjh3ZGVkckxNQzNrSXRrcmdJeWJGTEZvSWZZT3BoeTg00gGmAUFVX3lxTE5TZ2NWeVp2d05NMnhKVzFReDRNeFJMVk9KN18tbjh1ckl6MDZJbVQzSUJEbjZqS2lkeHptMTBlQWtmWlRudUhnZjRYTHlTTGFvMVN5clNSQ1BPamFSUjR4RFh6UU0xZzBHU2p0ZTE3VnFUSVp0cUNEWU52dkJyTHFGX3BnZTlUMWdlM0R1NDZuRmJielp3S2hpVXlTVEdxdnNQdlNuRkE</guid></item><item><title>An urgent argument for the HPV vaccine - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPLS1XTDJ5ZTVlLUpiT1BOQTRXS3NYcTdsNUw2WmhxWWMtSW95MVp0Z2VtYnlrTkNwS2NzVlR5VE5abENCNHhqcjQwNkctOGJJbXlOQnZxT2ZHNlNWcjNmUnVONWExc3EyM3pyZnVKWWllcUZ0OHRIdF9fTTNXdzVnRXo1ZFFWTWRBN2VSNlpSVVk3dGZtSGs5bUhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Chris Riley's symptoms started in the summer of 2021. At first, he didn't think much about them. His throat felt a little sore, and he noticed hardening of his lymph nodes. At 57 years old, Riley was active and healthy. He biked everywhere and didn't even own a car.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley, it turned out, had oropharyngeal cancer, which develops in the tonsils or throat. In Riley's case, it had originated in his left tonsil, but by the time it was discovered — after visits to a dentist, a general practitioner, and an ear, nose and throat specialist — it had spread to his lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The cause, according to his doctors, was human papillomavirus, or HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV is a virus that can live and replicate in certain cells on the surface of the skin and mucous membranes, including the inner lining of the mouth, throat and genitals. While &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/hpv/types-of-hpv.html#:~:text=There%20are%20more%20than%20200,mucosal%20membranes%20or%20mucosal%20surfaces)." target="_blank"&gt;over 200 types of the virus exist&lt;/a&gt;, only a few can lead to cancer, usually many years or decades after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who isn't vaccinated against HPV will be infected at some point, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;9 out of 10 infections resolve&lt;/a&gt; within two years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Passed from person to person through skin-to-skin contact, usually during sexual activity, HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, which kills about 4,000 people in the United States every year. But the virus can also lead to warts and other malignancies, including cancer of the throat, anus and genitalia — it's linked to six types of cancers in total. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPV is responsible for approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;37,800 cases of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53252" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A safe and well-tolerated vaccine can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccines/reasons-to-get.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent about 90%&lt;/a&gt; of such cancers. But in the U.S., HPV vaccines continue to be among the most underutilized recommended vaccines, a tragedy that may worsen if Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, tries to discredit them and limit access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist who has spread false claims about the HPV vaccine, including the assertion that it can cause cancer, and has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-kennedy-health-secretary-ethics-390e47ac1dd11aeef954851a9a5358ac" target="_blank"&gt;benefited financially&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to support legal challenges against manufacturer Merck. His role gives Kennedy a powerful platform from which to further undermine vaccine acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;pledged to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; of Louisiana, a physician, that he would maintain the CDC's current vaccine safety and monitoring systems&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and back recommended vaccination schedules. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he also refused to accept decades of medical research validating the safety of vaccines. When &lt;a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-hearing-rfk-jr-refuses-to-say-hpv-vaccine-is-safe-to-sen-patty-murray-pressed-on-credible-accusation-of-sexual-assault/" target="_blank"&gt;questioned by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray&lt;/a&gt; of Washington, he declined to say whether he stands by his prior statements calling the HPV vaccine "dangerous and defective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An underutilized prevention tool&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be highly effective, HPV vaccines must be given at a young age, before the onset of sexual activity. An &lt;a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/news/2024/january/no-cervical-cancer-cases-detected-in-vaccinated-women-following-hpv-immunisation/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis from Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, where school-based programs promote universal HPV vaccination, showed no cases of cervical cancer in fully immunized women who received their first HPV shot at ages 12 or 13. In the U.S., the HPV vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a4.htm?s_cid=mm7406a4_w" target="_blank"&gt;has been credited&lt;/a&gt; with a 79% reduction in the incidence of cervical precancer in women ages 20-24.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Introduced in 2006, the HPV vaccine initially was approved only for girls and young women. Its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended use&lt;/a&gt; now includes everyone through age 26, though vaccination at ages 11 to 12 — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9980633/" target="_blank"&gt;or even earlier&lt;/a&gt; — is preferred. When the vaccine is initiated at ages 9 to 14, usually two doses are required. When the first dose is given at or after age 15, three doses are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333a1.htm?s_cid=mm7333a1_w#T2_down" target="_blank"&gt;Recent data&lt;/a&gt; indicates that only about 61% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 have completed the HPV vaccination series. Rates have stagnated in the last few years and lag far behind usage of other common adolescent immunizations to prevent meningococcal disease (88.4%) and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (89%).&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The HPV vaccine is crucial," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.venturafamilymed.org/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Carlos O'Bryan-Becerra&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician with Ventura County Medical Center in California and a 2022-23 vaccine science fellow with the American Academy of Family Physicians. He cited its ability to prevent oropharyngeal cancer and five other types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, many patients, their families, and even clinicians are unaware that HPV causes cancers beyond the cervix," O'Bryan-Becerra said. "This lack of awareness makes it even more important to promote the vaccine as a cancer prevention tool."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, most often seen in men, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132363/" target="_blank"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; rates of cervical cancer. Overall, men are 2.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with an HPV-associated malignancy and face mortality rates that are 2.8 times that of affected women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53255" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Treatment for oropharyngeal cancer can be brutal. Riley, a former Austin City Council member, started radiation and chemotherapy soon after his diagnosis. But it came with a tremendous cost. His salivary glands and taste buds were destroyed, and for months, he required a feeding tube to ensure adequate nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite frequent chocolate milkshakes, one of few foods he could still taste, he lost weight and became exhausted with even minimal activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I see people just eating normal diets and going to normal restaurants, and that will never be me again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Barriers to vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pervasive misinformation surrounding HPV and the safety and necessity of its vaccine remains an enormous hurdle for vaccine promotion. Some families assume, incorrectly, that the vaccine is only for girls or is indicated only after a young person becomes sexually active. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mistrust around immunizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains widespread. Some argue that the HPV vaccine encourages promiscuity, an allegation that has been &lt;a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/promoting-hpv-vaccine-doesn%E2%80%99t-lead-more-teen-sex-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;thoroughly debunked&lt;/a&gt;. Still others aren't convinced that HPV is a serious health threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy can occur even among medical and nursing staff, which undermines promotion efforts, says O'Bryan-Becerra.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cultural stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections contributes to such hesitancy. Many teenagers and their families feel embarrassed discussing the topic, which can deter them from seeking the vaccine. People of color, those who live in rural areas and those without private health insurance are less likely than others to be vaccinated against HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine represents a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. Yet, accurate information and access are often lacking in schools and even health clinics. Doctors and their teams need to provide clear guidance about the importance of early HPV vaccination, before a young person becomes sexually active, to provide the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without widespread proactive measures to educate and improve vaccination rates, we risk perpetuating falsehoods and health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley died last summer, after a final effort to treat his cancer with chemotherapy and immunotherapy failed. The cancer had returned about a year after his initial treatment and had spread to his liver. He had just turned 60. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the weeks before he died, he mused about HPV vaccines, which probably would have saved his life, had they been available to him as a child. He was perplexed by HPV vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just seems really strange to me that a parent would have an opportunity to protect their kid against something like what I've been through and yet would forgo that opportunity," Riley told me in our final conversation. If more parents understood the vaccine's lifesaving potential, he said, "people would be clamoring" for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthwatch.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Health Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lisadoggett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Doggett &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;is a family and lifestyle medicine physician at the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center of UT Health Austin, the clinical practice of Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Residents of west Texas “come here to shop at the big box stores – Walmart, Costco, Sam’s and so forth,” said Cook, adding that Lubbock hospitals have already treated 38 measles

vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cook described an outbreak curve, familiar to those who watched infections rise and fall during the Covid-19 pandemic, that is still on the “incline”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;His concerns are shared by other local physicians, such as Dr Philip Huang, director of the Dallas county’s department of health and human services, who told local &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-update-200-cases-spring-break/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; news affiliate: “There’s concern that

He worries that the immunocompromised and babies could be exposed to measles in doctor’s waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I personally don’t think I anticipated this, although I’m not surprised,” said Dr Tammy Camp, pediatric residency coordinator with Texas Tech University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Sciences Center, also in Lubbock. When fewer people vaccinate, she said, “you always know you’re ripe for the possibility of an outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. Doctors often use the example of a room full of people to illustrate this: if 10 unvaccinated individuals enter and one has measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=But%20measles%20can%20cause%20serious,if%20they%20are%20not%20protected." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nine leave infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC expects&lt;/a&gt; the outbreak to continue spreading and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season. Although measles was once a common childhood disease, it is not without risks and general misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The most common symptoms include a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Severe symptoms are less common but can be devastating: about one in a thousand infected children suffer severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, a condition that can lead to seizures, deafness and intellectual disability. Between one and three out of a thousand will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, scientists believe that measles infection can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections for months because it suppresses the immune system. Very rare conditions can also strike: about one in 25,000 children, or the equivalent of about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20561004/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;four each year&lt;/a&gt;, suffer a degenerative neurological condition called &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. The disease presents years after infection with dementia-like symptoms that are eventually fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20are%2097%25%20effective%20against%20measles,are%20eliminated%20from%20the%20body." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing the disease. The vaccine’s side effects, while uncomfortable, are typically transient, and include fever and rash. Rarer side effects, such as febrile seizure, are nearly 10 times less common than children dying from measles infection, according to studies cited by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html#:~:text=Two%20studies%20indicate%20that%20for,These%20symptoms%20rarely%20come%20back." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study was explicitly preliminary: Its sample size was only 42 people whose claims to have suffered long-term medical problems after vaccination were assumed to be accurate representations of their medical condition, defined by the researchers as “post vaccine syndrome,” or PVS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is early-stage and requires replication and validation,” the authors wrote. The study was conducted from late 2022 through late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body"&gt;Suppressing studies because of concerns about how they might be misused sets a dangerous precedent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Harlan Krunmholz, Yale School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the limitations acknowledged by the authors are that they couldn’t be sure that the subjects’ ailments might have stemmed from infections with COVID itself, rather than vaccination. Nor could they be sure that conditions other than COVID vaccination might have accounted for the subjects’ illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, and the fact that the study was a preprint — published online without first having been vetted via peer review — the paper has been seized upon by anti-vaccination activists and the far right as confirmation that the COVID vaccines are dangerous, despite government assurances that they’re safe and effective. It has been cited by &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1892636596538581129" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt; and Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000195-86ee-d45f-adff-96ee65030011"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misinterpretation of the study’s findings has become so widespread that some scientists have questioned whether it should have been posted at all, much less promoted via &lt;a class="link" href="https://news.yale.edu/2025/02/19/immune-markers-post-vaccination-syndrome-indicate-future-research-directions" target="_blank"&gt;a Yale publicity release &lt;/a&gt;— not merely because it fed into the politicization of scientific research but because its findings were too premature to warrant publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The consequences of putting out out a press release on a preprint — especially this poor quality study — is wildly irresponsible &amp;amp; does serious harm to scientists &amp;amp; the public alike,” virologist Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan &lt;a class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/angierasmussen.bsky.social/post/3lixixpn7ts2c" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s principal researcher, Yale’s Akiko Iwasaki, has taken to social media to debunk the flurry of misrepresentations online. After the right-wing vaccine critic Paul Thacker posted a tweet stating that the authors had posited that “millions of long COVID patients &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1892382501261172922" target="_blank"&gt;may actually be vaccine injured&lt;/a&gt;,” Iwasaki tweeted a crisp reply: “No. This is &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/VirusesImmunity/status/1892749074840850757" target="_blank"&gt;not what our study shows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that vaccine science has become poisoned with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-11/how-a-blunder-by-a-respected-medical-journal-is-fueling-an-anti-vaccine-lie"&gt;disinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-07-30/column-opposing-vaccine-mandates-trump-exposes-kids-to-disease"&gt;right-wing ideology&lt;/a&gt;. The anti-science threat only intensified when Donald Trump appointed anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/03/if-you-get-sick-its-your-fault-unless-you-got-vaccinated-in-which-case-its-the-vaccines-fault" target="_blank"&gt;a recent interview on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy responded to a burgeoning measles outbreak in West Texas — which already has brought about the first measles death of a child in the U.S. in 10 years — by promoting ineffective nostrums such as cod liver oil and steroids. He questioned the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which has been in use for more than a half-century and is known to confer &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;lifetime immunity to measles&lt;/a&gt; after two doses for the vast majority of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health, which falls under the jurisdiction of HHS, has terminated grants for research into vaccine hesitancy, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, even though the Texas measles outbreak has been attributed to low measles vaccination rates in the religious community where the outbreak began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at a Senate confirmation hearing March 5, Jay Battacharya, a Stanford professor who is Trump’s nominee to head the NIH, said he endorsed further research on the purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism, even though the link was first posited by a British study that has long been retracted and no evidence of any such link has been found despite &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism" target="_blank"&gt;decades of intensive study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement’s targeting of COVID vaccination has long been underway, even thought the vaccines were estimated by the Commonwealth Fund to have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;averted 18 million hospitalizations and 3 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in just their first two years of availability, during which 655 million doses were administered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of anti-COVID policies has led to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;laws prohibiting mass vaccinations and vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana and Texas, and a proposal mounted by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida. In eight states — Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Montana, Idaho and Washington —legislative efforts are underway to ban the mRNA COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer, the leading vaccines in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yale study’s authors defend their decision to post the preprint online even as a preliminary study of post-vaccine medical conditions. “We were aware from the outset that this is a highly politicized research topic,” co-author Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale, told me by email. “The reality is that vaccine safety — like all areas of medicine — benefits from rigorous, open research, and suppressing inquiry would be counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz added, “We were fully aware that our research could be misrepresented. That is precisely why we preprinted it — so that the full study could be read and scrutinized in context, rather than discussed based on speculation.... Suppressing studies because of concerns about how they might be misused sets a dangerous precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to the study itself, which aimed to explore what the authors termed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Their goal was to pinpoint what biological conditions might predispose some people to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some people have experienced adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines — as also happens with other shots. “Vaccines are medicines, and all medicines have side effects — even when the net benefit is large,” observes Adam Gaffney, a Harvard medical school assistant professor who has been critical of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people listed as co-authors on the Yale paper say they have experienced long-term aftereffects from COVID vaccinations. (Neither was among the subjects of the Yale study.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within an hour of receiving a COVID vaccine as a subject of an early clinical trial of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca in 2020, Brianne Dressen says she began to experience symptoms such as brain fog, neuropathy (the feeling of pain or a pins-and-needles sensation in the limbs) and food sensitivities. “I feel like I’m rolling around in cactus all the time,” she told me. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been taken off the market due to competition from vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which are more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another listed co-author, retired Southern California gastroenterologist Danice  Hertz, told me she began feeling similar reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine after it was rolled out to the public in 2021. “I walked into the facility healthy and feeling fine, and within 24 hours I became severely ill. I had severe burning in my face, tremors, twitching; I felt like I was being electrocuted.” Both say these symptoms have improved, but some haven’t fully disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both say they had trouble persuading their doctors to examine the connection between their symptoms and the shots. “It was very hard to get medical care,” Hertz says. “Nobody knew anything about these reactions. You really couldn’t get medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of finding medical treatment prompted Dressen to co-found REACT19, a tax-exempt organization that provides grants to patients and providers; Hertz is listed on its website as a research advisor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although critics have labeled REACT19 as an anti-vaccine organization, both say that’s untrue — it aims to support research into PVS. Dressen and Hertz both say they are fully vaccinated against other diseases. “We are an organization of 36,000 people, 100% vaccinated,” Dressen says. “In reality this is nothing more than a medical condition, and there should absolutely be nothing political about it. It’s been extremely abhorrent and hurtful for people suffering from chronic conditions to have their illnesses politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that leaves open the question of what the Yale study tells us. Its critics say the answer is not much. The term “post vaccination syndrome” itself is a problem, in Gaffney’s view, because it takes as a given the connection between vaccination and the symptoms. That connection needs to be proved, not assumed, he argues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By assuming the cause-and-effect relationship,” he says, “you seem to give grounding to a new medical diagnosis that may not actually be a proven cause-and-effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s especially so because the described symptoms — chronic fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, and dizziness among them — are not uncommon and often arise from other causes. Indeed, they have often been attributed to long COVID — the lasting symptoms of infection by the COVID virus itself. Not all the PVS group suffered the same symptoms, raising questions about whether PVS can be accurately defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the Yale researchers found that 26 of their PVS cohort, or about 62%, had antibodies in their system indicating that they had previously had COVID, but only 15 told the researchers that they had been infected at least once. In the control group of 22 people without symptoms, 46% had the post-infection antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other critics have argued that the sample size is simply too small to extrapolate any of the Yale findings to the population at large. Moreover, the researchers divided their samples into subgroups based on whether they had been previously infected (27 of the PVS cohort group and 11 of the control group) or uninfected (15 of the PVS sample and 11 of the control group). That arguably makes it even harder to apply the findings to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors don’t disagree that much more extensive research is needed. “This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Iwasaki told Yale’s publicity department. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.... This is far from a final answer on PVS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cautionary note may be lost on the anti-vaccine brigade that has taken the study as virtually the last word on the supposed peril of COVID vaccines. In the current partisan environment, the threat to public health from a concerted movement to undermine the public’s trust in science and vaccines is real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the Yale study sincerely see themselves as heralds of empirical science, whatever the political ramifications. “If we only published research that aligns with prevailing narratives or avoids controversy, we would be failing in our responsibility as scientists,” Krumholz told me. “Our obligation is to pursue the truth, even when it is inconvenient.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if the truth becomes not merely inconvenient, but weaponized by unscrupulous actors in a war against the public interest? Unfortunately, we may now have reached that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:00:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxONnlKekVBZ0NjaVlLQ1BHZTlzYTJmUzNzXzlfSXFXY19mek04MnJvaTl1eVRBbjMwR05zVk5PaDhRZFVqa3RsZ0ZsbHcwc2ZfYXRhSV83MFMwSWt0TXBvLWVxd0xFMXVqZWdsbXYyaVFyVExzZndjT0ljQUU0ZXZqZ3FnR0lHTktKcHNRT0xYMERMX2pVaVVoRHU5cXgzSV9zU2tXZFNteTNNaURNZUdleXNxLU5uTVR5VFpPM1ZidkwwMm5hWE9VYS04alRFWVRx</guid></item><item><title>Diagnostic dilemma: Growing weed with bat poop left 2 men with deadly infections - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPQlNQeUVOcjk5Smh5VFk2REhpQ0RtLTVzd0YxVGNZc3hCaTBPUTNSeklTczY2X0JJa29ZQ0hJQ1ZfTnpjQ21WRnQyTllELVRGU3hTdng2M3ctN1BIeWlRUm15ck1wU2pFMDNpeTJDRUVWNFJpemZWR09VaElpMGROMWRjbl9HMlcwbjFGcG5lUFd3TUZTRDN2OTlnSFBjQlljSkdiaVhRckM1SzF6c1pzYmNIYWJpY0I4TV9qRC1pWnZCT1NNNlcwWXJaZmtxWnM5Q3hMV3Vnb2o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patients: &lt;/strong&gt;A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;computed tomography&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lungs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cause of asthma lung damage revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, patient two had a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).

Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;For example, patient one had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a common type of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Microscope image of the fungus that causes histoplasmosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: CDC/Dr. Lucille K. Georg via CDC PHIL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a report describing the cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a "natural superfood" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arizona in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New York in 2022&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" target="_blank" data-url="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ohio in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Long COVID patients haven't stopped pushing for more research funding to find treatments for their condition, including this protest in Washington, D.C. in 2022.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's been five years since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. But many patients with long COVID have yet to find meaningful recovery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Around 6% of adults in the U.S. —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or roughly 18 million — are estimated to be living with the damaging aftermath of catching the virus, according to research and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank"&gt;long-running survey&lt;/a&gt; of U.S households, although numbers are still difficult to pin down because the definitions vary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not a thing of the past — new patients are still showing up in doctor's offices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions," says &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/covid19-patient-led-research-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Davis,&lt;/a&gt; co-founder of the advocacy group, Patient-Led Research Collaborative,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've seen so much long COVID in just the last year or two."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research on long COVID has coalesced around a handful of explanations for what could underpin the illness, but that hasn't yet translated into major breakthroughs for patients who need care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are still no approved treatments for the condition, which can span many organ systems and symptoms depending on the patient, and can include shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue and post-exertional malaise, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, long COVID patients had pushed &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5199994/long-covid-patients-nih-research-treatments" target="_blank"&gt;for more federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and a refocus of research priorities toward treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, patient advocates and scientists have to make their case to new decision-makers, guided by the priorities of the Trump administration — and do so at a moment of turbulence for biomedical sciences with funding imperiled for many institutions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Regardless of party or political position, long COVID patients have been failed to date by our leaders," says &lt;a href="https://x.com/meighanstone?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;Meighan Stone&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, who's busy lobbying the new administration and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone acknowledges there are certainly some "heartfelt disagreements," between the patient community and Trump's picks to lead federal health agencies, particularly on policies related to curbing the spread of the virus, but she argues patients need to find places where there's common ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don't have the luxury of sitting out the next four years over any ideological differences.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Slow progress in research, but promising new trials &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many patients, the day-to-day reality has not changed dramatically. Finding clinicians who are well-versed in the nuances of long COVID remains challenging, patients say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach to care generally focuses on relieving specific symptoms and related medical conditions that someone develops such as autoimmunity or POTS, says &lt;a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/gutierrezm19" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez,&lt;/a&gt; chair of rehabilitation medicine at UT Health Science Center San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It is a lot of symptom management right now," she says. "We need significant treatment trials so patients have the possibility of getting a cure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though progress has not come nearly fast enough, those involved in long COVID research emphasize there's reason for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, Davis notes scientists have published important work&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07873-4" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;in a variety of areas — on blood clotting, the impacts of exercise, evidence of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk3295" target="_blank"&gt;viral persistence&lt;/a&gt; in the spinal cord, and loss of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036752" target="_blank"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the brain, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With this research in hand, the field is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;now ripe&lt;/a&gt; for a broader push to test different therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When trials launched a couple of years ago, there was hope that it would be easy and we would just hit a home run," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/michael.peluso" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Michael Peluso&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a large research program on long COVID at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first round of trials that have been reported out have shown this is going to be more complicated — we all sort of expected that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By Peluso's estimation, there are currently in the neighborhood of 50 drug trials underway for long COVID, a considerable increase from a few years ago when he only counted about a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have drugs that can target almost every single one of the different mechanisms that we think might be contributing to long COVID, but so far we've launched way too few trials" to thoroughly test them, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To get there will require more participation from drugmakers, which have largely stayed on the sidelines. Plus, researchers want to identify a biomarker for the illness that can be reliably tracked across multiple trials; and they say a better coordinated clinical trial agenda is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Different theories on long COVID's cause&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Viral persistence — the theory that an ongoing infection is hiding out in the body — has featured prominently in some of the early trials, which have leveraged antivirals and monoclonal antibodies in hopes of extinguishing an ongoing infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At least half a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; may also drive the illness, though.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among them: Immune dysfunction, the reactivation of dormant viruses like herpes, dysregulation of clotting proteins, and trouble with the microbiome. All of these could be equally, if not more important as viral persistence, and have received less attention in clinical trials up to this point, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Davis is closely following a number of up-and-running trials, led by individual research groups and universities, which are testing immunomodulators, HIV drugs, rapamycin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), enzymes called nattokinase and lumbrokinase, and other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Private funders &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1229724579/scientists-rely-on-private-funding-to-push-long-covid-research-forward" target="_blank"&gt;have stepped&lt;/a&gt; up to back some of these efforts. For example, the non-profit PolyBio Research Foundation has raised millions of dollars to spearhead &lt;a href="https://polybio.org/consortium-project-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;some of its trials&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government, however, remains pivotal in guiding the broader long COVID agenda, given its role in funding research and eventually greenlighting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Through the RECOVER initiative, Congress has already poured more than $1 billion into this work and last year appropriated an &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/nih-adds-funds-long-covid-research-advances-work-new-clinical-trials" target="_blank"&gt;additional $662 million&lt;/a&gt; to be spent in the coming years. About half of that money is supposed to support clinical trials, led by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new lobbying push from patients&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring these studies — and the funding for them — continue is the number one priority right now, says Stone of the Long COVID campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With upheaval across federal health agencies and science funding in doubt, it's hard to know what's in store for an emerging field of research like long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;It's going to take a different type of strategy than we have been doing for the last four years," says Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/05/g-s1-51401/nih-director-bhattacharya-nominee" target="_blank"&gt;the nominee to lead the NIH,&lt;/a&gt; both explicitly pledged to support long COVID research during their Senate confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone says Kennedy's focus on chronic diseases — and specifically the president's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again Commission&lt;/a&gt; — could be an opportunity for long COVID patients and those suffering from infection-associated chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Kennedy has indicated he'd like to deprioritize research on infectious diseases and even petitioned to have federal regulators pull the COVID-19 vaccine off the market in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy and Bhattacharya have also heavily criticized measures aimed at mitigating COVID transmission. But many in the long COVID community &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Letter-to-President-Biden-on-Long-COVID-Funding.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;are frustrated&lt;/a&gt; that the ongoing spread of the virus has been normalized and point out that reinfections still carry a risk for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After taking office, President Trump was quick to disband a long COVID advisory committee that took months to stand-up. That came as a disappointment to Verduzco-Gutierrez, who was a member. But she says it doesn't stop any of the work that she and others on the committee will be doing, alongside advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone managed to get a moment in the hallway with Bhattacharya after his confirmation hearing earlier this month and says he reiterated to her that he's serious about long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Patients should take Secretary Kennedy and take Dr. Bhattacharya at their word, and if the administration doesn't meet the patient community in that, then we will keep calling for action the same way that we did under President Biden," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

Should we start to consider a life without these delicious sources of fat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the most recent stories come from a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="published in JAMA" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; which looks at butter and plant based oils intake and mortality.

about symptoms, diagnosis and treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A second reason behind the rise in prescriptions could be the "strong association between the impact of the (Covid) pandemic and the worsening of ADHD symptoms," researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study, which was published in the journal BMJ Mental Health, calculated that prescriptions in England "increased significantly" from 25.17 items per 1,000 population in 2019/20 (before Covid) to 41.55 items in 2023/24, with an average annual increase of 18% nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;English prescribing data was used for the five currently licensed ADHD drugs at national, regional, and NHS integrated care board (ICB) levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Those drugs are the stimulants methylphenidate - such as Ritalin, Concerta and Delmosart - dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine and two non-stimulants - atomoxetine and guanfacine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Regional variations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study found that methylphenidate remained the most-prescribed medication while lisdexamfetamine showed the highest growth rate (55% annually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It said there was an upwards trend, but there were variations across the regions with "an average yearly increase ranging from 13% in the North East and Yorkshire region to 28% in the London region". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The experts said use of ADHD medicines in children and adults was supported by "substantial evidence", including that they improved quality of life and ability, and cut substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People with ADHD are known to suffer inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and may struggle to concentrate on a given task, or suffer extreme fidgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Ulrich Muller-Sedgwick, ADHD champion at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said people with the condition need access to timely and effective assessment, "followed by the appropriate treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The right diagnosis and care, including medication and reasonable adjustments, can greatly benefit people's health and support them to reach their full potential at school, university or work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We know that expanding ADHD services through targeted investment would help ensure people receive the vital care they need," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

the Royal College of GPs, said: "Prescribing and de-prescribing are both included in the GP curriculum which all GP registrars (trainees) must demonstrate a competence of in order to practise independently as a GP in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Restless leg syndrome will specifically be included in the updated GP curriculum, due to take effect from August 2025," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

action against his GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the first case like this which she settled was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My hope is that these cases will shine a light on the issue and patient safety will improve as a result," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he was not aware how much he had spent until he went through his accounts with Ms Vaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I just cried my eyes out, I just could not believe what I had done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Despite receiving a financial settlement, Mr Stevens said he was still living with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"All I ever wanted was an apology but I'm never going to get that apology, so I'll never get rid of the guilt," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

	&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles continues to spread in West Texas and New Mexico, with more than 250 people infected — many unvaccinated school-age children. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Two cases in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, for which state officials have not provided a location, have also been linked to these outbreaks. Eleven other states have reported isolated measles cases, typically linked to  international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Measles cases by county in 2025&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Isolated cases   &lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Outbreaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: State health departments; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Note: Reported measles cases as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in late January,  when local health officials reported two cases in Gaines County, a rural agricultural area on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The outbreak quickly escalated. Measles has spread into neighboring counties and infected at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; as of Tuesday, including 29 people who have been hospitalized and an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;unvaccinated young child who died&lt;/a&gt;, the first such death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;New Mexico also &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;declared an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. While the cases in New Mexico have not officially been connected to the Texas outbreak, officials have said they are “undoubtedly related.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz "&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Reported measles cases for Texas and New Mexico counties as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Last week, an unvaccinated resident of Lea County who &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/health/measles-death-new-mexico.html"&gt;tested positive for the virus died&lt;/a&gt;, though officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In both states, most measles cases have spread among people who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For years, Gaines County has had low childhood vaccination rates, largely because of the area’s large Mennonite community. While there is no religious doctrine that explicitly forbids vaccines, the insular Christian group has historically avoided interacting with the health care system and has a long tradition of using home remedies and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Roughly 82 percent of the kindergarten students in the county had received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, or M.M.R., last year, which is far below the 95 percent coverage needed to prevent outbreaks in a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Texas public schools require children to have received certain vaccines, including the M.M.R. shot, but parents can apply for an exemption for “reasons of conscience,” including religious beliefs. Last year, Gaines County had one of the highest exemption rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Vaccination rates can vary widely by school district. The Loop Independent School District in Gaines County is a small district with one school and the lowest rate of measles vaccination in the affected Texas counties. Only 46 percent of kindergarten students had received their M.M.R. vaccine in the 2023 school year, down from 82 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Change in measles vaccination rates in affected Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;By county, for public school districts and private schools, since 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Chart shows the change in reported vaccination rates among kindergarten students in public school districts and private schools from 2019–20 to 2023–24. Homeschooled children are not included in this data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In Lea County, N.M., the M.M.R. vaccination rate for children and teens is relatively high, at about 94 percent. But the rate among adults is much lower: 63 percent have received one shot of M.M.R., and only 55 percent have received both shots, according to local health officials, though they noted that there may be vaccinated adults whose records have not been added to the system. Adults make up more than half of reported cases in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known infections. In a hypothetical community where nobody had immunity from the virus and each infected person infected 18 others, a small outbreak would quickly grow out of control:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Every vaccinated person would help slow the spread of the virus and limit the outbreak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For the outbreak to end quickly, each infected person would need to infect fewer than one other person, on average. In this example, 17 of 18 people would need to be vaccinated — more than 94 percent of the community:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;And while measles symptoms often resolve on their own within a few weeks, the virus can be extremely dangerous in rare cases. It may cause pneumonia, making it difficult for children to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The virus also causes “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” making the body unable to defend itself against illnesses it has already been exposed to and leaving patients more susceptible to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Once someone is infected with the virus, doctors have little control over how serious a measles infection becomes — there is no antiviral for measles to stop its spread in the body, only “supportive care” to help manage symptoms. That’s why experts recommend that people get two doses of the M.M.R. vaccine, which are 97 percent effective at preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles was officially declared eliminated — which means the virus is not continually spreading — in 2000, in large part because of aggressive vaccination campaigns. Experts now fear that status may be at risk, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;childhood vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; have been falling nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A D.C.-area pediatrician is warning about the dangers of so called “measles parties” that are being held to build children’s immunity to the virus. This comes as an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/03/measles-cases-are-still-rising-in-texas-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-contagious-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cases has been seen across the country, including Texas,&lt;/a&gt; among children and adults not vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people forget we had a child recently die in 2025 of measles,” said Dr. Gabrina Dixon, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital. “I always say prevention is key. You don’t want to get the illness, you want to prevent it. And the way to prevent it is with vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no instances of “measles parties” have been reported around the D.C. region, Texas, which is seeing most of the cases, has warned against the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles cases were considered eradicated in the year 2000 due to the use of vaccinations. Now, the number of vaccinated kindergartners has dropped below &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;95% and decreasing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to believe what people say, but numbers do not lie, and we see that in communities where there are really low vaccination rates, people are getting measles,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One belief behind exposing a child to others with an illness to build their immunity could be the belief by some that a vaccine can also give someone an illness. Dixon said that is “a false narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone comes down with an illness shortly after receiving a vaccine, Dixon said it is most likely due to them catching the illness before the vaccine can fully kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes vaccines usually up to two weeks for your body to build a defense, to fight whatever the vaccine is trying to prevent,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it’s especially concerning to expose young children whose parents may not know their child’s full health picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can lead to the death of that child because they’re immunocompromised or a really severe illness causing them to be hospitalized,” she said. “The only party we should be doing is getting the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the D.C. region have warned about one case of measles in Maryland, which involved someone who &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/measles-case-confirmed-in-howard-co-resident-who-passed-through-dulles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveled through Dulles International Airport,&lt;/a&gt; presenting a risk of possible exposure to others around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of measles, according to Dixon, are cold-like in the beginning — a high fever, runny nose, cough, watery eyes — then a telltale rash will appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dixon encourages individuals to get vaccinated against measles, if they haven’t been already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood work can be used to determine if someone is protected if they are unsure whether they were vaccinated as children. For adults, anyone who was vaccinated before 1968 may need a measles booster, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a key part of reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke and other serious health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a heart-healthy diet and exercise may come to mind, which isn’t wrong. But it’s not just about what you do by day. Your nighttime routine plays a bigger role in your heart health than you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s right! Getting ready for bed might feel like an ordinary part of your day, but did you know certain bedtime steps may be powerful medicine for better blood pressure? We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/mary-branch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Branch, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, about how to make the most of those precious pre-sleep moments to support healthy blood pressure. And trust us, it’s easier than you’d expect (no burpees required!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you hit the pillow tonight, try these five simple yet effective tips to give your blood pressure a little extra love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Limit Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, unwinding at the end of the day might include sipping on a boozy nightcap. However, if you have high blood pressure, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol &lt;/a&gt;is especially important, says Branch. “For women, it is recommended to drink no more than one drink per day, and two for men,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While alcohol may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually make it harder to manage your blood pressure over time. Even small amounts can interfere with medications or put additional strain on your heart and blood vessels. And the more you drink, the higher your blood pressure rises. The link is so strong that one study found that each additional daily drink a person had significantly increased their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? By swapping that nightcap for something like herbal tea, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067374/chamomile-tea-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sticking to water, you’re doing your body a huge favor. In addition to helping promote more stable blood pressure, you’ll give your body a hydration boost, too. Just go for caffeine-free beverage options, as caffeine may make it hard to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-remember-your-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Remember Your Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prescribed medications to treat hypertension, it is recommended that you take these medications each day,” says Branch. This includes medications you may need to take before bed. Yes, even on nights when you feel too tired to open a pill bottle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adhering to prescribed hypertension medications is crucial for effectively managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of serious health complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, as these medications work best when maintained at steady levels in your system. Skipping a dose can disrupt this balance and potentially hinder progress. Incorporating daily reminders, such as setting an alarm or using a pill organizer, can help ensure you take your medications on time. Simple steps like keeping your medications within reach, like near your bedside or in a spot you frequent, can make it easier to stay on track—even on those long days when opening a pill bottle feels like a chore.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Branch suggests that practicing meditation and mindfulness may be a helpful bedtime habit for healthy blood pressure. “This can help bring down your stress level and your blood pressure along with it,” she says. “Furthermore, it can help you with getting a good night’s rest, which is also important for reducing blood pressure.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientific data supports these recommendations. Research highlights the link between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051058/does-stress-cause-high-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress and higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating the importance of addressing stress for overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By taking small but intentional steps toward relaxation before bed, you can set yourself up for restful sleep and a healthier tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some additional ways to manage stress before bed include practicing yoga or gentle stretching to ease muscle tension, journaling to clear your mind, and creating a calming bedtime environment by reducing noise and dimming lights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Establishing a consistent bedtime routine can further signal to your body that it’s time to wind down, creating a seamless transition to restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-avoid-high-sodium-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Avoid High-Sodium Snacks  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking can be tempting. But if you’re aiming to support healthy blood pressure, it’s crucial to steer clear of high-sodium foods before bed. Consuming salty snacks like chips, canned soups or pretzels may cause your body to retain water. This can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8700143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium &lt;/a&gt;intake in check, especially before sleep, may help stabilize your blood pressure overnight and promote better overall cardiovascular health. Opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-snacks-dietitians-love-8775716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-sodium snacks &lt;/a&gt;like fresh fruit, unsalted nuts or air-popped popcorn. They’ll satisfy your evening cravings without compromising your blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;

Keep Your Bedroom Cool, Dark and Comfortable  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creating the right sleep environment can have a surprising impact on healthy blood pressure levels. A cool, dark, comfortable bedroom not only promotes better sleep but also may support heart health by encouraging quality sleep. Conversely, data suggests that poor sleep can lead to elevated blood pressure over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To keep your bedroom comfortable, ensure your room is dark, quiet and cool.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eliminating distractions such as bright lights or loud noises and investing in a supportive mattress and pillow may also encourage deeper, more restorative sleep. These small adjustments may help your body relax and recover from the day, contributing to better blood pressure regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain healthy bedtime habits can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. And developing these habits doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or complicated. Simple strategies like limiting alcohol, taking your blood pressure medication, practicing mindfulness, avoiding high-sodium snacks and creating a comfortable sleep environment can all help promote better blood pressure. In addition to tried-and-true methods for supporting blood pressure, like exercise and a healthy diet, these easy, proactive steps can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Remember, the path to better well-being often starts with small, intentional changes. By prioritizing these pre-sleep practices, you’ll not only support your blood pressure but also enhance your overall quality of life, one restful night at a time.&lt;br&gt;

"As this investigation is ongoing, potential other exposures are also being assessed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's first two measles cases this year have been in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was unvaccinated but did not attend daycare or school while infectious, according to the Suffolk County Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials said the child had recently traveled "outside of the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials declined to give the age of the infected child, other than to say they were under 5. Since children generally receive their first measles vaccination between the age of 12 and 15 months, babies are usually unvaccinated for their first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, a child under 5 from Nassau County was also treated at Cohen's for measles. It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the most recent Long Island measles cases were in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new Suffolk case has not been linked to measles outbreaks elsewhere in the United States, the health department said. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, where 223 people have tested positive for measles, including one school-aged child who died from the disease. That child had not received a measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen Children’s Medical Center is working with health officials "under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident," according to a hospital statement emailed to Newsday on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles can be very serious. It’s much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization," New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement. "The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can live up to 2 hours in the air even after an infected person leaves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, such as high fever, cough and red eyes start 7 to 14 days after a person is infected, followed by a distinctive red rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One dose of the measles vaccine, which is given between 12 and 15 months, gives you about 93% protection," said Dr. Matthew Harris, who works in emergency medicine at Cohen Children's Medical Center. "The second dose, which is given between 4 and 6 years, gets it up to about 97%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said a very small percentage of children who are fully vaccinated get measles and if they do it is a much more mild form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no treatment for measles, the best we can offer is supportive care," Harris said. "It can cause a devastating pneumonia, it can cause a form of encephalitis that is irreversible and we also know that measles has longstanding impact on your immune system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told NewsdayTV Tuesday: "Measles was nearly eradicated in the early 2000s. The emergence of measles here in New York and in many states around the country is highly concerning because there are many children who are at extraordinarily high risk for complications of measles, namely those under the age of 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, about three to four million Americans were infected with measles every year, 400 to 500 people died and 48,000 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With David Olson and AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Lisa L.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheese can help you feel more satisfied on a reduced calorie diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mozzarella, swiss, ricotta and cottage cheese are higher in protein, and feta can be used in smaller amounts thanks to its strong flavor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being mindful of the protein, fat and calorie content can help you select a cheese that supports your weight loss efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is unlikely to be the first food to come to mind when it comes to weight loss. Because of its calorie density, recommended portion sizes are often small, making it feel like a food that doesn’t deserve a spot on your plate. The good news? This isn’t true. In fact, not only can cheese be included in a diet for weight loss, but it can be beneficial to do so too! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is a source of important nutrients, including protein, which helps you feel full after meals, and minerals, like calcium and phosphorus. “Plus, cheese adds flavor to meals, so you don’t feel deprived while cutting calories,” says&lt;a href="https://kelseyandcooperskitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Kelsey Sackmann, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. The key is learning which cheeses to choose and how to incorporate them into your eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-cheeses-to-eat-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Best Cheeses to Eat for Weight Loss  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Any cheese can fit into a diet plan that’s customized to meet your needs. That said, five types of cheese stand out for being particularly helpful if you’re trying to lose weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to its high protein content, dietitians commonly recommend cottage cheese for people trying to lose weight. “A 1-cup serving of low-fat (1%) cottage cheese provides approximately 28 grams of protein,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionbymandy.com/about-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Mandy Tyler M.Ed., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. That’s well above the amount found in most other cheeses making it a good choice if you’re looking to boost your protein intake. Protein helps keep you full for longer and is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, a key component to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “In addition, cottage cheese contains calcium and phosphorus, important nutrients for strong bones,” says Tyler. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many ways to include cottage cheese in your diet. You can add it to baked goods or pancake batter, incorporate it into casseroles, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-toast-recipe-8642140" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spread it over toast&lt;/a&gt; or enjoy it in a bowl with sweet or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/savory-cottage-cheese-bowl-8763804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;savory toppings&lt;/a&gt;. “I suggest pairing cottage cheese with fresh berries for a nutrient rich, satisfying afternoon snack,” says Tyler.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Mozzarella Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mozzarella cheese is a semi-soft cheese commonly made from cow’s or buffalo’s milk. It’s a good choice for weight loss because it’s relatively low in calories compared to other cheeses with a similar amount of protein. One ounce of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937030/is-mozzarella-cheese-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; mozzarella&lt;/a&gt; contains 6 grams of protein and just 85 calories, whereas the same amount of mild cheddar has 7 grams of protein and 110 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you're on a weight loss journey and are trying to watch your intake of fats, you can even opt for reduced-fat or fat-free mozzarella cheeses,” says&lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Kolesa MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Mozzarella is most commonly used in Italian cuisine, like pasta and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17976/main-dishes/pizza/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt;, but it pairs just as well with crackers and fruit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Feta Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feta cheese is a soft cheese traditionally made from sheep’s or goat’s milk. It’s a staple in Greek cuisine but has a range of culinary uses. One ounce of feta contains 75 calories, 6 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similar to other cheeses, feta is a good source of calcium, a nutrient that benefits bone health. “Feta cheese can be a good choice for individuals looking to lose weight, as it is lower in both calories and fat than many other cheese varieties,” says Tyler.  “In addition, feta cheese has a strong flavor, thus a small amount can be used to enhance the overall flavor of the meal.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swiss cheese is a hard cheese made from cow’s milk. It has a strong flavor and unique appearance, often containing holes of various sizes. One ounce of swiss cheese has 111 calories, 9 grams of fat and 8 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its slightly higher protein content makes it a good choice for weight loss as it may be more filling than cheeses with less protein per ounce.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ricotta cheese is actually not a cheese at all. Instead, it’s made from whey, a byproduct of the cheese making process. From a culinary standpoint, ricotta is treated as a cheese and can be enjoyed similarly to other soft cheeses, like cottage cheese or mascarpone. Ricotta cheese is typically made from cow’s or goat’s milk and is a good source of protein. One ½-cup serving of whole milk ricotta contains 186 calories, 13 grams of fat and 9 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Choose a higher-protein cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All cheese contains protein, but some contain higher amounts than others. For example, cottage cheese is a significant source of protein and can be used as the primary protein source in a meal or snack. Other cheeses, like feta and mozzarella, contribute protein to a meal but are unlikely to offer enough as a standalone source. Cheeses that are high in protein can help with satiety, meaning you’ll stay full longer. This is especially helpful if you’re following a reduced calorie diet. “Protein digests at a slower rate, helping us feel fuller for longer and less likely to overeat later in the day,” says Kolesa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Be mindful of fat content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is naturally high in fat, though some cheeses are available in low- or non-fat varieties. While higher fat foods are often higher in calories, it should be noted that dietary fat intake is essential for nutrient absorption and satiety. If you’re trying to lose weight, Tyler recommends being mindful of portion sizes and considering low-fat options to help stay within your daily calorie goal.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Limit highly processed cheeses &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on ultra-processed foods may benefit weight loss—including highly processed cheeses. “There’s no need to blacklist any cheese, but some—like processed cheeses and high fat, creamy varieties—pack in extra calories, additives and fewer nutrients,” says Sackmann. Examples of ultra-processed cheeses include “spray canned cheeses, cream cheese and American cheese,” says Kolesa. “These cheese types [may] contain added sugars and sodium, which can make it harder to lose weight and [may] increase the risk of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Enjoy cheese with fiber-rich or protein-rich foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From a nutritional and weight loss perspective, cheese is best when paired with high-fiber or high-protein foods. “If weight loss is the goal, stick to portions sizes, add fiber to it and use it as a vehicle for flavor,” says Sackmann. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans are high in fiber and can be easily combined with cheese for a more balanced meal or snack. You can try this combination in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8078448/cottage-cheese-snack-jar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar&lt;/a&gt;, which provides 20 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber to help keep you full until your next meal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cheese is considered a calorie-dense food, it can certainly have a place in a weight loss eating pattern. Cheeses like mozzarella, swiss, ricotta and cottage cheese are higher in protein, helping you feel full for longer, while feta cheese can be used in smaller amounts thanks to its strong flavor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to providing protein, including cheese in your diet can also help make your meals more satisfying. “Many people enjoy cheese [for] both the flavors and the creamy texture, so finding ways to include it in your eating plan when trying to lose weight could help you stick to that eating plan much better than [if you try] banning cheese [altogether],” says&lt;a href="https://heidimcindoord.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Heidi McIndoo, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. By being mindful of protein, fat and calorie content, you’ll find that it’s possible to lose weight while enjoying all the benefits cheese has to offer

While &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-probiotics/" target="_self"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt; can help maintain this balance, you can also get a natural boost from everyday foods, which can help save money while also supporting your digestive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"Probiotics are live microorganisms, often called 'good bacteria,' that help maintain a healthy balance in your gut by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing harmful ones," says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsgillean/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Gillean Barkyoumb&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and nutrition expert at &lt;a href="https://plexusworldwide.com/?culture=en-US" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Plexus Worldwide&lt;/a&gt; (which sells dietary supplements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probiotics are commonly found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir and sauerkraut, as well as in dietary supplements," she adds.

In addition to these foods, you might also try &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-probiotics/" target="_self"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;. Look for labeling that reads, "contains live cultures" or "contains active cultures" in these common probiotic foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A staple probiotic food, go for yogurt with live and active cultures. Some yogurts are specifically marketed for their probiotic content or to help improve digestion. Yogurt usually has &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;L. acidophilus bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which can promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut. Yogurt is a great option because it's widely available, comes in a variety of flavors to suit your taste and can be eaten straight from the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Kimchi&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made by fermenting vegetables with probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Kimchi can give you that probiotic punch, and it's made with healthy ingredients like vegetables (most commonly Napa cabbage, carrots, scallions and radish), garlic, red pepper powder, ginger and other spices. It makes a wonderful side and is traditionally served with steamed rice. Kimchi is associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456350/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;research regarding&lt;/a&gt; anti-cancer, anti-obesity, colorectal health, cholesterol reduction, anti-aging, brain health, immune health and skin health properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Pickles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to learn that &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;pickles&lt;/a&gt; can contain probiotics. You just have to make sure you buy fermented pickles, which are usually found in the refrigerated section of the health food aisle. Some brands even advertise probiotic content. They trend under the term "healthy pickles," but be sure to read the labels to ensure they contain probiotics. You can even make them at home. Some people also drink or use the juice the pickles are fermented in. Note that jarred pickles tend to be high in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Sourdough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourdough starter contains lactic acid bacteria. The starter is the environment where yeast and good bacteria grow by consuming water and flour. Natural prebiotics and probiotics are listed in research as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8306212/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;one of the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of sourdough bread. It's also linked to better blood glucose control, reduced cholesterol, a lower risk of diabetes, reduced cardiovascular disease risk and improved weight control. Also, it makes a pretty good sandwich bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Kefir&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir is a fermented milk made using kefir grain. It starts as a normal cow's or goat's milk, and then a grain-like yeast and lactic acid bacterial colony called kefir is added to the milk. The mixture is left to ferment for around a day and then the milk is filtered from the grains, creating the kefir drink. The resulting drink is a &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-health-benefits-of-kefir#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;powerful probiotic&lt;/a&gt; that actually packs more probiotics than yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Kombucha&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kombucha is "a go-to for fermented botanicals," Barkyoumb says. "This magic potion has been dubbed the 'immortal health elixir' because of its ability to support whole-body health and wellness while preventing illnesses. High-quality kombucha is filled with probiotics and amino acids that will help your body digest sugar, and is also a great natural hangover cure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drink is actually a fermented tea, so you're getting the health benefits of tea with the probiotic boost of a fermented beverage. It's made by adding strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to either black or green tea, which leads to the drink's probiotic-happy environment. It ferments for about a week or more until it grows a mushroom-type texture on top. The mushroom gets filtered out to make new kombucha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This German comfort food is fermented cabbage made by lacto-fermenting the vegetable in its brine with salt. As part of the traditional fermentation process, probiotics are in &lt;a href="https://ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/262#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/262%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22probiotics%22}" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;the end product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is another product where you have to specifically buy probiotic sauerkraut or make your own. Many brands use vinegar and sugar or are pasteurized, which reduces the growth of bacteria and kills probiotics. Common canned sauerkraut is usually made with vinegar or it's pasteurized (or both).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Miso soup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Japanese food is served as a side to many meals. Miso is a paste typically made from fermented soybeans and works as a condiment to make sauces, spreads and soup stock. Miso soup uses this paste for the stock. Because miso is a fermented food, it packs &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(16)33413-8/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;the probiotic punch&lt;/a&gt;. Miso soup works great with larger meals but it also makes a nice, light lunch on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple cider vinegar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is twice-fermented apple juice. Apple cider vinegar has been making its rounds for years as a popular health supplement. It has natural probiotics from the fermentation process. Though its benefits &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;need further research&lt;/a&gt;, many people also use it for everything from calming acid reflux to weight loss. It has a strong flavor, so if you don't like taking it directly, add it to salad dressing, marinades or pickling liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Some cheese&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain types of cheese have probiotics. For instance, aged cheeses &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;that are not heated&lt;/a&gt; afterward tend to have probiotics. Examples include Swiss, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, cottage cheese and provolone. The good news is that many popular cheese types have probiotics, including a healthy bowl of cottage cheese topped with fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Pickled vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines as the kimchi and pickles above, you can also look for any pickled vegetables that specifically list having probiotics. One idea is to look into lacto-fermented escabeche, a pickled dish from Mexico that can contain a wide variety of vegetables. Or you can make a fermented giardiniera, an Italian pickle relish. Using fermented pickled vegetables is also a great way to shop locally and preserve vegetables for use out of season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Buttermilk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttermilk may seem like a drink out of "Little House on the Prairie," but traditional buttermilk can be an excellent source of probiotics. Buttermilk covers different types of fermented dairy beverages, but traditional buttermilk is the liquid skimmed out of the butter-making process. The trick is to avoid cultured buttermilk, which is the most common type in supermarkets and usually does not have probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOMjJ0SktEOU1PMVZvMkRyQV9zXzdOTEVSZ3ZZa0NiM3cwMWdKRDhjb0lkdFd4SGFUUDM0am5hUjZWZmhtdDd6YzdpY1pfUXl3eU5HSnYtb0h6ZTM1QUNZb255SXREMXcyeWR0N0lNSXFJQW9fcmNtSW9LMXMtMTlOY0FHTWtfeWVIRjBicGlGUEd6OEVZRWFuYWxrQUxxaDM1dV8wa01n</guid></item><item><title>Measles at LAX: L.A.

County Department of Public Health announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a viral infection that spreads through the air and via droplets. It can potentially lead to serious health complications, including death. The virus can spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, or a person can contract it by touching an infected surface, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt;John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says, you can get measles just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second recent case of a measles-infected person exposing others at LAX. Last month, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-los-angeles-county-since-2015-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;infected infant&lt;/a&gt; returning home to Orange County arrived at the airport on a Korean Air flight in Terminal B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials listed the following locations the infected person visited after their flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are at risk of exposure to the recent measles case include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travelers who were at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX the evening of March 5 between 7 and 10:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood on March 7 between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. The salon is at 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customers of Superior Grocers at 10683 Valley Blvd. in El Monte who visited on March 10 between 8:15 and 10:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;California now has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;five reported cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; as of March 11 amid an expanding measles outbreak in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 222 cases across the nation in states that include Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All measles cases diagnosed in California thus far were of infected people who traveled internationally, the county health department stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 17% of cases nationwide have required hospitalization for management of measles complications or for the purpose of isolation, and two people have died from complications of the disease; most of the cases have been among individuals who were not immunized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-do-if-youve-been-exposed-to-measles" class="subhead"&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal, nail salon or grocery store where the infected traveler visited, you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. If you have not had measles in the past or have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or haven’t been immunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms, specifically a fever or unexpected rash from seven to 21 days after the potential exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-it-takes-for-measles-symptoms-to-appear" class="subhead"&gt;How long it takes for measles symptoms to appear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can develop from seven to 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-symptoms-of-measles" class="subhead"&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between seven and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From seven to 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash should last for five or six days before fading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and, potentially, brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infection, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s most common for complications to occur in children younger than 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 22:55:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPUGVIMXBRNlA1UDlPOGNYVGpYdDBmbFR6UngyTW9tOW9kbkF2OGxPWFdhWVFHVGNqaEh6NzVKX1lIaG5rTEZMaEVoTE1hMmNUdmlfdTR1WVhHLVpLV2ppdzByeFNSTnE3OVhkaFU0aDM4RVJNcUU4RzR1R3pWUklNNXpTekxWOFFBMC1kTWJBQ2RUdmJnQUtONDRhamh4Z0RBanpjekN0REFhdw</guid></item><item><title>West Texas measles outbreak spreads into Oklahoma - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNbG0xbUZfNWYyZzZZVTB4eHpvUTY0UkdpSnVUXzBRM2xDMGhlcE5FOU56NGlZWWJ3dzBMX2xWeWRpdXZkY0FxdXZkbEp6c3hHQXpXZDFHbXYxeldLUnZ1aWRDVkR6VDVLSU9JV3RuVXlXVUlYWmpCLXZZQjFwYWtUTVhSSDI2QjczaVRlZDAxbTB1MTFJY2hncTJwUVRlOTTSAVZBVV95cUxNajc2ZEdMazFsbEVTb0RjYldYY3NYMjFpUHNFRHp1U09udE5XZUZ6R3JXTlBSajloYzRFWk9KOUd6enA0amZ4WHN6LVdNLU8zVkJlcjhuUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A third state is now part of the growing measles outbreak in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html" target="_blank"&gt;health officials in Oklahoma reported &lt;/a&gt;two “probable” cases in the state that appear to be linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing outbreak in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, the two people developed measles symptoms after exposure to cases associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The individuals isolated immediately after they realized they had been exposed and stayed home throughout the period they were contagious, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The two cases come as the outbreak in West Texas continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; said that 223 measles cases had been confirmed in the state, up from 198 last week.

                                        &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. grapples with its first measles deaths in nearly a decade, health officials are urging Southern Californians to verify their vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated people have died of measles in the past two weeks — including a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;child in rural Texas&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5320352/measles-rfk-west-texas-outbreak" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;adult in a New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — part of an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far,  there have been more than 220 measles cases reported in 12 U.S. states this year, compared with 285 throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, L.A. County officials confirmed a case in a resident who recently had traveled through LAX. Passengers "assigned to specific seats" on China Airlines flight CAL8/CI8 arriving March 5 will be notified that they may have been exposed, according to a news release from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Local officials said they're working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, people at the following locations are cautioned of possible exposure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday, March 5, from 7 p.m. to 10:40 p.m. at Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, March 7, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.: Cloud 9 Nail Salon, 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monday, March 10, from 8:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Superior Grocery Store, 10683 Valley Blvd., El Monte.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no active outbreak in California, there are now &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;five confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the state since January, according to the California Department of Public Health. That includes an infected &lt;a class="Link" href="https://laist.com/news/health/health-officials-warn-of-potential-measles-exposure-at-lax" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;infant who traveled through &lt;u&gt;LAX&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of 2024, there were 15 confirmed measles cases in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has strict student &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/laws-california-law.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vaccination laws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and an average vaccination rate above 96% among kindergartners, but health officials warn that the region remains vulnerable because of international travel connections and pockets of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine provides the best protection against the disease. According to the CDC, 94% of reported cases have been in unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have questions about measles and your risks in Southern California? We have answers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What’s causing the current spike in U.S. measles cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cause is declining vaccination rates, experts say. Outbreaks are most likely to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a class="Link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural west Texas county where the current outbreak is centered has an 82% MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners, according to &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;state health records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason we are seeing measles outbreaks is solely because some parents are not protecting their children from this highly contagious disease by immunizing them,” said John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And in some cases, it’s because adults who have not been vaccinated are choosing to remain unvaccinated," Swartzberg continued. "There is no other explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities have fallen below the 95% threshold in recent years, health experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The primary reason for lower vaccination rates has been misinformation spreading through the internet and social media about potential harms of vaccination,” said Saahir Khan, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at USC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent example is a scientific paper from the early 1990s that claimed to find a link between vaccination and autism — the study was later debunked and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retracted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, the CDC is planning a study to revisit that topic, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-plans-study-into-vaccines-autism-sources-say-2025-03-07/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How common is measles in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;officially eliminated from the United States in 2000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means there is no continuous transmission of the disease originating within the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cases typically begin when travelers bring measles from abroad. Local outbreaks can occur when the disease reaches communities with pockets of unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of people reported to have measles each year has ranged from a low of 37 people in 2004 to a high of 1,282 in 2019, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the likelihood of a measles outbreak in Southern California?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak in the Los Angeles area is much less likely than in rural Texas because Southern California counties have generally maintained vaccination rates above 95% among school-aged children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kern County, which borders L.A. County, had an MMR vaccination rate below 92% during the 2022-23 school year. That year, 12 Northern California counties also had vaccination rates below the threshold for herd immunity, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2022-23KindergartenFirstGradeSummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if there are pockets of people who have not been vaccinated within Southern California, an outbreak could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are likely specific communities within Los Angeles that have lower vaccination rates and are at risk of outbreaks, as we have observed in other areas as with the Somali community in Minnesota or the Orthodox Jewish community in New York,” Khan said. “Unfortunately, vaccine misinformation has been targeted at these communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-level data on vaccination rates are available through annual school reporting audits conducted by the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data provided for the 2021-22 academic year shows more than 200 schools in Los Angeles County with less than 95% of students vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out recent MMR vaccination rates at your child’s school or childcare facility (or schools in your ZIP code) in an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/HowDoing.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;interactive map and database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained by state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Has Southern California had a measles outbreak before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Southern California has experienced several measles outbreaks in recent years. The most significant was a 2014-15 outbreak associated with Disneyland, which infected at least 131 California residents and spread to other states and countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 73 confirmed measles cases in California, including 41 cases associated with six outbreaks. Five of those outbreaks were linked to patients who traveled internationally, according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I was vaccinated as a kid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received two doses of the measles vaccine as a child, you are considered protected for life and do not need a booster dose, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exposed to the virus, two doses of measles vaccine are about 97% effective, according to the CDC. One dose is about 93% effective. In the rare cases when vaccinated people do contract measles, they typically experience milder symptoms and are less contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received only one dose as a child and were born after 1957, you are generally considered protected. But the CDC recommends that people in some groups ensure they’ve had two doses, including college students, healthcare workers and international travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you received the killed measles vaccine (an earlier formulation used between 1963-1967), you should ask your doctor about getting revaccinated with the current MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not get vaccinated, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone is unsure, has not been vaccinated, or does not think they completed the full series and may be at higher risk they should talk with their doctor about getting a booster dose,” said Scott Roberts, assistant professor of Infectious Diseases at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I've had the measles before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. The CDC considers you protected from measles if you have medical records confirming you had measles at some point in your life. Natural immunity after measles infection is lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are generally considered to have lifelong natural immunity because of widespread exposure to measles prior to the introduction of the vaccination program in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if I don't have my vaccination records?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t find your vaccination records or other proof of measles immunity, the CDC recommends getting the MMR vaccine. There is no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune, according to the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could have a healthcare provider test your blood to determine whether you’re immune, but this is generally not recommended, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The antibody test is less helpful since it waxes and wanes, is variable by lab, and doesn’t measure all arms of the immune system,” said Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should my baby get an early 'bonus dose'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early doses of the MMR vaccine (before 12 months) are typically only recommended for infants traveling to countries with high measles rates or living in areas with active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no active outbreak in Southern California currently, experts recommend sticking with the regular vaccination timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early "bonus doses" don't count toward the two-dose series needed for school entry, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children who receive an early dose still need their regular doses at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine works best if you get it for the first time between 12 and 15 months,” said Swartzberg. “If you get it earlier than 12 months, you’ll need to get two more doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned parents should talk to their child’s pediatrician, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How contagious is measles? How serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is extremely contagious. The virus is airborne and can live in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours. Each infected person can spread the disease to as many as 18 others who are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccination program began in 1963, 3 million to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States, according to CDC estimates. Those cases resulted in 48,000 hospitalizations and between 400 and 500 deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, for every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically develop one to two weeks after exposure and occur in several stages:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial symptoms: High fever, cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two to three days later: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After three to 5 days: A rash breaks out, beginning on the face and spreading to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should I do if I think I've been exposed to measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you've been exposed, federal health officials recommend the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor ASAP — don’t go straight to a medical facility without calling because you could put others at risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your immunity status (vaccination history, past infection).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and avoid public places for three weeks if you're unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for symptoms even if you're vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, isolate yourself and call your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-end"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Vaccines clearly save lives, there’s no question about the science of that,” O’Leary said. Better understanding what parents want to learn from their pediatrician – or adults’ questions about their own shots -- is “really about improving care and not just necessarily about just the vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You can’t say you’re for vaccine safety and not study how people think about vaccines,” added Dr. Georges Benjamin of the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the canceled grants are a type that help fund the salaries of promising young researchers, whose careers may be threatened, O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s the latest move against vaccines since Robert F.

Researchers found that compromised sleep quality leads to dysfunction in this crucial system, potentially increasing risks for memory decline and cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced brain imaging in 72 older adults, the research highlighted that poor sleep negatively impacts connections within brain networks linked to memory performance. These insights emphasize the importance of maintaining good sleep hygiene to support brain health and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Brain Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep quality impairs the brain’s glymphatic system, crucial for clearing harmful proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Dysfunctional glymphatic activity due to poor sleep correlates with memory decline in older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep quality directly influences brain networks, affecting overall cognitive health and aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sleep among older adults is linked to disruptions in the brain’s “waste removal system”, according to researchers at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Professor Tatia M.C. Lee, Chair Professor of Psychological Science and Clinical Psychology and May Professor in Neuropsychology at HKU, offers valuable insight into how sleep quality impacts brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have linked poor sleep with a decline in brain functioning. Professor Lee’s team focused on the glial-lymphatic (glymphatic) system, a fluid transport pathway that plays a vital role in clearing waste from the brain. The system’s efficiency is a critical determinant of brain health, particularly in ageing populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Lee and her team sought to understand the glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of toxic proteins, and this process has recently been implicated in several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep quality, brain activities, and glyphamtic functioning are related. Understanding how sleep quality influences the glymphatic system and human brain networks offers valuable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning age-related memory change,” Professor Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team studied 72 older adults using functional MRI scans and sleep recordings.  The findings indicate that poor sleep quality adversely affects normal brain function by deactivating the restorative glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results clearly reveal the effect of sleep on the human brain’s network through the glymphatic system, which in turn affects memory performance in older adults,” said Professor Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Therefore, maintaining efficient glymphatic functioning seems crucial for promoting healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impaired memory is a common complaint among older adults with poor sleep quality,” Professor Lee noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results provide a novel perspective on the interplay between sleep, the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in an article entitled “Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e6efe2e9f1e5ededc8e0e3fda6e0e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jaymee Ng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hku.hk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jaymee Ng – University of Hong Kong&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02778-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Tatia M.C.

A proxy of the glymphatic functioning was obtained from the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional brain networks were constructed based on MRI data, and coupling between the two networks (SC-FC coupling) was also calculated. Correlation analyses revealed that DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with sleep quality measures [e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and apnea-hypopnea index].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding human brain networks, DTI-ALPS was associated with the strength of both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) involving regions such as the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as with the SC-FC coupling of rich-club connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we found that DTI-ALPS positively mediated the association between sleep quality and rich-club SC-FC coupling. The rich-club SC-FC coupling further mediated the association between DTI-ALPS and memory function in good sleepers but not in poor sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest a disrupted glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships and the interplay between the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5IN2JHNjd6dzlDRTV1V0RQVWZWUkVGUldGdTdTenVFRE5nUWJjRm92OWZVZ1FCMlRtMEJVeUotS1NNNEhMSXBpTVBfUUY0Q3BuOXkwM3Z3RjBocmZzam1tNHV2VHE4R1ZoN3A3SXlYbFlqVnM</guid></item><item><title>Man Whose Daughter Died From Measles Stands by Failure to Vaccinate Her: "The Vaccination Has Stuff We Don’t Trust" - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5aQmdLZ2M2dXNEUE4xeVlubWwzRnpjNmMxVWZhaHJuVHJMdmFzV193RDN1Qm5DdmdiNmp6XzZDUXlsNmlDTUdPdkJsNHg1c0ZMWWhjbHlTLVNJZVE5LVJiT3J0bXJwY3hEcjBwNDZxTXduQjZZZkQteQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far, there's only been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one confirmed death&lt;/a&gt; in the measles outbreak spreading across North America — and the father of the unvaccinated child who died of the preventable disease is expressing no regrets about failing to get her the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a startling &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the father of the six-year-old girl who became the first measles death in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;in 10 years&lt;/a&gt; discussed the beliefs that led up to her dying from an infectious disease that was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eradicated at the turn of the last century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identified only as Peter, the father at the heart of this tragedy is, like many others in Seminole, the small West Texas town at the center of the outbreak, a member of the traditional-minded Christian sect known as Mennonites. There's apparently nothing in that group's doctrine barring modern medicine, but like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8858841/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;many other conservative religious groups&lt;/a&gt;, many Mennonites are vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust," Peter told &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. "We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter insists that measles is a normal part of life — although for much of the country, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/well/measles-outbreaks-texas-rfk-jr.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;it is not&lt;/a&gt;, and hasn't been for decades in the wake of generations of successful vaccination campaigns against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has it," the man told the magazine. "It’s not so new for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those comments echo claims made by new Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who said during president Donald Trump's first televised cabinet meeting at the end of February that it was "&lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMikeMendoza/status/1895219682673861020" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;not unusua&lt;/a&gt;l" for measles cases to spike from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have measles outbreaks every year," the political scion claimed — a claim that is only true now because anti-vaxxers like him and the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;group he used to lead&lt;/a&gt; have made people afraid to get them for fear of "injury" from these proven-safe inoculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/anti-vaxxers-aghast-rfk-jr-vaccines" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;since changed his tune&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/rfk-measles-scrutiny-00214952" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;increased scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-dangers-of-rfk-jrs-measles-response" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;handle the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; taking place on his watch, the father of the six-year-old girl claimed by the disease has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has to die," he told &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic's &lt;/em&gt;Tom Bartlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Peter appeared to become emotional after that admission, telling the columnist that it was "very hard" to deal with the "big hole" in his life resulting from the loss of his young child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's impossible to imagine what the man is going through — if only because it seems cruel to hold onto such regressive beliefs in the face of unnecessary death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on measles:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/anti-vaxxers-aghast-rfk-jr-vaccines" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Vaxxers Aghast as RFK Jr. Admits That Vaccines Are Pretty Fantastic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:37:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5aQmdLZ2M2dXNEUE4xeVlubWwzRnpjNmMxVWZhaHJuVHJMdmFzV193RDN1Qm5DdmdiNmp6XzZDUXlsNmlDTUdPdkJsNHg1c0ZMWWhjbHlTLVNJZVE5LVJiT3J0bXJwY3hEcjBwNDZxTXduQjZZZkQteQ</guid></item><item><title>Disturbing response of Texas father whose 6-year-old daughter became first US measles death in a decade - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSHlpZXhXcXhOc3RYRDRyS0ZwTzJQSjE3R3F6OGhodkw2X1FJWEYySTJ2bUxta2s0bXh4eFY1TWxoMTljUkJsUXhVTG93akhPa01LbFRKWFVpTWIwTURqWjA2dTBfYWUySDRSWWZGQnZUSW4tb2FRR3ZEX1E5c20wOFhla05wRkxhbjc5MVFZOVlRMzY4ZmJv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE9JdDAtTktLM0pMaXM0UUFvUzVzNUhsQk45OGRsU2o0T3c3dDhlZU1ZUUxQOE5hNDc1bmxvUUVjbEd0ZGk5VXQxSnlQRE9kTHVYbDB0c0Mwck9QT2tJbnJKc2pkZG5aeF8xVnlvcnIxYkhqd2VSLWFkYjhXbENLeTBvampCTUkzXzVUYkptTmZ0RFZnZTd2TmV1US01cA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-6e405b80-feb2-11ef-9180-5771d3671259"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; man whose daughter became America's first measles death in a decade has spoken out about his loss for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter, who declined to provide his last name, choked back tears when a reporter asked him if he knew the victim in a parking lot, saying: 'That's our kid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-five and 28-year-old construction worker said his girl had only been six years old. She was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473199/texas-measles-outbreak-doctor-cases.html"&gt;unvaccinated, like many in the community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/5lOcg#selection-975.0-984.0"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; it was 'God's will' that she had died from the disease, before adding, 'everyone has to die.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said he considers getting measles a normal part of life and still maintains doubts about the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show the shot is 97 percent effective against measles, while extensive research has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14474409/CDC-study-link-vaccines-autism-bombshell-move.html"&gt;drawn no link between the vaccine and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girl, who was not named, was the first of two people to have died in the outbreak, with another fatality reported in an unvaccinated adult in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-8f5b0b30-febc-11ef-9180-5771d3671259"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are the first fatalities from the disease in the US since 2015. More than 250  people have been infected and 29 have been hospitalized in the most recent outbreak that has spread from Texas to New Mexico and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oklahoma/index.html" id="mol-ef942a30-fec2-11ef-bd5e-dd3e735ad835"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 28-year-old Mennonite man named Peter in Seminole, Texas, revealed his six-year-old daughter was America's first measles death in a decade.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing his daughter was the first fatality to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, Peter said he belongs to a Mennonite community in Seminole, Texas, where many of its residents are unvaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing his daughter's illness, he said she had been sick for three weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family knew it was measles and took her to the hospital at one point, but doctors gave her cough medicine and told the family to 'go home.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They don't want to help us,' Peter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as the girl's condition deteriorated, the family brought her back to doctors who put her on a ventilator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter explained: 'She just kept getting sicker and sicker. Her lungs plugged up. We were there Saturday ’til Monday, three days … and then it was worse, very bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That Tuesday, the girl died of pneumonia, which is common in severe measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most Texas cases, 156 in total, have been in Gaines county, where Seminole is located. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccination rate in the area is 82 percent, well below the 95 percent needed to maintain herd immunity. The national average was 93 percent last school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows Seminole, in the west of Texas, where the outbreak was first reported. Seminole is located in Gaines county, which has reported the majority of cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Texas officials have set up a mobile unit to offer tests and vaccinations for measles to parents and children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many in Mennonite communities like Peter's are unvaccinated, though those figures are not reflected in official data, as the children are often homeschooled or enrolled in nonaccredited schools that don't have to collect data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The religious doctrine does not forbid vaccines, though many residents, including Peter, have doubts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said measles is considered normal for the community and 'everybody has it. It's not so new for us.' He had also heard getting measles could strengthen the immune system against other diseases, a theory Robert F Kennedy Jr has promoted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter also worries about the vaccine's potential effects on his children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust. We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We heard too much, and we saw too much'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter also insisted the Mennonite community, where most of the Texas cases are centered, has been unjustly singled out and that it's not just Mennonites spreading the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter said his daughter's death was 'very hard' and that it left 'a big hole' in his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before telling reporters he had nothing else to say, he added: 'You probably know how it goes when somebody passes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's really hard to believe.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:25:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSHlpZXhXcXhOc3RYRDRyS0ZwTzJQSjE3R3F6OGhodkw2X1FJWEYySTJ2bUxta2s0bXh4eFY1TWxoMTljUkJsUXhVTG93akhPa01LbFRKWFVpTWIwTURqWjA2dTBfYWUySDRSWWZGQnZUSW4tb2FRR3ZEX1E5c20wOFhla05wRkxhbjc5MVFZOVlRMzY4ZmJv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE9JdDAtTktLM0pMaXM0UUFvUzVzNUhsQk45OGRsU2o0T3c3dDhlZU1ZUUxQOE5hNDc1bmxvUUVjbEd0ZGk5VXQxSnlQRE9kTHVYbDB0c0Mwck9QT2tJbnJKc2pkZG5aeF8xVnlvcnIxYkhqd2VSLWFkYjhXbENLeTBvampCTUkzXzVUYkptTmZ0RFZnZTd2TmV1US01cA</guid></item><item><title>Vermont confirms first case of measles of year in school-aged child - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBKM0ZKdWpYVmxsZy1GdUUzMlRNVkFGSmZxVTlnaE0wQ19TeXZiMlh4SHpjRi1UUkRPZndGaUVRemxUMnhSMVZzc3g3bWFKUF9acXNMUlpudmtKbEd3d3hnWnhTZ2tFZ1pUWF9tOVpFeGlDOWJjaExQZ0IteVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The first case of measles in Vermont in 2025 has been confirmed in a school-aged child in Lamoille county, the &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/vermont-department-health-confirms-case-measles#:~:text=WATERBURY%2C%20VT%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Vermont%20Department,traveling%20internationally%20in%20recent%20days" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Vermontdepartment of health&lt;/a&gt; reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child became sick in recent days after returning with their family from traveling internationally and has been isolated from most community settings while they have been contagious, according to the department.

At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/measles-death-new-mexico" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;it was reported&lt;/a&gt; that an unvaccinated adult who was infected with measles had died in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBKM0ZKdWpYVmxsZy1GdUUzMlRNVkFGSmZxVTlnaE0wQ19TeXZiMlh4SHpjRi1UUkRPZndGaUVRemxUMnhSMVZzc3g3bWFKUF9acXNMUlpudmtKbEd3d3hnWnhTZ2tFZ1pUWF9tOVpFeGlDOWJjaExQZ0IteVk</guid></item><item><title>Vermont reports case of measles in school-aged child - VTDigger</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQWHpNX0pneUhVVHNnY0phNGlGMjF6cUdYU05xYkZWVHVwS2JYYUZmYnJNcFd1eXFURUxJb0pXaElJT0FWVHpqUHNDNk9sQjBxQUZzWXo0dUJWQU1pemlGY2dzT09rZlg3aU45TlJUd1JEWlVsOExTMkZnTGVqdW4tLXduVDRNcENPdWIxWU1B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

Image via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles in a school-aged child in Lamoille County — the first to be discovered in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unnamed child became sick after travelling internationally with family. The risk to the public is believed to be “low,” but Vermonters who may have been exposed to the child at the Copley Hospital emergency department may need to take action to protect others, according to a Tuesday press release from the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child tested positive Monday after visiting Copley Hospital in Morrisville the day prior. Anyone who was inside the hospital’s emergency department between 3:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday should confirm their immunity to measles through vaccination or previous infection, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/signs-symptoms.html"&gt;monitor for symptoms&lt;/a&gt; through March 30, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot confirm your immunity by contacting your health care provider or &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/registries/immunization-registry#requests"&gt;requesting your immunization records&lt;/a&gt;, you should call the health department at 802-863-7240, option 2 for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is the first case of measles reported in the state in 2025, there were &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2024/04/23/vermont-confirms-first-measles-case-since-2018/"&gt;two documented cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, one in 2018 and another in 2011, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This most recent case has not been linked to ongoing outbreaks in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"&gt;southern United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/measles/measles-outbreak"&gt;Québec&lt;/a&gt;, according to the department. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"&gt;more than 200 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, up from just 58 in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health department officials urged Vermonters to get themselves and their children vaccinated for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials attribute the recent uptick in measles, in part, “to an increase in the number of unvaccinated people, which impacts community immunity,” the department said in the release. About &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/surveillance-reporting-topic/school-vaccination-data"&gt;93% of school-aged children&lt;/a&gt; in Vermont are vaccinated for measles — below the 95% benchmark that experts believe is essential for herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;most contagious diseases worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and can be deadly, especially in children under 5. One in five unvaccinated people with measles end up hospitalized for the disease, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a high fever, a cough, and a rash a few days after initial symptoms appear.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaem001s3b73l6a9b0lw@published"&gt;My partner of 10 years tested positive for HIV two years into our relationship. I’ve continued to test negative, but we haven’t been intimate for over two years now (we had some problems that included a separation; I was the one that initiated our getting back together). It was good, at first.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="209" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84xlnso002y3b73tdkrjr3f@published"&gt;But some of the issues that caused our breakup have resurfaced; without getting too deep, it’s largely his temper, an inability to admit faults, and what I perceive as a lack of respect for me. Frankly, I feel disinclined to take the risks involved with sex, regardless of how small they might be (as a child of the ‘80s/’90s, getting over my phobic level fear hasn’t been easy) for someone who hasn’t been treating me well. It’s also difficult to trust his claims that he never forgets his medication and has remained undetectable when I’m catching him in lies about other things. I’m also aware that a part of me is allowing him to get away with more than I should, or normally would, and maybe even staying with him out of a feeling of guilt or horror at the thought of him facing this alone. I don’t know what to do. Either way I look at it, this is impacting every aspect of my relationship. I don’t want fear to guide me but I also don’t want to stay with someone who’s not treating me right, simply because I feel obligated. I don’t even know what I want to do, or if I can trust my own feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyajw001v3b73n86csdtp@published"&gt;Let’s take your partner’s HIV status out of the equation for a moment. You’re looking at a person who has a concerning temper, refuses to admit faults (and, therefore, probably refuses to work on them), and shows a lack of respect for you. You also don’t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaln001w3b73swbdt9u3@published"&gt;Leave. It doesn’t matter how much you love a person, how badly you feel about their situation, or how much you want to support them. You need to protect yourself first, and being in a relationship with someone who has a temper, who disrespects you, and who you don’t trust is simply dangerous. Despite the messages we receive from our cultures, love does not actually mean we have to behave in any certain way. We can love someone and never see them again because that’s what’s best for one or both of us. We can love someone and limit our interactions with them. Love does not obligate us to tolerate unacceptable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaoh001x3b734mqaymd8@published"&gt;As far as the HIV layer of your situation, you’re correct that a person with undetectable status (and, therefore, what the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable"&gt;calls a clear inability to transmit the virus&lt;/a&gt; sexually) only remains that way if they’re taking their medication properly, which means taking the pills consistently and also keeping up with medical appointments and listening to their doctor’s advice. As much as the vestiges of ‘80s and ‘90s-era uncertainty, fear, and shaming are present in your reaction, your inability to trust your partner points to a very real risk. Sure, you could make sure condoms are also in the equation. But the line in your letter about being less inclined to take risks for someone who hasn’t been treating you well speaks to my earlier point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyavf001y3b736wfe8vgo@published"&gt;You do have a lot of feelings to work through—anyone would after a 10-year relationship—and a therapist would likely be a great support as you do so. If that kind of treatment isn’t an option, you might consider journaling, talking with trusted friends who are good with listening and empathy, or anything else that’s served you well while processing emotions over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vvoka003pejm4035dhcto@published"&gt;For most of our five-year relationship, my partner has considered not shaving her pubes. Besides finding it generally tedious, she has a common, non-STI-related skin condition that periodically flares up on different parts of her body (including her genital area), which shaving exacerbates. She continued shaving for most of our relationship due to struggles with her body image. After a recent flare-up, and me continuously reiterating my genuine support, she finally decided to stop shaving and grow out her pubes. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/girlfriend-bush-pubic-hair-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, I recently ate her out post-flareup, with a fully grown bush…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Conditions like narcissistic personality disorder, anorexia, and body dysmorphic disorder thrive on social platforms, allowing users to build and maintain distorted self-perceptions without real-world checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights how virtual environments enable users to escape social scrutiny, intensifying delusional self-images and potentially exacerbating existing mental health issues.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disorders include narcissistic personality disorder (delusions of superiority), erotomania (delusions that someone famous loves you), body dysmorphic disorder (delusions of flaws in some part of one’s body) and anorexia (delusions about body size).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Social media is creating conditions where delusions can more easily be generated and sustained due to the presence of platforms and apps that cater to the disorder’s causes, plus the absence of effective reality-checking,” says Bernard Crespi, a professor of biological sciences and Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Genetics and Psychology at SFU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research has important implications for the causes and symptoms of mental illnesses, and how they can be exacerbated by online social platforms.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the authors, social media itself isn’t inherently problematic, but the virtual worlds – coupled with social isolation in “real life” – create environments where people can maintain a delusional sense of self identity without scrutiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While social media can have positive benefits through its ability to create communities and help people feel more togetherness, Crespi and his co-author Nancy Yang argue that higher-risk individuals are often negatively impacted by high social media use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also point out that the features of many popular apps and platforms sustain and exacerbate mental and physical delusions, by enabling self-presentation in self-promoting but inaccurate ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The profound difference between online and in-person social interactions – where people are more likely to have their delusions kept in check by physical and emotional reality – exacerbate deviations from mental well-being, he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study concludes that people with disorders involving high levels of delusionality would benefit from reducing their social media use. It also calls for more research to be done on the specific features of social media that encourage delusions and look for ways to make online social interactions more grounded and real life-like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve this, the researchers cite the potential of eye-contact technology, 3D perspectives, avatars and other immersive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and delusional disorder research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e984889d9db682808c859d908288a99a8f9cc78a88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Kieltyka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfu.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Kieltyka – Simon Fraser University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-025-06528-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;I tweet, therefore I am: a systematic review on social media use and disorders of the social brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Bernard Crespi et al. &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tweet, therefore I am: a systematic review on social media use and disorders of the social brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rapid technological advances, social media has become an everyday form of human social interactions. For the first time in evolutionary history, people can now interact in virtual spaces where temporal, spatial, and embodied cues are decoupled from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What implications do these recent changes have for socio-cognitive phenotypes and mental disorders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have conducted a systematic review on the relationships between social media use and mental disorders involving the social brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main findings indicate evidence of increased social media usage in individuals with psychotic spectrum phenotypes and especially among individuals with disorders characterized by alterations in the basic self, most notably narcissism, body dysmorphism, and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings can be understood in the context of a new conceptual model, referred to here as ‘Delusion Amplification by Social Media’, whereby this suite of disorders and symptoms centrally involves forms of mentalistic delusions, linked with altered perception and perpetuation of distorted manifestations of the self, that are enabled and exacerbated by social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, an underdeveloped and incoherent sense of self, in conjunction with ‘real life’ social isolation that inhibits identify formation and facilitates virtual social interactions, may lead to use of social media to generate and maintain a more or less delusional sense of self identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delusions involved may be mental (as in narcissism and erotomania), or somatic (as in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, encompassing either the entire body or specific body parts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the virtual nature of social media facilitates the delusionality because the self is defined and bolstered in this highly mentalistic environment, where real-life exposure of the delusion can be largely avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current evidence also suggests that increased social media usage, via its disembodied and isolative nature, may be associated with psychotic spectrum phenotypes, especially delusionality, by the decoupling of inter and intra-corporeal cues integral to shared reality testing, leading to the blurring of self-other boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:49:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1acXRrNFR5WkRJWmlsQTExaEM0elc2bUotVHprRFAyWVlDdnNka01qNkctUnVDTE1hTlk2Zk15Z0tUVndQNDh0VEhiaXlLWjhoQS00SVEta1oxb1NRZ1h6NUtmeEZLSkJreXZkc1pCdDBTcmhlbzY1bA</guid></item><item><title>Vermont Reports Case of Measles in School-Age Child - Seven Days</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQM2pMclk1cGxEak5yU3FQTVlPSWVCdGRUZG5OYU5NSEtGM2dZRG42VXdCaVRKVDMxcWctSGNUTkM0amFUUW9XMHA1ZUlRNFV3c1Q1MzlVUFdBaDhOYWd0MURQWlF5aXFCSmRBNHhHTTF1TGdlTzlISUw1bEEtelhHVjkwN0tXN0Vm?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyBody" class="page1 apple_news home_feature section_feature navigation_feature"&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
   The child, who had recently traveled internationally with family, was evaluated at Copley Hospital in Morrisville on Sunday and has since been isolated, the health department said, calling the threat to the public low. 
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Those who were at Copley's emergency department between 3:15 and 6 p.m. on Sunday should confirm they’ve been vaccinated against measles by calling their health care provider or &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/registries/immunization-registry#requests" target="_blank"&gt;requesting their health records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the health department said. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      They should also monitor themselves for symptoms through the end of the month and contact a health care provider from home if they become symptomatic. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      “DO NOT go to the doctor’s office, the hospital, or a clinic without first calling to let them know about your symptoms and possible exposure,” a press release said. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious illness, especially in young children. Symptoms typically start with a cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a high fever. A spotted rash then breaks out on the head before spreading to the rest of the body.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Roughly one in five people who catch measles will be hospitalized, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      The new case marks the first in Vermont this year following two in 2024 and one in 2018. 
       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The case is not related to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/measles/measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing measles outbreak in Québec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the health department said. Nor is it connected to outbreaks occurring in and around Texas and New Mexico that have led to more than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/well/measles-outbreak-symptoms.html" target="_blank"&gt;250 reported cases and two deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, including one unvaccinated child. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      The news comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about America's declining vaccination rates. Such fears have only grown in the weeks since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as secretary of Health and Human Services. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      A well-known vaccine skeptic, Kennedy said at his confirmation hearings that he supports measles immunization and would not discourage anyone from receiving it. But he has been accused of downplaying the seriousness of the Texas outbreak. Rather than urging people to get vaccinated, he has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;expressed support for unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, such as cod liver oil.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Ninety-three percent of schoolchildren have been vaccinated against measles in Vermont, short of the 95 percent that experts say is necessary for herd immunity. 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      It is unclear whether the recently infected Vermont child was immunized; the health department says it does not disclose such information, citing patient privacy.

Few know this better than Daniel Eisenberg. In 2007 the &lt;small&gt;UCLA&lt;/small&gt; health-policy professor, then at the University of Michigan, sent a mental-health survey to 5,591 college students and found that 22% showed signs of depression. Over the next 15 years as new students were polled this figure grew. In 2022, when more than 95,000 students at 373 universities were surveyed, a staggering 44% displayed symptoms of depression. Then, curiously, the trend reversed. In 2023 41% of students seemed depressed; in 2024, the figure fell again to 38%. Mr Eisenberg is cautiously optimistic. “It’s the first time that things are moving in a positive direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:48:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOWVM0NGNNVHFQUlZCNmhrUzNtWm5Wc2JfMkJMVFpjNC1vOHBwR0xXMU9IYmhYN2pkWVBRT0l0QnRhYXIxN1VUOEc1VlBHZ295NllTVDl6NERfV0NnVXpNSlphb1NnY2ZVdTRkOEpQY3RIOElCOXZFVGRqWnpIS2lCSmtfMnM1Y1dlMmt0UlJtaw</guid></item><item><title>Measles case confirmed in Vermont - WCAX</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBfbnJnRE1uc3I0ZkZZMzUyQl9zQjBoT3Joek81UmRmYmpXckJUejJtcXdlV05Mam56a2o5QUVGNDdiUEt4bERMU2VrTUtZaFpHcGExSE9YWGdSS3MwT2tfZ1o3UGZ3eG01SFpaUFRXNlLSAYQBQVVfeXFMT0xDcEgtWmdxZ1QxS0RFMVVEc0tWQkVoSnFlZ1VqTEh0TUs4S2ttRE5PSFoycldFcHJraU9IbDJ3UVRZMjc0b0MwY0Y0aWtkMVFrNy1BUzhDMVlkQ3JJUG1OM0w3ZDg5QmZnNVFob19vMTNCUGNuYnNzdUxyRDNqVkt5RDZY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;MORRISVILLE, Vt. (WCAX) - Health officials have confirmed a case of measles in Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Vermont Health Department says a school-aged child in Lamoille County was diagnosed with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;They say the child got sick after traveling internationally with their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials say the risk to the public is low because the child has been mostly isolated. But they were at Copley Hospital’s emergency room on Sunday night. The hospital has reached out to known visitors to the ER during that time. &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/vermont-department-health-confirms-case-measles" target="_blank"&gt;They’re asking anyone who was inside Copley’s Emergency Department in Morrisville between 3:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday, March 9, to follow the instructions listed on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This is the first case of measles in Vermont in 2025, following two cases in 2024 and two cases in the decade prior, one in 2011 and one in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say this case is not related to the three ongoing outbreaks of measles in the U.S. or the current measles outbreak in Québec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious illness. Health officials urge Vermonters to make sure their families are vaccinated against measles, especially children. &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/measles" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more about measles and symptoms.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WCAX.

&lt;h2&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;on Tuesday provided an outbreak update&lt;/a&gt;, raising the case count to 223, up 25 from the 198 Texas cases reported Friday. Of the Texas cases, 29 have been hospitalized and one has died—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;a 6-year-old girl from Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, the outbreak's epicenter. The girl was unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak continues to be primarily in unvaccinated children. Of the 223 cases, 76 are in ages 0 to 4, and 98 are between ages 5 and 17. Of the cases, 80 are unvaccinated, 138 lack vaccination status, and five are known to have received at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One dose of MMR is estimated to be 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses offer 98 percent protection. It's not unexpected to see a small number of breakthrough cases in large, localized outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the border from Gaines County in Texas sits Lea County, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico officials have now documented 32 cases,&lt;/a&gt; with an additional case reported in neighboring Eddy County, bringing the state's current total to 33. Of those cases, one person has been hospitalized and one person (not hospitalized) died. The death was an adult who did not seek medical care and tested positive for measles only after death. The cause of their death is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of New Mexico's 33 cases, 27 were unvaccinated and five did not have a vaccination status, and one had received at least one MMR dose. Eighteen of the 33 cases are in adults, 13 are ages 0 to 17, and two cases have no confirmed age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html?"&gt;a travel alert over the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. "With spring and summer travel season approaching in the United States, CDC emphasizes the important role that clinicians and public health officials play in preventing the spread of measles," the agency said in the alert. It advised clinicians to be vigilant in identifying potential measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency stressed the importance of vaccination, putting in bold: "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; remains the most important tool for preventing measles,&lt;/strong&gt;" while saying that "all US residents should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, has been emphasizing cod liver oil, which does not prevent measles, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html"&gt;falsely blaming the outbreak on poor nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some days, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9292521/100-days-long-Covid-torture-counting.html"&gt;even one task feels impossible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid has forced one in 10 Americans to stop working or reduce their hours, leading to higher rates of people with the condition being unable to pay their mortgage, buy food, and keep up with doctor visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of long Covid. About half of people with the wide-reaching condition meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, according to researchers &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses"&gt;at Yale University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has severely limited Dr Cohen’s life, as it has millions of other former Covid patients. People have been made to put off social activities – jeopardizing friendships – and leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fatigue made her ‘bone tired all the time… even after sleeping solidly through the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dizziness and brain fog are also common complaints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trouble finding words, remembering facts, difficulty concentrating, and following conversions are some effects of brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973396/"&gt;20 and 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of long Covid sufferers have reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That can be described as the cognitive equivalent of trying to wade through shoulder-high mud,’ Dr Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid can also &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9748999/Is-whats-causing-long-Covid-Virus-stops-oxygen-flowing-body-properly-study-finds.html"&gt;affect the heart and lungs in the long term.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people with Covid, a respiratory disease, suffer long-lasting scarring that stiffens the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scarring can make it harder to breathe, caused by inflammation that strikes healthy tissue and impairs the lungs’ ability to circulate oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lasting inflammation caused by long Covid also puts &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9944435/COVID-drove-43-spike-heart-inflammation-cases-hospitals-2020.html"&gt;extra strain on the heart&lt;/a&gt;. It can exacerbate issues that people already have in their cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, scarring can cause arteries to stiffen even more than plaque build-up already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most typical effects of Covid on the heart is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It causes the heart to beat abnormally fast, with many having a heartbeat of 120 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation damages small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels widen or constrict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood vessels may not constrict properly in people with POTS. Instead, the heart rate increases even more than usual to compensate for these lazy blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There have been millions of Americans diagnosed with long Covid, which causes symptoms that last for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term Covid can cause lasting changes to the immune system, making it weaker and making typical infections like Covid reinfection and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-72d18f50-fea5-11ef-85e7-051a2971f0fa"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Long Covid has forced one in 10 Americans to cut work hours or stop working, leaving many unable to afford housing, food, or medical care &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘The only thing we know that makes long COVID worse is getting re-infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means I work very hard to avoid reinfection. Since I was infected while wearing an N95 mask and being vaccinated, I know that one-way masking is insufficient protection for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the general negative attitude toward masking, Dr Cohen does not feel entirely comfortable going out in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00668-8"&gt;latest research by Dr Cohen&lt;/a&gt; and her team on the antiviral Paxlovid, has yielded mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five of the 13 people in the clinical trial experienced symptom relief, such as reduced brain fog after 15 days on the drug, whereas the rest didn’t see any lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘We are about 5 years into the pandemic, and there are not yet any federally approved treatments for long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is not a silver bullet, but it may help a lot of people in a meaningful way.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8839587/Long-Covid-actually-four-different-syndromes-scientists-admit-dont-know.html"&gt;over 200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—ranging from dizziness&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14482513/Mother-rotting-long-covid-donations-Switzerland-choice-NHS.html"&gt; to severe fatigue&lt;/a&gt; leaving people bed-bound — long Covid lacks a standard test or treatment, leading doctors to misdiagnose it as conditions like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-8e7771b0-feab-11ef-af60-1f43c4be4811" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

People have been made to put off social activities – jeopardizing friendships – and leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fatigue made her ‘bone tired all the time… even after sleeping solidly through the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dizziness and brain fog are also common complaints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trouble finding words, remembering facts, difficulty concentrating, and following conversions are some effects of brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973396/"&gt;20 and 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of long Covid sufferers have reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That can be described as the cognitive equivalent of trying to wade through shoulder-high mud,’ Dr Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid can also &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9748999/Is-whats-causing-long-Covid-Virus-stops-oxygen-flowing-body-properly-study-finds.html"&gt;affect the heart and lungs in the long term.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people with Covid, a respiratory disease, suffer long-lasting scarring that stiffens the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scarring can make it harder to breathe, caused by inflammation that strikes healthy tissue and impairs the lungs’ ability to circulate oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lasting inflammation caused by long Covid also puts &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9944435/COVID-drove-43-spike-heart-inflammation-cases-hospitals-2020.html"&gt;extra strain on the heart&lt;/a&gt;. It can exacerbate issues that people already have in their cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, scarring can cause arteries to stiffen even more than plaque build-up already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most typical effects of Covid on the heart is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It causes the heart to beat abnormally fast, with many having a heartbeat of 120 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation damages small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels widen or constrict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood vessels may not constrict properly in people with POTS. Instead, the heart rate increases even more than usual to compensate for these lazy blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There have been millions of Americans diagnosed with long Covid, which causes symptoms that last for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term Covid can cause lasting changes to the immune system, making it weaker and making typical infections like Covid reinfection and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-72d18f50-fea5-11ef-85e7-051a2971f0fa"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Long Covid has forced one in 10 Americans to cut work hours or stop working, leaving many unable to afford housing, food, or medical care &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘The only thing we know that makes long COVID worse is getting re-infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means I work very hard to avoid reinfection. Since I was infected while wearing an N95 mask and being vaccinated, I know that one-way masking is insufficient protection for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the general negative attitude toward masking, Dr Cohen does not feel entirely comfortable going out in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00668-8"&gt;latest research by Dr Cohen&lt;/a&gt; and her team on the antiviral Paxlovid, has yielded mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five of the 13 people in the clinical trial experienced symptom relief, such as reduced brain fog after 15 days on the drug, whereas the rest didn’t see any lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘We are about 5 years into the pandemic, and there are not yet any federally approved treatments for long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is not a silver bullet, but it may help a lot of people in a meaningful way.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8839587/Long-Covid-actually-four-different-syndromes-scientists-admit-dont-know.html"&gt;over 200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—ranging from dizziness&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14482513/Mother-rotting-long-covid-donations-Switzerland-choice-NHS.html"&gt; to severe fatigue&lt;/a&gt; leaving people bed-bound — long Covid lacks a standard test or treatment, leading doctors to misdiagnose it as conditions like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-8e7771b0-feab-11ef-af60-1f43c4be4811" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified that an eye condition affecting the retina, the light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye, may serve as an early indicator for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings offer new insights into the potential use of retinal changes as early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, which could &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/alzheimers-disease-risk-artificial-intelligence-3234622-2/"&gt;improve diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings indicate that the presence of the APOE4 gene—known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in humans in mice impairs retinal function, suggesting a direct link between this genetic variant and visual processing deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The eye is a window to the brain reflecting changes associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease,” says Ashay Bhatwadekar, associate professor of ophthalmology and principal investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and our study will help provide ease of diagnosis and potential intervention for Alzheimer’s disease, thus enhancing patient outcomes and &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/alzheimers-drugs-extend-independent-living-3269772/"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team used advanced imaging techniques to assess retinal structure and function in the mice. Compared to control groups, they observed significant alterations in retinal thickness and electrical activity in biological tissues and cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings align with clinical observations of retinal abnormalities in Alzheimer’s patients, reinforcing the relevance of this model for studying triggers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates that retinal dysfunction occurs in the APOE4 mouse model, mirroring aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology,” says PhD student Surabhi D. Abhyankar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results underscore the potential of retinal imaging as a non-invasive method to detect early neural changes in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research appears in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14433"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additional researchers are from Indiana University, the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, and the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for this research came from the National Eye Institute and Research to Prevent Blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

Research has shown that it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; after a measles infection for protective immunity to fully return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The measles virus is strongly immunosuppressive, meaning that it will interfere with the normal function of many white cells in the body that fight against other infections,” Fennelly says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One of those infections is bacterial pneumonia, which causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. About one in five people who get sick with measles in the US is hospitalized, and one in 20 will develop pneumonia. In some cases, patients may need supplemental oxygen or intubation and ventilator support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL4J8tcZuSE"&gt;February 28 press briefing&lt;/a&gt;, Ron Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, described the hospitalized patients as having severe symptoms, with many of them also experiencing dehydration and low oxygen levels due to inflammation in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Pneumonia is the most common cause of death for measles in young children,” says Edith Bracho-Sanchez, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn iNCMJD callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE fJvQtP caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd kVUvEC iXWezO caption__text"&gt;Measles can cause serious complications in those without immunity, especially in children under 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd isTgyB fNaHcW caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Ezra Acayan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles can also cause a severe complication called encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Encephalitis can happen during an infection if the virus travels to the brain, or after an infection if the brain becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response. About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. The condition can cause convulsions and in rare cases, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against these complications. One dose of the vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses is 97 percent effective. The first dose is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months old, and the second dose is typically given between the ages of 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are no antiviral treatments available for measles, and while vitamin A is often given to people with an infection, it does not prevent measles or kill the virus. “The infection itself can deplete levels of vitamin A in the body,” Bracho-Sanchez says. Both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend two doses of vitamin A to children who are hospitalized with measles, since vitamin A deficiency can increase the risk of serious complications. However, large doses of vitamin A can be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested that treatment with cod liver oil, which contains vitamin A, is showing “very, very good results” in measles patients. But health experts caution that cod liver oil supplements can contain more vitamin A than the recommended daily amount and can also make children sick if they take too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bracho-Sanchez says the best way to have adequate levels of vitamin A is to eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables. Vaccination, she says, remains the best way to protect against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 3-11-2025 7:37 pm GMT: A misidentification of a quote from Glenn Fennelly was corrected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:09:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQYkpQcWkxbklGQkF4LS1UNkdrVklQcWgwLXZ6UUdHT3RVVWE1VWlsTmkxSlNwQVo3S2ozTTBMUGNIbzZnWERrN2dGVmtHQ1hJZ1JIZnpnaTRFY24td1E2VFVUVnVqX21wdlBTSkdLVUZBcDVyMEpaTG9pd25tVC1ITVBRQmNpVldfblQ4VU5LbE0wNTg3YjE1U2prSHVfTXNyUTJUdA</guid></item><item><title>’27 years later I find out book worms are real’: Expert shares PSA for readers who buy their books at thrift stores - The Daily Dot</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5BQzdZSm1xNnFlRjFzOENCN0NKNWpDY2dUYTJ4c0E5NzFWQWJWSkdGS0tUMU5GYzRqdXc0NVRxNzF0eGRUd0lSWk41N1pSSDVLalVzZDFWVnlWbG05bDNYbzJhUnpEd9IBa0FVX3lxTE1ja2F4ck5PdGlwMDdIc1VaZjZLMzN3cEZ2Z3prdUYza0Z1OG1mTEhZZXdfT2NtSGpZVW9rM1l2ZGtJRUFTYjhYLUVNRUJ0R2NIaHhkTTN3a0VpTE85c2hQLTVLQ28tb3l2dmxv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content-wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you think of the term “bookworm,” an avid reader may pop into your mind. But did you know bookworms are actually real? A BookToker is sharing what she does to prevent them from ruining all of her books.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
        
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang (@them_yangs) is a Maryland-based BookToker. She has 272,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One time, I saw a girl on here get thrifted books and had bookworms,” she says in a video with 3 million views. “She didn’t know, so she put them with the rest of her books, and they just tore through all of them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-make-the-same-mistake"&gt;Don’t make the same mistake &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TikToker is referring to what happened to fellow BookTok creator Izzy (@pickme.chooseme.readwme). In October of 2024, Izzy &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/bookworm-infestation-on-used-books/"&gt;told viewers&lt;/a&gt; to learn from her mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t listen to my friend when she said you have to freeze books,” Izzy said at the time. “And now guess what? I have bookworms.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Izzy said that the incident made her want to cry and had her nervous to open any of her books. “Freeze your books,” she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang is heeding Izzy’s warning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been paranoid. So whenever I get thrifted books, I always freeze them,” she says, holding copies of “All This Twisted Glory” and “Things We Never Got Over.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The content creator sticks the two books into separate freezer bags before sealing them shut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything living in these will no longer be living by the time I get them tomorrow,” Mrs. Yang concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang told the Daily Dot that she’s been freezing her thrifted books ever since she came across Izzy’s video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always had some idea book worms were real but finding out they were silverfish shocked me,” she says. “Now I know they aren’t just silver fish but they are one type.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-bookworms"&gt;What are bookworms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookworms aren’t just book lovers or even worms! They’re insects that eat books and papers. According to &lt;a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/book-lovers"&gt;the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, these bugs can be “booklouse, silverfish, powderpost beetle, spider beetle, common furniture beetle, Mexican book beetle, paper worm (larvae of the paper beetle or moth), and larder beetle.” These creatures &lt;a href="https://artifactservices.com/emergency-care-insect-infestation-books/"&gt;feast&lt;/a&gt; on the materials of old, moldy, and damp books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang has come across a bookworm in the past. “After I finished freezing a book for like two weeks [that] I got from a little free library, I found a bookworm in the bag,” she shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Mrs. Yang isn’t letting bookworms scare her off. Freezing them “seems effective from my experience but I’m just some random person on the internet!” the content creator said. “I will for sure keep thrifting books!’&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And instead of freezing her books for 24 hours, Mrs. Yang usually leaves them in the freezer for longer than that. “I usually end up leaving my books in for a week because I forget about them and many people in the comments said it needs to be at least seventy two hours!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-were-in-disbelief"&gt;Viewers were in disbelief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people didn’t realize that bookworms aren’t just a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“27 years later I find out book worms are real creatures,” one viewer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“Wait, book worms are real?!?! I thought WE were the book worms,” a second echoed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Me as a librarian: is this why libraries are so cold?!? They didn’t teach that part in library school,” a third commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-why-libraries-maintain-chilly-temperatures"&gt;Is this why libraries maintain chilly temperatures?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is. When the building is &lt;a href="https://salve.libanswers.com/faq/335884"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt;, mold growth stops and keeps the books dry. In addition to destroying the books, mold also attracts the pesky bookworms. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thatcherwine.com/blog/cleaning-and-disinfecting-your-books"&gt;Freezing&lt;/a&gt; your used books for at least 48 hours in a plastic bag kills both them and their eggs.

        &lt;p class="intro"&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine can offer 97% protection from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sidead"&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="drop_cap"&gt;Measles cases are increasing in the U.S., with two deaths reported—one involving a child in Texas and another an adult in New Mexico. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;released guidance ahead of spring break travel&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re planning to travel in the coming weeks, stay informed and consult your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far this year, the U.S. has reported three measles outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) and more than 200 people are sick. &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/one-case-of-measles-confirmed-in-maryland-resident-after-international-travel/"&gt;In Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, a positive case was reported after an individual traveled internationally. The state’s health department is working to identify people who may have been exposed to help contain the spread.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases have also been reported in Alaska, California, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Georgia. Across the border, Canada is experiencing an uptick in cases, with 95 reported illnesses in Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus&lt;/a&gt; that can cause serious health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Children under five years old are at the highest risk, but unvaccinated adults can also become seriously ill. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, one in five people who contract measles requires hospitalization.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="video-inline"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Symptoms typically appear 7–10 days after exposure and include high fever, rash, cough, and runny nose. An infected person is contagious four days before the rash appears and remains so for four days after it disappears.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 due to robust immunization efforts. However, declining vaccination rates have led to its resurgence. Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide 97% protection against the virus. Public health experts emphasize the importance of herd immunity, which requires &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-the-growing-measles-outbreak-and-how-the-trump-administration-is-responding"&gt;95% of the population to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the spread of measles.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text-center banner"&gt;&lt;dfp-slot id="div-gpt-ad-977880" class="mid-ad" ad-type="banner_ad" :ad-unit-index="2"&gt;&lt;/dfp-slot&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/florida/experiences/news/measles-cases-reported-in-south-and-central-florida-2024"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles Cases Increase in Florida&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Should You Do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles. Before traveling, ensure you and your family are up to date on vaccinations. One dose of the vaccine offers 93% protection, while two doses—administered at least 28 days apart—provide 97% protection.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC advises discussing vaccination options with your healthcare provider, “especially if you or your child plan to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak or internationally.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schedule an appointment with your doctor at least six weeks before traveling to allow time for both doses. If vaccination isn’t an option, consider altering your travel plans to avoid exposure. Not only could you become ill, but you could also bring the virus back to your community.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stay informed by monitoring the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe"&gt;CDC’s health notice on measles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the advisory is at Level 1: Practice Usual Precautions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After your trip, monitor your health for three weeks. If you develop symptoms, call your healthcare provider and inform them of your travel history. Do not visit a clinic or hospital without an appointment, as measles is highly contagious and can spread easily.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/did-an-unvaccinated-tourist-reintroduce-measles-to-another-popular-travel-destination"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did an Unvaccinated Tourist Reintroduce Measles to Another Popular Travel Destination?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Baszucki Endowed Chair of Metabolic Neuroscience, professor of biomedical engineering, and director of the Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics (LCNeuro) at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These networks can be observed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5241538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; (functional MRI), which measures blood flow in the brain, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325191" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt; (electroencephalogram), which measures neurons’ activity,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How aging affects the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When these [brain] networks ‘destabilize,’ they become less consistent in their communication patterns over time. Instead of maintaining steady connections, they switch between different configurations, defaulting from ones that are more energy-consuming to those that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7084077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;require less energy&lt;/a&gt; to maintain. This switching behavior may reflect a compensatory strategy by the brain to conserve energy when resources are limited, but also has functional consequences for cognition.”&lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that brain networks degrade in a non-linear way with clear transition points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, they found the effects of the degrading of brain networks is first seen around age 44, with the degeneration hitting peak acceleration around age 67, and then plateauing by age 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, physiological systems are tasked with maintaining homeostasis: in this case, a balance between the cell’s energy demands and their energy supply,” Mujica-Parodi explained. “When physiological systems lose the ability to maintain that balance (i.e., they become ‘dysregulated’), it puts stress on the system. That stress itself further disrupts the balance, which is why chronic diseases often are degenerative — they become worse and worse over time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a point, the system is so disrupted, with so many secondary and tertiary effects, that fixing the original problem no longer helps,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A critical age window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study suggests that, while diminished access to energy is the driving mechanism, seen in the 40’s, eventually, the degenerative effects compound, thereby accelerating a process in the 60’s that sets the trajectory for a path that is harder to reverse. By analogy, we can think of the brain’s neurons like a bustling city. Each building needs a steady supply of electricity to function properly. When the power grid experiences a brief outage, the town goes dark, but once power is restored, everything returns to normal with no lasting damage.” &lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, imagine that same city experiencing a prolonged, severe power outage lasting months. Initially, emergency generators keep essential services running, but eventually, those backups fail,” Mujica-Parodi added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water systems stop working, causing pipes to freeze and burst. Buildings deteriorate without climate control, and infrastructure begins to crumble. By the time power is finally restored, significant structural damage has occurred that simply turning the electricity back on cannot fix. Thus, the significance of our finding is that it’s easier to cure a problem while it’s still small,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this study, Mujica-Parodi and her team also discovered that the primary driver of aging brain networks is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8513144/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;neuronal insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, led by an Alzheimer’s risk factor protein called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9644639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;APOE&lt;/a&gt; and the insulin-dependent glucose transporter &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;GLUT4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, researchers did find that a neuronal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; transporter called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9388117/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MCT2&lt;/a&gt; might provide protection against these drivers of brain network aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons can use two types of fuel for energy: &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; (sugar) and ketones (derived from &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/essential-fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;). Most neurons in the brain primarily use &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9019065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;GLUT3&lt;/a&gt; (not GLUT4) transporters to take up glucose. GLUT4, which is the insulin-responsive glucose transporter found abundantly in muscle and fat tissue, is present in only specific regions of the brain,” Mujica-Parodi detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This limited distribution of GLUT4 in the brain is significant because it means most brain energy metabolism was traditionally thought to be insulin-independent. However, the neuroscience field is gradually discovering that insulin signaling in the brain is more important than previously believed,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking ketones and brain aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When neurons become insulin-resistant, they lose the ability to access glucose as fuel, but not ketones. This means that ketones can function as a ‘back door’ to feeding neurons whose access to glucose would otherwise be blocked by insulin resistance. MCT2 is the primary transporter that enables ketones to enter neurons in the brain. This distribution allows neurons to efficiently uptake ketones when glucose availability is limited, such as during &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; or on a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the presence of MCT2 is essential for the brain’s ability to utilize ketones as an alternative fuel source, which explains why it might be protective as the brain ages.”&lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R.

The drug, now under regulatory review, was greeted as a breakthrough, the closest thing the field has ever had to a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Gilead published early data suggesting a new formulation of the drug  could be used to prevent infection with just a single shot every year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The results are extremely promising,” said Jonathan Li, director of the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research Clinical Core, in an email. “The current lenacapavir twice-yearly formulation is poised to change HIV prevention as we know it and decreasing the dosing to yearly will only improve adherence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00405-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The study, published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, did not actually test efficacy in preventing HIV. Instead, investigators injected two groups of 20 volunteers with two different proposed formulations and took regular blood samples to measure the levels of drug that remained in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they compared those levels to drug levels from volunteers in the two large trials. Sure enough, volunteers who received either new formulation had higher levels of drug in their bloodstream for 56 weeks than volunteers receiving once-every-six-month injections. That suggests the new medicine should provide equal protection. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Howard Gendelman, who develops long-acting antiretrovirals, said the data “shatter a glass ceiling” and could pave a path toward once-yearly medicines for both HIV and other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, Gilead will have to prove it in a much larger study. Jared Baeten, Gilead’s senior vice president of clinical development and virology, said in an interview the company was still reviewing the data to select an optimal formulation and dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company plans to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/11/hiv-prevention-gilead-once-a-year-prep/"&gt;begin a Phase 3 trial&lt;/a&gt; of the once-a-year version this year, but it hasn’t yet determined what that study will look like. Baeten demurred on details but suggested Gilead may be able to run a large single-arm trial, in which they give volunteers the once-a-year treatment, before monitoring them to assure that the formulation is safe and that drug levels remain high enough to offer protection for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re in the process of [figuring out] that design right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gilead will do so as the HIV prevention field faces an uncertain future. Lenacapavir has been broadly hailed as a revolution in pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offering the potential to replace daily pills that have not managed to bring the epidemic to heel. But PrEP has historically been distributed around the world largely through PEPFAR, the George W. Bush-era program for combatting HIV and AIDS around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That program has now been largely dismantled by the Trump administration. A Gilead spokesperson declined to comment on what cuts to PEPFAR will mean for the company’s plans or lenacapavir’s eventual reach. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of those things that’s just changing so quickly,” she said.  “Obviously, we’re watching it closely, but right now, we’re really focused on the studies and the science and the data for the patients to get them into their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
