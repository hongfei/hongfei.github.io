            The combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — better known as the MMR shot —should be split into three separate vaccines, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Director &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1975208317850116544" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O’Neill said&lt;/a&gt; this week. His post on X included similar language &lt;a href="https://x.com/TrumpTruthOnX/status/1971588655669297173" target="_blank"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; by President Donald Trump in late September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This proposal has raised alarms for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/health/mmr-shots-acting-cdc-director"&gt;many public health experts&lt;/a&gt;, who worry that splitting up the shots has no clear scientific justification but would increase the number of health care visits required to get vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella; reduce access to the vaccines; and lead to lower vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000t3b6n4frdk9yn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the MMR combination vaccine shot has been approved in the US since 1971, I wanted to understand more about the diseases the MMR vaccine was designed to prevent and what are advantages and disadvantages of separated shots? Importantly, what could happen if vaccination rates fall, and who would be at highest risk?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000u3b6njp0tesjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000w3b6n34i0e3hw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Many Americans may not have had personal experience with measles, mumps or rubella. What are these diseases and what complications are they associated with?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000x3b6n1vu2ow4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;All three are contagious viruses that, until the development of vaccines, caused serious illness and sometimes death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000y3b6nuzubu8gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the introduction of the measles vaccine, every year, measles led to an estimated 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths, primarily among children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-srinivasan-mmrv-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mumps&lt;/a&gt; can cause &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534785/#:~:text=Mumps%20infection%20typically%20presents%20with,%2C%20encephalitis%2C%20and%20aseptic%20meningitis." target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; include brain swelling, testicular inflammation, infertility and deafness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz000z3b6nxhprvhwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rubella can harm the developing baby if a woman acquires the infection during pregnancy. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increases the risk of&lt;/a&gt; miscarriage and stillbirth. Babies born with congenital rubella syndrome can have serious birth defects including heart, liver and spleen damage, loss of hearing and eyesight and lifelong intellectual disability. According to the CDC, during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-srinivasan-mmrv-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;last major rubella epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in the US, in 1964-65, 11,000 pregnant women lost their babies. More than 2,000 newborns died. About 20,000 were born with congenital rubella syndrome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00103b6n8wt0im4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why was a combination vaccine developed against all three viruses?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00113b6nnqjxlrl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The MMR vaccine was developed to protect against measles, mumps and rubella with a single injection rather than three separate shots. Combining these vaccines streamlines the childhood immunization schedule, reduces the number of doctor visits and needle sticks, and helps ensure that children receive full protection on time. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, one at 12 to 15 months and another at 4 to 6 years old. If they had to have to separate shots, they would require 6 shots instead of 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00123b6nya6fv9w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The combined vaccine has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;extensively studied&lt;/a&gt; and consistently shown to provoke an immune response comparable to what’s seen when the individual vaccines are given separately, and without raising the risk of serious side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00133b6n60gp8j99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are advantages and disadvantages of separated shots?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00143b6n8we8umuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In theory, separating the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines could allow for more flexibility if a family had a specific reason to delay or skip one of the components. Some parents also believe that spreading out shots might reduce the likelihood of side effects such as fever or mild rash, although research has not shown differences in side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00153b6ni7ilhnhh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In practice, separating the vaccines has several drawbacks. It requires multiple clinic visits and more injections, which increases the chance that one or more doses will be delayed or missed. That delay leaves children unprotected for longer periods of time against highly contagious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00163b6njp9nwcyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Furthermore, there is no evidence that the separate vaccines are safer or more effective than the combined MMR shot, and changing the current vaccine schedule adds unnecessary complexity for families and providers. For these reasons, health authorities—including the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC itself&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/measles/measles-vaccine/?srsltid=AfmBOoqKEvCLFVho-FvbyXxMRAHzb8RaPeLe7SXy5KcfUr863FAT_WYg" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;—recommend the combined MMR vaccine as the standard approach for immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00173b6ne1vlhk3z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are separate shots available now if someone chooses to get them?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00183b6nclovhzn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; No, separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella are not currently available in the US. Only the combined MMR vaccine is approved and in use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00193b6ns258tfgx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, has asked manufacturers to begin developing individual vaccines for each virus, but that process will take years. Producing new versions of these vaccines requires not only manufacturing but also rigorous clinical testing to confirm their safety and effectiveness. This will be very challenging when these diseases are now rare thanks to widespread immunization. After that, the vaccines must still go through the full review by the US Food and Drug Administration before they can be offered to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001a3b6nna3jm2jy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many public health experts have questioned the motivation behind this push, noting that the existing MMR vaccine is safe, effective and well-established, and there is no scientific justification for calling for separate shots. Some worry that this proposal could further fuel vaccine hesitancy by reinforcing unfounded fears about combination vaccines and ultimately leading to fewer children receiving timely protection against serious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001b3b6nk087b8fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What could happen if vaccination rates fall, and who would be at highest risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001c3b6nb8r8gwd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;If vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella decline, these diseases can quickly return. When community immunity drops, outbreaks become more frequent and can spread rapidly through schools, households, and entire regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001d3b6nwayej1dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is what has already happened in the US, where vaccination rates have already been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;falling.&lt;/a&gt; In 2025, there have already been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,544&lt;/a&gt; confirmed measles cases. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;highest number&lt;/a&gt; since measles was declared eliminated 25 years ago.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001e3b6nxtsc46j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those most at risk include newborns, who are too young to be vaccinated and among the most medically fragile. People with weakened immune systems are also highly vulnerable. This group includes patients undergoing cancer treatment, transplant recipients and individuals taking immune-suppressing medications. They face a higher likelihood of severe illness if exposed to infections, and vaccines may not protect them as effectively, or may not be safe for them to receive, because their immune systems cannot generate a full response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001f3b6ndjo4vusg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older adults are another group at increased risk. Age-related changes in immunity and chronic health conditions make them more prone to serious complications. In some cases, immunity from prior vaccination may have diminished over time, leaving them more susceptible if vaccine coverage falls and infections spread more widely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001g3b6nifh7q3eu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of community immunity depends on collective participation. When most people stay up to date on their vaccinations, it protects not only themselves but also those around them who are most vulnerable to severe disease and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:20:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFA2TnNZcjhzNHp5cTRHR1FSMUtPZ2tkQnBEMmhQTnBkeGI0MTg0bmlyYzlmbjBoN3Q4YnVHSC0wX2Q5a1RSQ1NOd01qZmI1clk2WTFKUVVubzltbEx2a3VHVjBTaWNsYVJ4dFFqODJHaFktdw</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚逆转了小鼠的阿尔茨海默氏症。他们能在人类身上做到吗？ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/scientists-just-reversed-alzheimers-in-mice-could-they-do-it-in-humans-2000669049</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scientists on Tuesday reported that they had reversed &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/knowing-your-alzheimers-risk-might-change-your-habits-and-not-for-the-better-2000598318"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in mice, a feat that offers hope of a potential cure for the devastating form of dementia in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a paper published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a team of researchers describe how, by harnessing the brain’s garbage disposal system, they managed to repair the brain and reverse the progress of the disease in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, they used nanotechnology to target and restore the brain’s “vascular gatekeeper,” the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from toxins and streamlines blood flow in and out of the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maintenance work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new method came from studying how the buildup of “waste” proteins such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) impairs neuron function. Sometimes, clever solutions to complex problems come from going back to the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Typically, the blood-brain barrier filters out unwanted substances from the brain, but in people with Alzheimer’s, the barrier gets clogged or fails to respond properly to intruders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as Aβ accumulate, disease progresses,” Giuseppe Battaglia, study senior author and a neuroscientist at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, said in a &lt;a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/consiguen-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-ratones-con-el-uso-de-nanoparticulas"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“But once the vasculature is able to function again,” Battaglia said, “it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How they did it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Battaglia and his team developed nanoparticles that mimicked a protein called LRP1, a molecule typically responsible for reacting to toxins in the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers genetically engineered mice to produce more amyloid-beta proteins and to show significant cognitive decline similar to Alzheimer’s. Each mouse received three injections of the new drug, and the researchers observed changes in their behavior and brain activity for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The results were impressive. A 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60 year-old human) that received treatment, when reassessed at 18 months (90 year-old human) old, had “recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse,” the scientists found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” Battaglia said. Surprisingly, the treatment took just three injections for it to reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s in mice, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As with all mice studies, it will take much more work before this treatment could be tested for use in humans. But the results suggest that the approach, which essentially coaxes the brain to return to a healthy state, could hold promise for this incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Individuals who are more prone to disgust are more likely to report symptoms. This is not equivalent to general sensitivity (via &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257409" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trypophobia shares traits with phobias, it often lacks the distress or life impact required for diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5811467/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; notes that many report symptoms similar to specific phobias without meeting all clinical criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without official recognition, people still report genuine anxiety and revulsion. Roughly &lt;strong&gt;10 to 18 percent&lt;/strong&gt; of the population feels some discomfort. Though trypophobia isn’t listed in &lt;strong&gt;DSM-5/DSM-5-TR&lt;/strong&gt;, it continues to be studied (via &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/is-trypophobia-real/769CD2A75D15763730AC524A433BB601" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJPsych Open&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916311783" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt; finds that mild discomfort is a common experience. But by itself, it doesn’t qualify as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why These Patterns Trigger the Brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Why does the brain react so strongly to clustered holes or bumps? Although research is still in development, scientists believe that trypophobia stems from a combination of evolved instincts, visual sensitivities, and learned associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation is the &lt;strong&gt;spectral or visual pattern theory&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1467608/full" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt; explains that specific visual properties, such as mid-range spatial frequencies and high contrast, place unusual demands on the visual system. These patterns may be complex for the brain to process. That difficulty can make them visually uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory centers on &lt;strong&gt;disease-avoidance and evolutionary cues&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.scientia.global/dr-christopher-dimattina-the-mystery-of-trypophobia-why-clusters-of-holes-make-some-peoples-skin-crawl/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr Christopher DiMattina&lt;/a&gt; suggests that hole clusters resemble warning signs of skin disease or parasitic infection. The brain may misidentify these harmless patterns as threats.

Research shows trypophobic images on skin or animals evoke stronger disgust and arousal. That supports the idea that context influences the intensity of reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reactions may be rooted in natural visual discomfort rather than an actual phobia. However, &lt;a href="https://www.emedicinehealth.com/is_trypophobia_skin_real/article_em.htm" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;eMedicineHealth&lt;/a&gt; notes that some people who respond this way also have other mental health conditions.

The most effective approach usually depends on your specific symptoms and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9466900" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9466900" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="17496"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9466900-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

A spokeswoman for the state health department said New Jersey has seen an uptick in recent reported outbreaks of norovirus, an &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/01/this-nasty-stomach-bug-is-spreading-in-nj-health-officials-warn.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;extremely contagious &lt;/a&gt;illness that causes a host of nasty gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TIEGKO3N4VGBDCDJQ4ZTEWBCUQ"&gt;So far in 2025, there’s been a total of 238 outbreaks, according to preliminary state data. By comparison, there were a total of 195 outbreaks reported in 2024. In 2023, 189 outbreaks were reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UTC7HCBFVBDUNFLMC4PVRKVHEA"&gt;Norovirus outbreaks occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April. However, aggressive strains of the virus may be contributing to an earlier onset of the norovirus season, according to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article#;" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article#;"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;What is norovirus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XRGDMZGJHVFSJDOW4X5SYRNW44"&gt;Often called the “stomach flu” or “stomach bug,” norovirus causes painful stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HGFPRQUOERBJ7BDJZTKSWHEHXE"&gt;Unlike other illnesses that may develop over several days or weeks, it “can be abrupt,” said Dr. Stefan Hagmann, section chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Joseph M.

They also boost insulin production, slow digestion and make people feel full longer, helping them slim down in record time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these biological changes can improve health, they may interfere with PET-CT scans, a tool doctors use to detect cancer and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the scare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET-CT scans combine two powerful imaging tools to give doctors a detailed picture of what’s happening in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET scan uses a radioactive substance called FDG that travels through the bloodstream and is absorbed by tissues. Cancer cells and other abnormal cells — like those involved in inflammation — soak up more FDG because they have a higher metabolic rate, according to &lt;a href="https://www.uconnhealth.org/imaging-radiology/services-specialties/pet-ct-scans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UConn Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the FDG, creating images that highlight where the substance has collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Doctors use PET-CT scans to diagnose cancer and inflammatory diseases, in addition to monitoring the effects of treatment. NCPIC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CT scan, meanwhile, provides detailed pictures of organs, bones and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, PET-CT scans reveal the body’s metabolic activity and its physical anatomy, helping doctors make diagnoses and track how patients respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in patients taking GLP-1s, doctors have observed unusual patterns of FDG — i.e, hot spots in the body that can mask signs of cancer or make healthy tissue look diseased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed unusual uptake in one of our patients on a GLP-1 agonist, which prompted a wider review across our network,” &lt;a href="https://www.alliancemedical.co.uk/leaders/dr-peter-strouhal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Peter Strouhal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Peter Strouhal&lt;/a&gt;, medical director at Alliance Medical Ltd in the UK and lead author of the new study, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1100522?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said in a statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these altered patterns are increasingly common, yet there is currently no national or international guidance in the UK addressing this emerging issue,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Confusing scans, costly consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 1 in 8 adults report having used a GLP-1 medication like Ozempic, Wegovy or Mounjaro, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 survey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2024 survey&lt;/a&gt;

A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-025-06792-0" target="_blank"&gt;Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; indicates that long-term ayahuasca users tend to show less fear, anxiety, and avoidance around death—and instead exhibit more acceptance. These effects appear to be driven not by spiritual beliefs or personality traits, but by a psychological attitude known as “impermanence acceptance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from researchers at the University of Haifa, who sought to better understand how psychedelics influence people’s thinking and behavior around mortality. According to their data, it is not belief in an afterlife or a shift in metaphysical views that predicts reduced death anxiety. Instead, the results suggest that learning to accept change and the transient nature of life may be central to how ayahuasca helps people relate more calmly to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew traditionally used by Indigenous Amazonian groups in healing and spiritual rituals. The drink contains the powerful hallucinogen DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) along with harmala alkaloids that make it orally active. Many users describe deeply emotional, and often death-themed, visions during their experiences. These may include the sensation of personal death, symbolic rebirth, contact with deceased individuals, or feelings of ego dissolution—the temporary loss of a sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Jonathan David and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yair-Dor-Ziderman" target="_blank"&gt;Yair Dor-Ziderman&lt;/a&gt;, were interested in this recurring death-related content. Historical records, cultural traditions, and previous studies all suggest that ayahuasca frequently evokes visions or thoughts related to death. In one survey, over half of ayahuasca users said they had experienced what felt like a “personal death” during a session. Others described visions involving graves, spirits, or life-after-death themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these consistent reports, empirical studies that systematically assess how ayahuasca affects death-related cognition and emotion remain rare. Past work has often relied on limited self-reports, lacked control groups, and overlooked possible mediating psychological factors. The current study aimed to address those gaps with a more rigorous design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a hype in popular and scientific venues regarding the efficacy of psychedelics to affect a fundamental shift in our response to the theme of death. In particular, ayahuasca has long been described as the ‘vine of the dead’ (translation from &lt;em&gt;Quechua&lt;/em&gt;) and death-related themes are pervasive in ayahuasca visions,” explained Dor-Ziderman, a research director at the University of Haifa and visiting scholar at Padova University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, there has been surprisingly little empirical work on how such encounters shape one’s relationship with mortality. Furthermore, most existing studies rely on single self-report scales and overlook the unconscious, behavioral, and cognitive layers of how humans process death. We wanted to provide a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment of “death processing,” and to identify the causal mechanisms which mediate, or account for, long-term differences in death processing between ayahuasca users and non-users.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 107 participants: 54 experienced ayahuasca users and 53 non-users. The groups were matched for age, gender, education, and mental health status. None of the non-users had any history of psychedelic use, while the ayahuasca group had used the brew an average of 56 times, often over the span of several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine how these individuals relate to death, the researchers administered a detailed set of questionnaires and behavioral tasks. These included measures of death anxiety, fear of personal death, death-avoidant behaviors, and death acceptance. They also used implicit tasks, such as response times to death-related words, to capture unconscious reactions. The idea was to get a broad, multi-dimensional picture of how people think and feel about mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found statistically significant differences between the two groups. Compared to non-users, ayahuasca users scored lower on death anxiety, were less likely to avoid thinking about death, showed fewer fear responses, and expressed greater acceptance of mortality. These patterns held true across both self-report and behavioral measures. Notably, even the subtle response time tasks pointed in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect sizes were moderate to large, suggesting these differences are not just statistical artifacts. The changes showed up in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domains alike, which the authors interpret as evidence of a generalized shift in how ayahuasca users process the idea of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at several possible explanations for these differences. They examined whether ayahuasca users held stronger beliefs in life after death, which could potentially make them less afraid of dying. They also tested for differences in personality traits, such as openness to experience or neuroticism, and trait mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ayahuasca users did score higher on all of these traits, none of them explained the group differences in death processing. In other words, although ayahuasca users were more open, less neurotic, more mindful, and more likely to believe in some form of existence after death, these factors did not statistically account for their lower death anxiety and higher acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, one psychological variable stood out: impermanence acceptance. This concept refers to an attitude of openness toward the fact that all things—including life itself—are temporary. People who score high on impermanence acceptance tend to feel less distressed by change and more at ease with the idea that nothing lasts forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analyses indicated that this variable alone explained the differences in death-related responses between ayahuasca users and non-users. In statistical terms, impermanence acceptance “carried the effect” of ayahuasca use on death anxiety, avoidance, and acceptance. Even after controlling for gender differences, this relationship remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, simple awareness of impermanence—knowing that things change—was not enough to predict lower death anxiety. It was the emotional acceptance of this fact, rather than intellectual acknowledgment, that seemed to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results were more decisive than we expected,” Dor-Ziderman told PsyPost. “We anticipated ayahuasca users to fear death less, but we did not anticipate that impermanence acceptance—and not afterlife beliefs or personality—would emerge as the key mediator in all of the death processing indices we examined. That even self-identified materialists showed the same pattern, which challenges the common idea that psychedelic comfort with death depends on adopting metaphysical beliefs. This last point is important as it suggests that psychedelics can be beneficial regardless of ontological beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored what aspects of ayahuasca experiences might shape this attitude toward impermanence. The researchers looked at various factors, including frequency of use, age at first use, and how recently participants had taken the substance. None of these usage patterns predicted impermanence acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one aspect of the ayahuasca experience did: ego dissolution. Participants who reported stronger episodes of ego dissolution—where their usual sense of self faded or broke down—also tended to score higher on impermanence acceptance. This suggests that certain acute, subjective experiences during ayahuasca sessions may help reorient people’s attitudes toward change and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors speculate that temporarily losing one’s sense of a fixed identity may help the brain “train” for death in a psychological sense. The mind may learn that even its most stable perceptions—like the boundaries of the self—are not permanent. This realization may generalize to a broader understanding of impermanence and eventually reduce existential fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who regularly engage in ayahuasca ceremonies show a quieter, less defended relationship with death: less fear and anxiety of death, less suppression of death-related thoughts, and less behavioral avoidance of real-life death-related encounters,” Dor-Ziderman explained. “However, what really stood out was that this difference in death processing wasn’t due to personality, mindfulness, or ontological afterlife beliefs—it was explained by impermanence acceptance, the felt understanding that everything changes and passes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests—unlike what is commonly believed in the literature—that it’s not belief in an afterlife that softens death anxiety, but rather the experiential embrace of transience itself. Finally, we found that impermanence acceptance was correlated with the strength of ego dissolution experienced during ayahuasca ceremonies. So ego dissolution experiences induce an acceptance of impermanence which, in turn, mediates how our mind-brain addresses its mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like all research, this study has limitations. It was cross-sectional, meaning it captured a snapshot in time rather than tracking changes over time. This makes it difficult to determine causality. It is possible, for example, that people who are already more accepting of death are more drawn to ayahuasca. Longitudinal studies would help clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size, while reasonable, was relatively small. Also, while participants were carefully selected to isolate the effects of ayahuasca, many had also tried other psychedelics, such as psilocybin or LSD, which may have influenced the results. And because the sample consisted of healthy, experienced users, the findings may not generalize to first-time users or those with psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another question is whether these changes apply only to ayahuasca, or whether similar effects would appear with other psychedelics. The authors are already running a follow-up study with psilocybin users, and preliminary results suggest a similar pattern, pointing toward a broader effect across psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to acknowledge that the sample size of the study was relatively small (a little more than 100 participants overall), and like any other study—results need to be replicated,” Dor-Ziderman told PsyPost. “In the this regard we can already report that we are currently working on a replication study, this time with psilocybin (magic mushrooms) users, and it appears our results replicate. That our results replicate to an independent sample which consume a different psychedelic indicates that our results are solid, and furthermore, that they relate to psychedelics in general and not just ayahuasca.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, our effect sizes were moderate to large, and consistent across both explicit and implicit measures of death processing. These group changes show up in attitudes, emotions, and behavior alike. This coherence suggests a genuine restructuring in how mortality is represented and felt, rather than a temporary mood or belief shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now studying how experiences like ego dissolution during psychedelic use or meditation affect the brain’s way of understanding the self over time. Their goal is to find out whether these experiences can help the brain become more flexible with the idea of change, including the reality of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a new study coming out (the preprint can be accessed here: &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/my9sd_v1" target="_blank"&gt;https://osf.io/preprints/osf/my9sd_v1&lt;/a&gt;) where we show that despite the results shared above—a more ‘relaxed’ death processing system in long-term ayahuasca users, there seems to be a limit to the transformative potential of ayahuasca,” Dor-Ziderman added. “We administered to these same participants &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31401240/)" target="_blank"&gt;an electrophysiological visual mismatch response task&lt;/a&gt; that indexes an unconscious death-denial mechanism operating at millisecond resolution, categorizing death as relating to others but not to one self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results indicated that in this regard, ayahuasca users were no different that healthy controls—their denial mechanism seemed to be intact. This finding was somewhat surprising as &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2025/1/niaf002/8046166" target="_blank"&gt;in another study&lt;/a&gt; we found that long-terms meditators’ brains did evidence a shift from death denial to acceptance, and our initial assumption was that self/ego-dissolution (which both populations experienced) were the causal mechanism. So there is something to be said for training the mind and arriving at certain experiences rather than taking pharmacological ‘shortcuts’—at least in regard to deeply rooted long-term effects. However, we are still investigating this and are seeking to replicate these findings, so stay tuned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-025-06792-0" target="_blank"&gt;Embracing change: impermanence acceptance mediates differences in death processing between long-term ayahuasca users and non-users&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jonathan David, Aviva Berkovich-Ohana, and Yair Dor-Ziderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:11:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNUk1pOThFU1l4cVYxczFmLVM5TFhReUs0Q0RYZ2w5SWE4RzBrbV9WaDlKVzRXcmpaS1VsZEliZFpHYlJxTXU5NWg2bWRiSGhCWDFBMmJYTkFmdWdxaS1ZZ2RXZk55b0VVTHZxTXd0RkJDLVNPb1RYMWZDMlFSQmlQZ1Y2b19SQzhOWHB4UUJxTFhCUzhhdkZoVExRcDkzcnNL</guid></item><item><title>您的早晨咖啡可能会在您不知情的情况下破坏您的处方药- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/morning-coffee-could-sabotaging-prescription-221948612.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, the day doesn’t start until &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee does.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee does.&lt;/a&gt; But if you take prescription drugs or supplements, that caffeine hit might do more than perk you up: it can alter how your body absorbs medication, amplify side effects or dull a drug’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/energy-drinks-face-restrictions-abroad-could-us-next-line" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Energy Drinks Face New Restrictions Abroad: Could The Us Be Next In Line?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Energy Drinks Face New Restrictions Abroad: Could The Us Be Next In Line?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how caffeine interacts with different types of medications, and how to time your coffee to stay in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Pairing coffee with drugs that influence the cardiovascular system can create unwanted overlap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine itself raises heart rate and blood pressure temporarily, so pairing it with drugs that influence the cardiovascular system can create unwanted overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can affect how blood clots in the same way blood thinners do.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-signs-fall-covid-shots-may-not-easy-get-one-depending-live-rcna233418" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced&lt;/a&gt; that it recommends Covid shots for the same groups, based on people’s own decision-making or conversations with their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd2180" class="body-graf"&gt;The change has created hurdles for people who want the shots but don’t obviously fit into either category — especially parents who want their infants or toddlers vaccinated. But for the most part, it hasn’t prevented adults from getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-507414" class="body-graf"&gt;Younger adults must now attest either online or in person at pharmacies that they have health conditions that qualify them for the vaccine. The CDC’s list of conditions is broad — it includes pregnancy, physical inactivity, being overweight, mental health conditions and a history of smoking. So many adults seeking shots say it’s easy to find something that describes them or to stretch the truth without pushback.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6229e7" class="body-graf"&gt;CVS’ and Walgreens’ websites simply prompt people to confirm that they’re eligible before they book appointments and offer an option to learn more about the CDC’s list of risk factors. A prescription isn’t required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59fe33" class="body-graf"&gt;Bobby McClanahan, 37, of Columbus, Ohio, said he signed up for a vaccination appointment on the CVS website about two weeks ago even though he didn’t think he had any underlying conditions that would put him at risk of severe Covid. If necessary, he was prepared to say he had asthma, even though he doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04852d" class="body-graf"&gt;But the website didn’t ask for specifics — he merely agreed to the terms and conditions and was able to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2faba3" class="body-graf"&gt;The pharmacist was enthusiastic that he was there, McClanahan said: “She just told me to encourage people to come in and get a vaccine booster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-593e75" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and the chief medical officer at the Association of Immunization Managers, said that per the CDC criteria, “the majority of Americans would actually qualify to get a Covid-19 vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2ff73" class="body-graf"&gt;Insurance plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;private plans&lt;/a&gt;, Medicare and Medicaid — still largely cover Covid shots. McClanahan said he had no trouble getting his provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce2673" class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m walking out of CVS and I opened my Blue Cross Blue Shield app on my phone and the claim was already there, showing that I owed nothing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfd2c" class="body-graf"&gt;However, vaccinating infants and toddlers is proving more challenging, since their shots are typically administered in doctors’ offices, which have less consistent supplies than pharmacies. Walgreens offers Covid vaccinations only for kids ages 3 and up, and CVS’ minimum age is 5 years. (Some states, such as Kansas and Illinois, have even higher age requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-660985" class="body-graf"&gt;Several pediatricians told NBC News that they are still vaccinating healthy children because of the CDC language that allows for shared decision-making between doctors and patients. In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics continues to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;recommend Covid vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; for all babies ages 6 to 23 months, along with older kids who are at high risk of severe disease or haven’t had Covid shots before. (Parents can choose to get healthy children boosters this year if they desire, according to the AAP.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f404ed" class="body-graf"&gt;“I really agree with the AAP language, saying that anybody that wants a Covid vaccine for their child should be able to get one,” said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, an attending physician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebc719" class="body-graf"&gt;Samantha Cramer, the mother of a 2-year-old in Kissimmee, Florida, said she went on a wild goose chase to find a vaccination for her daughter, Alice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a03c25" class="body-graf"&gt;Pharmacies weren’t an option, and the family’s pediatrician didn’t have the specialized refrigeration to store the shots, Cramer said. Calls to her local health clinic and a major hospital system in the area revealed neither were offering Covid shots to toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03a949" class="body-graf"&gt;Cramer and her husband considered traveling to Georgia to get Alice vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-076d0f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We were just like, ‘Do you want to take a trip up to a state that’s chill about this? Do we need to go out of state to get her vaccinated?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd1965" class="body-graf"&gt;In a last-ditch effort, Cramer asked for advice on Reddit. A user recommended MinuteClinics — health clinics inside CVS pharmacies that vaccinate kids ages 18 months and up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7329b" class="body-graf"&gt;Cramer tried three locations: One wasn’t accepting walk-ins, and another said the pediatric vaccine was out of stock, but Alice was finally vaccinated at the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-30f2cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The choice to not vaccinate is infinitesimally easier now than it is to vaccinate,” Cramer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a141dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The reason some pediatric hospitals don’t have updated Covid vaccines available yet is that they waited for the CDC’s final recommendations before they ordered them. The agency took two weeks to formally adopt the guidance determined by its &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-eligibility-limit-over-65-health-conditions-cdc-rcna232374" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory committee&lt;/a&gt;. (Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired the panel’s previous 17 members in June&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently appointed 12 new members, many of whom have expressed skepticism about Covid vaccines.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea7376" class="body-graf"&gt;The final CDC guidance paved the way for shots to be distributed through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free shots for uninsured or underinsured kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cf510" class="body-graf"&gt;Nemours Children’s Health — a pediatric hospital network with locations in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida — was one of the health systems that delayed its Covid vaccine rollout until the CDC recommendation came out. Dr. Matthew Davis, Nemours’ enterprise physician-in-chief, said the network should receive doses soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3e43a" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I’m confident that parents and guardians who want to vaccinate their kids against Covid-19 will be able to do so,” he said. “There are some additional steps in terms of counseling around shared decision-making and documentation, but those steps shouldn’t be a full barrier to kids getting vaccinated when their parents and guardians make the choice to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNdkhfNE9YeG1TLUFkVWVBQ1Roc2NkeGhrSjNCWWMwNzFNaWptQWlCbkZadmRXdW53QkNqcFhqTzFpVmQ4ekY2SmZJbVRyUGRGS096NDZWWUlWSEJtRmx1bzZrS3hvYlczMElKMnNic1J3dEoxbjVTbXpqWjBDTUl6LU1ITlg1OE03V0tTdnQxUG9rOU53eVHSAVZBVV95cUxPR1ZyVkZFYXdWWnZfRHVDYmpOSTdWeUlDRjBMLUZkbXZIN2taV091eDBDTmZVc0VreG9Rc1pQc1Vfd180UU1ndExQNVowSnZubnlFRFo2QQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心关于新冠肺炎疫苗接种的最新消息- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/local/2025/10/getting-covid-19-shots-what-recent-cdc-updates/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;The CDC now recommends COVID-19 vaccination through shared clinical decision-making, emphasizing informed consent and personalized discussions with healthcare providers, including pharmacists. Most insurance plans are expected to continue covering the vaccine without requiring a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The most recent recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on COVID-19 vaccines call for “vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/cdc-immunization-schedule-adopts-individual-based-decision.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Informed consent is back,” Acting Director and Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neil said. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the nonpartisan health policy organization KFF, explained the CDC is recommending that “there should be an interaction between the individual and a provider” when a COVID-19 vaccination is being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean that patients have to scramble to go to a primary care doctor’s office, she said, but it could create an “extra step” for patients who want to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A provider is defined broadly. That could be your pharmacist, it doesn’t have to be your primary care doctor. You don’t have to get a doctor’s visit in most states,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, Kates said, is that, “You should be able to go to your pharmacist and have the pharmacist talk with you and then decide through that shared discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key may be how pharmacists or insurance providers interpret the updated language in the CDC’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kates said when it comes to insurance coverage, “The requirement under federal law is that any ACIP-recommended — that’s the advisory committee — and CDC-adopted recommendation on vaccines has to be covered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would include private insurance along with Medicare and Medicaid, Kates said. Most large insurance companies have stated they would continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines “at least for the foreseeable future,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Maryland, for example, Sean O’Donnell, with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, explained: “The Maryland Department of Health has issued a statewide COVID-19 vaccination standing order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That authorizes qualified health care professionals to follow the most current, evidence-based guidelines as standards,” O’Donnell said. “In Maryland, that also means that a prescription is not required to get the COVID-19 vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Dillon, a spokesperson for CVS, said their pharmacists will take part in the decision-making with patients. She said that will consist of simple conversations between the patient and pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a patient requests the vaccine, they will be administered it,” Dillon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dillon also said its their understanding that most insurance plans will cover the cost of vaccinations for eligible patients and that prescriptions are not required, but they should check with their insurer to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is ‘all in their head’. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition – and we did. Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists at UEA and Oxford Biodynamics (OBD) looked at how DNA was folded in patients diagnosed with the condition, which could provide tell-tale signs of ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They examined blood samples from 47 patients with severe ME/CFS and 61 healthy adults. The team discovered a unique pattern that appears consistently in people with ME/CFS that is not seen in healthy people, enabling them to develop the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the Journal of Translational Medicine, they said the test had a sensitivity – or the likelihood of a test being positive if that patient has the condition – of 92%. It had a specificity – the probability the test will rule out negative cases – of 98%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pshezhetskiy added: “This is a significant step forward, for the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS – potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alexandre Akoulitchev, the chief scientific officer at OBD, which funded and co-authored the research, said: “Chronic fatigue syndrome is not a genetic disease you’re born with, that’s why using EpiSwitch ‘epigenetic’ markers – which can change during a person’s life, unlike fixed genetic code – was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, other experts called for more studies to confirm the finding, and for the test to be assessed among a wider population of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charles Shepherd, medical adviser for the ME Association, said: “These results, using epigenetic profiling, appear to be an important step forward in the search for a diagnostic blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“However, as the researchers point out, a diagnostic blood test has to be both highly sensitive and specific to that condition. In this case, we therefore need to know whether the abnormality is consistently present in the very early stages of ME/CFS as well as in people with longstanding disease who have mild or moderate ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also need to know that, in addition to the abnormality not being present in healthy controls, it is also not present in a range of other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that cause ME/CFS-like symptoms and form part of the differential diagnosis of ME/CFS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Chris Ponting, chair of medical bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh, said some of the claims made by the research team were “premature”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said: “This test needs to be fully validated in better-designed and independent studies before it is considered for clinical application. Even if validated, the test will be expensive, likely (about) £1,000.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxPM3FwS1p0ZXk2dkp4dmJXMXNzX3Bha0s5dE90TGNRb3ZXZk8zZ3NwT1l5RjlXU0RoSmlSOUdweUdWN0xJa2tVbTNxQ3FkV2phblgzQTk1TWIxNFRPeVhSOWJwRnh6T0E0N2FsUno4VWxwV29ZOVFKMXNTUnlKZXhYb0ZYRG5qVWxaS1JhOE5VcE1iVkhaMXdxQXdPN2I4RjBiMVhCcFc0Mzh0eFhDMkc0QXgzLTNaTmt6TFQ3UDJWYThhcjROTXNyXw</guid></item><item><title>顶级神经外科医生警告说，痴呆症始于腿部-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/dementia-starts-in-your-legs-top-neurosurgeon-warns/articleshow/124375631.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is the leading cause of disability and dependency among older adults globally. In &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, 57 million people had dementia worldwide, and every year, nearly 10 million new cases arise. While most of us believe keeping the brain sharp is key to preventing or reducing the risk of dementia, a leading neurosurgeon reveals that keeping the legs strong is crucial. Dr. Arun L. Naik, a neurosurgeon trained at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), India, explains that dementia starts in the leg! “Dementia may start in your legs, not your brain,” he said. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is dementia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. It is a progressive neurological condition, which means it worsens with age and severely affects the quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dementia starts in the leg &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did you know dementia starts in your legs? Physical inactivity weakens your leg muscles, leading to sarcopenia, a loss of muscle mass. But here is the shocking part. Studies show that weak legs can speed up cognitive decline and increase dementia risk. Because active muscles pump out powerful chemicals that boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These chemicals are called brain-derived neurotrophic factors, BDNF, which increase connections in your memory area called the hippocampus. Strong legs mean strong balance and zero falls as you age. Falls are dangerous after the age of 65,” Dr. Naik said in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMecvpSxzvu/?igsh=dnc5cTVyMXgyOW50" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shared on Instagram &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which do you think is more important for preventing dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor pointed at a 2020 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7244966/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Neurology, which found that slower walking speed in older adults was linked to smaller brain volume and a higher risk of cognitive decline. “Why? Because walking is not just a physical task, it’s a full-brain workout,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking protects the brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, which is one of the simplest forms of exercise, has many health benefits, including improved brain health. Speaking about the brain–leg connection, the neurosurgeon said, “Every step involves coordination between the frontal lobe, cerebellum, spinal cord, and proprioceptive feedback loops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking also boosts circulation. “Leg movement improves blood flow to the brain, delivering oxygen, glucose, and clearing out toxins,” Dr. Naik said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Britney Spears Reveals Knee Injury After Fall, Says It ‘Snapped Out’ But She’s Still Dancing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gait Changes = Brain Warning. Changes in walking style, balance, or pace often precede memory symptoms by years,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor added that walking is neuroplasticity in motion. “Walking stimulates BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which strengthens neuron connections,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How prevent dementia and protect your brain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Naik also shared effective strategies that can prevent dementia through movement and improve brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily walk: Walk 30 minutes daily at a brisk pace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add balance exercises like tandem walking and single-leg stands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice dual-task walking (e.g., walking while talking or solving a simple mental task).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include strength training for lower limbs, muscle is cognitive insurance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid long periods of sitting; movement every hour keeps memory sharp.&lt;br&gt;        &lt;p type="Article" hostid="83" msid="118487882" title="Walking 40 minutes can boost your memory power for better" mstype="2" mssubtype="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your legs slow down, your brain may follow. Protect your gait—protect your grey matter,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with movement, the doctor recommends eating protein-rich food to maintain muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurosurgeon also emphasized that it is never too late. “Studies have shown that it's never too late to start. Starting even at 60s have shown to reduce dementia by a mile. Remember, strong legs, sharp brain. Don't wait till sarcopenia hits your brain. Start in your 40s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 03:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5gFBVV95cUxNbnVvSS1jaVBJQUpiR0dRaE53anIyZ09SZGJhQW50UTRfeEVZSDNuMU1aX3d5UXRTMTU4cDhIZjdZcU1xQ2NVY0tzYkRlQUdiQ091aUJVSEZhdk1wR0NhOHRQeGpINzR1UXgwdUhvVGM2SDh3emgyNkp0N2J3VVhoVHE5WXh3ZG9OM3FMUUx6dWFsY0RMa0lmbmFwVGpBbklCRmd0bTZaQW1jT1JrN29CamlpNW1DVDRqTktSWXlyeUk1b09VbmtDRWpSWXhSbEJkMGtTYUw0Tjd2RjBTMzVLdGZwcVlTQQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家了解到，记忆储存在身体的其他部位，而不仅仅是大脑中- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/memory-is-stored-by-spacing-signals-in-other-body-parts-not-just-brain-neurons/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been told that many short study sessions beat one long, all-night “cramming” marathon. That basic idea – called the signal spacing effect – shows up again and again in memory research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the twist: signs of this memory spacing effect don’t stop at the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-the-human-brain-create-retrieve-memories-engram-cells-connections/"&gt;neurons in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprising lab study reveals that spacing out chemical signals also boosts both the strength and the memory of the response in everyday normal human cells, not just in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, as with memory stored in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/neurons-can-predict-human-speech-before-we-say-a-word/"&gt;brain’s neurons&lt;/a&gt;, the pattern and the timing of the signals also matter for memory in other human cell types. Cellular responses to spaced burst signals last longer, even when the total signal is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that the same “learning rules” that apply for students in the classroom also apply down at the molecular level – an incredible concept, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-spaced-signals-and-memory"&gt;Studying spaced signals and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; grew non-neural human cells in dishes and gave them a built-in “reporter” that briefly glows when a certain gene switches turn on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reporter used a short-lived form of firefly luciferase, which is controlled by a DNA element called a cAMP response element (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cyclic-amp-responsive-element-binding-protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CREB&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the protein CREB is activated, the glow rises and then fades quickly, so the signal reports what’s happening now, not what happened earlier. Think of it like a live scoreboard for whether the cell’s “learning” machinery is currently engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, they needed a way to “train” the cells. In animals, certain chemicals, like the neurotransmitter serotonin, can trigger the molecular cascades that help form long-term memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two lab tools that hit parts of those same cascades: forskolin, which boosts a signaling pathway that activates an enzyme called protein kinase A (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PKA&lt;/a&gt;), and a phorbol ester called TPA, which activates another enzyme called protein kinas C (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PKC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those alphabet soups – CREB, PKA, PKC – are all proteins that pass messages inside cells and ultimately influence genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can think of them as messengers that carry a beat from the outside world into the cell’s control room, where &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-genes-may-predict-infertility-and-disease-by-flipping-like-a-light-switch/"&gt;DNA decisions get made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spaced-signals-vs-massed-signals"&gt;Spaced signals vs. massed signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists gave the cells one big “massed” pulse of signal, the reporter lit up. But when they gave the cells several short pulses spaced by short breaks – four quick hits, separated by minutes – the glow was stronger and lasted longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory spacing effect held whether the scientists used the PKA route, the PKC route, or both. The cells weren’t just counting the total dose – they were reading the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That behavior matches what &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brain-keeps-making-new-neurons-even-in-old-age/"&gt;memory studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown in animals and people for more than a century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This reflects the massed-space effect in action,” says Kukushkin, a clinical associate professor of life science at NYU Liberal Studies and a research fellow at NYU’s &lt;a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/cns.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Neural Science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows that the ability to learn from spaced repetition isn’t unique to brain cells, but, in fact, might be a fundamental property of all cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In study after study, well-timed events can drive more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spacing-effect-spaced-learning-long-term-impact-on-memory/"&gt;durable memory changes&lt;/a&gt; than one long exposure. In cells, that “durable change” shows up as a longer-lasting boost in gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like “learning,” that’s because at the molecular level, it kind of is. Learning in neurons depends on waves of activity that feed into CREB, which then turns on sets of genes that change how cells behave for hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spacing-signal-patterns-and-memory"&gt;Spacing signal patterns and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biochemical circuits normal cells carry can integrate pulses over time and give a bigger, longer-lasting response to spaced signals than to massed signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, to figure out how this process actually works, the researchers looked upstream of CREB at another key player, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/extracellular-signal-regulated-kinases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ERK&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a protein kinase known to pulse in response to stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that spaced stimulation produced stronger and more sustained activation of ERK and CREB than massed stimulation did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team blocked ERK or interfered with CREB, the spacing advantage disappeared. That result ties the effect to the same molecular players that have always been linked to long-term memory in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-implications"&gt;Real-world implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it matter? Because this discovery completely reframes “learning” as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/variable-learning-the-key-to-more-effective-study-habits/"&gt;not only a brain trick&lt;/a&gt;, but also as a general principle of how cells process information over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells aren’t just on/off machines; they notice patterns – the number of pulses, the spacing between them – and they make computations with those patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That idea has practical uses. Researchers and clinicians often focus on how much of a drug to give. Dose matters, but schedule can matter just as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, smaller amounts delivered in pulses could push cells toward stronger or more useful gene responses than a single large dose. Timing, therefore, becomes a real-world design tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As thorough as this research was, there are always limitations to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used immortalized human cell lines, engineered “reporters,” and controlled stimuli. Real tissues juggle many signals at once and include feedback from nearby cells and the immune system. That complexity can shape how timing plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even with those limits, these dish experiments highlight a clear point: you can see spacing rules inside single cells without any wiring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That helps isolate which steps carry the timing information and suggests clear follow-ups, like testing different intervals, pulse numbers, or combinations of pathways in primary cells and organoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spacing-memory-and-human-cells"&gt;Spacing, memory, and human cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, these scientists found that four short, properly spaced chemical pulses trigger stronger and more durable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-hidden-dark-genes-discovered-in-humans/"&gt;gene activation&lt;/a&gt; than one longer pulse in human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “spacing effect” lines up with higher, longer activation of ERK and CREB – two molecular players already known to be crucial for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/creating-lasting-memories-damages-dna-brain-cells/"&gt;memory in neurons&lt;/a&gt; – and blocking ERK or CREB erases the advantage of spacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacing isn’t just a study habit. It’s a principle written into cell signaling. When signals arrive in well-timed bursts, cells can lock in a stronger, longer-lasting response than they do after one massed burst hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Learning and memory are generally associated with brains and brain cells alone, but our study shows that other cells in the body can learn and form memories, too,” explains New York University’s Nikolay V. Kukushkin, the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kukushkin and his team proved that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-better-way-for-kids-to-learn-math/"&gt;hallmarks of learning&lt;/a&gt; don’t require a brain or even a neuron – they can emerge from the timing-dependent dynamics of signaling networks that many cell types share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could help scientists build better models of memory, design smarter drug-dosing schedules, and explore “cellular cognition” as a broader biological principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53922-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 01:44:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNNi1EVlU5M2dvWFFNbVVfMmtCVjVnYnktb3FXSzZXN0ZVcTJPbU90cHVNSFR0ZXFrWlpXcUt4TUlhOEJoUjFPSFNXaXlUZjNzakxjVlN1aXlZNlV4TjhRdlZ1cUc2b01kU2hFSHVIX3dERGs0ZnBsQkhBZzFMYUZnUmhBNnlqZ3YtUUdyR1d3RzlOWUlXS2NLRmZ3bDczRVBBek9JWlBtTkQ0Zw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家列举了可能导致致命的主动脉瘤的常见习惯： “这是喷气燃料……它会让你生病” --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15168561/common-habits-cause-aortic-aneurism.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading cardiologist has warned that some everyday habits could be silently putting people at risk of developing a deadly aortic aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a board-certified cardiologist from Scarsdale, New York, has shared a viral Instagram post revealing ten common behaviours he sees regularly contributing to aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous ballooning of the body's main artery. If it bursts, it can cause massive internal bleeding and sudden death, often without warning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From gym routines to popular medications, many of the risky activities are things most people might not think twice about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are all things I see over and over again in my patients,' Dr Levine told his 92,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some risk factors are genetic, Dr Levine stressed that many are self-inflicted. And for him, there's one clear offender that tops the list, and that's taking cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It's] just jet fuel. It's a drug to drive the aorta larger [and] it sickens you - don't ever do it,' he said in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNmirLdNu8C/https://www.instagram.com/p/DNmirLdNu8C/"&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even occasional use can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure that put immense strain on artery walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading US cardiologist, Dr Evan Levine, has warned that some everyday habits could be silently putting people at risk of developing a deadly aortic aneurysm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But cocaine isn't the only vice wreaking havoc on arteries, with Dr Levine describing smoking as 'cocaine light', as it drives up blood pressure, damages arteries and causes cholesterol build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And for those who have switched to e-cigarettes and vapes, his message is still a firm no as they're all as bad as each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even seemingly 'healthy' behaviours can become risky under the wrong circumstances. Intense heavy lifting, for example, can rapidly spike blood pressure and stress the aorta, particularly in older gym-goers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not talking about good quality resistance exercises,' he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the dude in the corner of the gym who's screaming out his lungs to get the 400lb weight up, it's not good.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medications are another overlooked risk with Dr Levine warning that overusing fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin can weaken the inside of blood vessels and make them more prone to aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thank you for bringing up fluoroquinolone antibiotics,' one grateful follower commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most doctors let alone patients don't even know how dangerous they are and that they should only be used as a last resort.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An aortic aneurysm is a deadly swelling of the main artery, often fatal if it bursts. While genetics play a role, Dr Levine says many risks are self-inflicted - with cocaine the worst culprit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also increasingly concerned about the long-term use of stimulant medications like Adderall and Ritalin, often prescribed for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm seeing people in their 40s with unexplained enlarged aortas and the first thing I do is check what meds they're on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Too often those drugs can increase your blood pressure and increase the risk of aneurysm. Only take them if you need to, and not for decades.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, many people have wound up in cardiology clinics after following  medical misinformation spread online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine is alarmed by the number of patients abruptly quitting statins or blood pressure medication because of what they've seen on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statins reduce the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and increase the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He even warns that ‘healthy’ habits like heavy lifting can be risky, as they may spike blood pressure and strain the aorta, especially for older gym-goers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that quitting stations will 'increase your cholesterol, inflammation and increase your risk of aneurysms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, he warned against avoiding blood pressure tablets because of outdated ideas that it's 'normal' for pressure to rise with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was thought about 60 years ago, [and] it's wrong.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine also warns about lifestyle habits that gradually erode cardiovascular health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heavy drinking raises blood pressure and triglycerides and increases the risk of aneurysms, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A junk food-heavy diet, loaded with salt and calories, contributes to obesity and hypertension, compounding the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And surprisingly, even not eating enough fibre can play a role too, with resultant constipation and straining during bowel movements increasing aneurysm risk and even triggering ruptures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seriousness of the condition hit home for one follower, who shared her health scare at just 21 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was completely perfectly healthy with zero health conditions and I had an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.

His mother also said the drug, which she blamed for his mental health struggles, led to his suicide, though no formal connection has ever been made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride was approved to treat male hair loss in 1997 and is now prescribed to an estimated 7.5million people every year, almost all men. (The drug is not approved for women, but may be prescribed off-label for female hair loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been taken by celebrities including Elon Musk, and is even rumored to have been used by President Donald Trump to combat his hair loss, though this has never been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA first added depression as a possible side effect of taking finasteride in 2011, and updated the label in 2022 to add suicidal behaviors, though researchers had raised concerns over a potential link as early as 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the monitoring system FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), shows nearly 300 suicides among people who took the drug between 1993 and 2025, along with 111 suicide attempts and six suspected suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FAERS system is not verified, and claims can be submitted by anyone. It also only highlights correlations, which do not necessarily prove that any drug directly caused a side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest scientific review, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/analytical-review-depression-suicidality-finasteride/"&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; last month, the researchers warned the drug may have caused 'hundreds of thousands' of cases of depression and hundreds of suicides since it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paper reviewed four studies that analyzed suicide reports among finasteride users from multiple adverse events reporting systems, such as the FDA's FAERS, and four studies that analyzed healthcare records to determine whether finasteride raised the risk of suffering from depression or other mental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It included a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319231/"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by Canadian researchers that analyzed data on 93,000 men who started taking finasteride between 2003 to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That research warned those on the drug had an 88 percent higher risk of being diagnosed with depression within the first 18 months of starting on the drug. It did not find a higher risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Millich, pictured above on the right, has said previously that he suffered from mental health problems and saw changes in his genitals after taking finasteride&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also analyzed a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39138902/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 50,000 men with hair loss, including 23,300 who were prescribed finasteride. Results showed patients who took the drug were 40 percent more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression than those who did not use the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paper concludes: 'Current evidence shows that finasteride use can cause depression and suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The lesson is that before approving a medication for the market, regulators should require manufacturers to commit to performing and disclosing ongoing post-approval analytical studies, and this requirement needs to be enforced.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review, however, disclosed that it had significant limitations, including the chance the large databases researchers used could potentially contain errors and poor data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor dataset contains errors, gaps or inconsistencies, for example, incorrect birth dates or missing fields. It may also be one where users changed how they recorded information over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also noted that the suggestion in their paper that finasteride could have caused hundreds of suicides was 'highly speculative' and said that more research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride works by blocking an enzyme that converts testosterone into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is linked to hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical information from the FDA estimates that more than one in 100 people who take the drug experience problems getting an erection, a lower libido and problems with ejaculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Finasteride does carry a warning suggesting that it could be linked to suicide on its label&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one in 1,000 people, the drug has been linked to swelling and tenderness in the chest and low mood, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an update in 2022, the FDA added a warning to the drug's label over a potential link to suicides, with the label now including under the section side effects: 'Nervous system/Psychiatric: Depression, suicidal ideation and behavior'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its manufacturer, Merck, told Reuters in 2021 that the scientific evidence 'does not support' a 'causal link' between finasteride and suicides or suicidal thoughts, adding that these terms 'should not be included in the labeling'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It continued: 'Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia [finasteride].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail contacted Merck ahead of the publication of this article for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 49,000 Americans die by suicide every year, which is the second leading cause of death among adults aged 10 to 34 years old. About 80 percent of suicides recorded every year are in men, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:37:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQTTIyZUlLQ2pGdUh4UVI1aXFhMGdNN0R0LTlvVF9uNlFOSUlBTWtreFpQOVJSRUh4cE9nQVI4aUJnbWs4SzFTbUgxTkVsNGhpWEV0N2NWUk9UQmRjbnJxY3FfZ2d2eVY0MHp4NlhsbVNHcHNZSjZyRDgwdU5Na1hsU2FCQ3paNGI4d1hRbGhOS21ZbTdoRkxr0gGcAUFVX3lxTFBHV3hpMUNqTHFGUV9tWFNvU0Z2aGVPdk82TUxERl8wOWRQVU5hcGdvRWhONHRaWEJxWVowWE9XRUF5QkN1MklYTENVYzBDUTNIcEZvakpJelA2TklDMzdEbWtxY0NpYi1VTUpjbExpVEFaMXBFNE9ab0RsU3ZwZHJ6NVJQQXA1X3h4Mzg1X0dCTEdTVHBaZDRwb0FvaQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心代理主任表示要打破MMR射击- The Hill</title><link>https://thehill.com/newsletters/health-care/5544062-acting-cdc-director-says-to-break-up-mmr-shot/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;There is no research to support &lt;strong&gt;such a massive change&lt;/strong&gt;, but O’Neill endorsed similar remarks made by President Trump. It’s not clear if the message, made in a Monday post on X, should be seen by drugmakers as an official directive from the agency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;O’Neill &lt;strong&gt;gave no reason why&lt;/strong&gt; he thinks separating the shots and spreading them out over time would be beneficial, but his comments build on the administration’s public skepticism of vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The combination MMR vaccine was licensed in &lt;strong&gt;1971&lt;/strong&gt;, and monovalent shots were &lt;strong&gt;phased out in 2009&lt;/strong&gt; due to the success of the combination shot.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Scientists say it &lt;strong&gt;wouldn’t make any sense&lt;/strong&gt; to change that, as there’s no safety issue. Separating the shots would likely decrease adherence to the entire schedule, experts say, and therefore increase disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“I think that that would not be met with any enthusiasm by, or acceptance by, either providers or parents who would see their children inoculated with substantially more doses of vaccine,” said William Schaffner, an epidemiologist and professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;It would also be a &lt;strong&gt;massive hurdle&lt;/strong&gt; for the two companies, Merck and GSK, that make combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccines for the U.S. market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“These monovalent vaccines are not even available and I do not envision that vaccine manufacturers are going to want to produce these monovalent vaccines – particularly if they need to be studied in placebo-controlled trials as the Department of HHS has called for,” said William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The idea to separate the shots originates from a paper published in 1998 by &lt;strong&gt;discredited British researcher Andrew Wakefield&lt;/strong&gt;, who claimed that the MMR vaccine was linked to increasing rates of autism.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His paper was subsequently retracted, and he is no longer able to practice medicine in the U.K.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNX0I5U0ZNT3paRGFlVFNydmFHZXR1RVJ0M2pva2ozN1ZmdzVQc0VCZWtEejA4LVRIQUFNbmdZRGV5bUdleldsS2xwQnM5V0xUOFdDNVEyRmIwM211ZVAzZXVfRVJXTmlNSXpnSjRuSkh3cjNfVXFnODFMUEVQc1AxTVVna1pNak9UM2tObEYwY2tKM2NQMXJwOFBXamRVUGfSAaQBQVVfeXFMUEVONWx1R1V1dzBXMEE0OGhVNGh2NkVmdVFCWC1MMEpXWVhmRzVVVzBhWFBvSEZ1N05XSjAyRmxQYmQxMHVqSk1oS1Y3RnFFR2JGUmdRLVVBSGw1ZjI4ZWdhOTROWDFKZEZCLUNNSHJqeF9qUTdQMXFtRjFHYTZIWkVVOF82XzlNOGhyY2l1cHFJWVhhY2U4bHh1U0FaaTY4TEFCTUE</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，常见的阿片类药物对缓解慢性疼痛并不那么有效- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/07/health/tramadol-opioid-chronic-pain-study-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxsmft001r3b6nowj2h8ap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tramadol, a potent synthetic opioid, has been widely used to treat moderate to severe pain, but a new study suggests that the medication’s potential risks outweigh its “limited” benefits for chronic pain and that the use of it should be minimized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000a3b6ne2w5jnc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, found that tramadol may have a “slight effect” on reducing chronic pain, but there appears to be low evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000b3b6nt8rfxrdu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The findings indicate that the benefits of tramadol are questionable or, at the very least, uncertain. Furthermore, evidence suggests the presence of potentially harmful effects,” Dr. Janus Jakobsen, lead author of the study and a clinical professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000c3b6nli96vkxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tramadol can have serious side effects, including cardiac events such as chest pain, heart disease or congestive heart failure, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000d3b6nj2edj7gg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Therefore, alternative treatment options should be considered before prescribing tramadol,” Jakobsen said. “Patients are advised to consult their physicians to determine the most appropriate treatment for their condition. Such treatments should likely be individualized according to the type of chronic pain experienced.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000e3b6na43ng9m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, opioids as a class of drugs can be addictive. It’s estimated that about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose" target="_blank"&gt;60 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; experience the addictive effects of opioids, and tramadol is often considered safer than other opioids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggyqn2700003b6qheeai0si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to manufacturer records, the new study says, nearly 12 million daily doses of tramadol were consumed worldwide from 1990 to 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000g3b6n4dg2aiuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, conducted by a research team in Denmark, included an analysis of 19 separate clinical trials that evaluated tramadol versus a placebo in treating various types of chronic pain. The trials were published between 1998 and 2024, and collectively they involved more than 6,500 people ages 47 to 69. Some of the trials included in the study were related to osteoarthritis, diabetic nerve pain and chronic low back pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000h3b6nv52ipzpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review related to the usage of tramadol for any type of chronic pain with a thorough investigation of adverse events,” the researchers wrote in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000i3b6njre1vvtw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their analysis found that tramadol increased the risk of both non-serious and serious adverse events, including nausea, dizziness, constipation, drowsiness, cardiac problems and “neoplasm” events, which are an abnormal and excessive growth of cells and tissue that can form tumors. These neoplasm growths can be either benign or cancerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000l3b6npqni0uft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also found that there was “low-certainty evidence” that tramadol may reduce the intensity of chronic pain below a certain level that they called the “minimal important difference” threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000m3b6nmyhh35wv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, pain intensity is measured using a visual or numerical scale, such as when patients are asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being unbearable pain, Jakobsen said. But since each person may have a difference in pain perception, the researchers used a minimal threshold to evaluate a clinical difference in tramadol’s ability to reduce pain versus a placebo, based on the clinical trials they evaluated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000n3b6n4wf4yubd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although statistical analyses may reveal differences in pain scores between patients, these differences may be so small that they are not perceptible to the patients themselves,” Jakobsen said. “Therefore, it is crucial to predefine a minimal clinically important difference when assessing pain levels to ensure that the results reflect changes that are meaningful to patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000o3b6nrpawxl13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new study, the researchers chose a “minimal important difference” that was equivalent to one point on the 10-point numerical rating scale. It appeared that the beneficial effect of tramadol on chronic pain was below that “minimal important difference” of one point, on average.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh00smb00063b6qk4ma6gov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents manufacturers of generic drugs, didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The takeaway finding that tramadol in randomized placebo-controlled trials did not meet their designated threshold of reducing pain scores by one – I am not too surprised by that,” said Dr. Michael Hooten, an anesthesiologist and pain specialist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000q3b6n56dkgo4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Opioids for longer-term, persistent chronic pain are not the best medications because of tolerance and other factors that may interfere with the long-term trajectory of opioid therapy,” Hooten said. “As a clinically working pain specialist, this review basically confirms many of the clinical factors that I already intuitively know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000s3b6ns15b89gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And although the study found that tramadol may have a “slight effect” on reducing chronic pain levels, that comes with the increased risk of concerning cardiac events and other potential side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000t3b6nptr1pipu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From my perspective, I don’t use a lot of tramadol, because I know there’s going to be a lot of adverse effects. I know the pain-reducing effects are going to be minimal. So that’s not necessarily a drug that I go to,” Hooten said. “That represents my personal, anecdotal clinical practice – if you talk to another pain expert or pain specialist, they’re going to have maybe a completely different opinion. It’s really complex.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000u3b6nl3efu7ob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study could be overestimating tramadol’s benefits, Jakobsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000v3b6npwptyuyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All included trials, except for two, were assessed as having a high risk of bias. This increases the likelihood that our findings may overestimate the beneficial effects and underestimate the harmful effects of tramadol, potentially presenting an overly favorable view of its efficacy,” Jakobsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000w3b6nxbg1jicl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tramadol remains widely prescribed for the management of chronic pain and is often regarded as safer than other opioids, but without evidence to support this,” he said. “The use of tramadol and other opioids should be minimized as much as possible. Our study provides evidence in support of this recommendation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000y3b6nczj1nix8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One limitation of the new study is that the amount of time patients were followed varied across the trials, which it makes unclear what the drug’s long-term risks versus benefits may be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000z3b6nidqctuu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the included trials were short-term – majority 12 weeks or less – so we can’t draw firm conclusions about long-term safety or sustained benefit,” Dr. Jason Chang, assistant professor and interventional spine and musculoskeletal medicine expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00103b6nkm6abuf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The review also grouped together a wide range of pain conditions, which may obscure differences in how tramadol works for specific diagnoses,” said Chang, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “Finally, the study only compared tramadol to placebo – not to other active treatments – so we don’t know how it stacks up against alternatives like NSAIDs or neuropathic medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00113b6nsgfycthd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Some physicians may prescribe tramadol to people who may not be able to take NSAIDs, for instance due to an underlying health condition or other medications they are taking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00123b6nb730siqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tramadol is not a magic bullet – on average, it provides only modest pain relief, and it carries real risks, including nausea, dizziness, constipation, and, in rare cases, more serious complications like cardiac events or seizures,” Chang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00133b6nwjwxn98r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It can be useful for select patients who can’t take NSAIDs or need short-term help to restore function, but it should be prescribed with clear functional goals, for limited durations, and with close monitoring for side effects,” he said. “The conversation shouldn’t be about banning tramadol, but about using it smarter – short courses, careful patient selection, and always as part of a plan that prioritizes mobility, function, and quality of life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00153b6njjki8ndy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research findings were no surprise to Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Your-Doctor-Kill/dp/B0FPMDZCF6/ref=sr_1_1?c" target="_blank"&gt;Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00163b6nmabxbeff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study confirms what I’ve observed in clinical practice for years - tramadol has been marketed as this ‘safer opioid’ alternative, but the reality is far more complicated,” Schwartz, who was not involved in the research, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00183b6nrudoutuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone is prescribed tramadol, Schwartz said, they should ask their provider these questions: Why are they getting this drug? What alternatives exist? Has anyone actually investigated what’s causing their chronic pain in the first place?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh0ns8i00003b6n5ruqhp0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that 1 in 5 adults live with chronic pain in the United States, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Hurt-Smart-Pain-Free/dp/1668014475" target="_blank"&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh0q7b600043b6nuhg8ztow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “About a third of them are restricted in what they can do and how to live. But there are alternatives to medication. We can reduce and even possibly eliminate pain by using our own body’s and mind’s capacity to manage it,” Gupta said. “Options can include meditation and yoga, massage and acupuncture. Even emphasizing eating anti-inflammatory foods like whole grains and leafy greens can help mitigate how our bodies react.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggztxt7000e3b6nsch6ix13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonopioid &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/hcp/clinical-care/nonopioid-therapies-for-pain-management.html" target="_blank"&gt;therapies for pain management&lt;/a&gt; may also include ice or heat, elevation, rest and quality sleep, or physical therapy and exercise. Medications may include NSAIDs, acetaminophen or other non-opioid drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00193b6ncgpioe8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I do not prescribe tramadol for chronic pain. Period. The risks are clear from this study,” Schwartz said. “The real tragedy is that millions of patients have been prescribed tramadol when what they needed was someone to investigate the actual cause of their pain. We’ve traded real solutions for prescription pads, and patients are suffering for it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

In younger and middle-aged adults, the most common short workout was stair climbing, either at home or on a gym machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among older adults, gentle leg exercises and tai chi—the Chinese martial art that combines flowing movements with controlled breathing—were most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers said: 'Their easy integration into daily routines addresses common barriers, such as lack of time and low motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition to research efforts, public health policies should aim to integrate exercise snacks into daily life by encouraging movement breaks throughout the day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercising for as little as five minutes, twice a day, can boost your cardiovascular fitness, new research has suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These quick and easy exercises were found to improve cardiovascular fitness (CRF) by between 4.6 and 17 per cent across the studies reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers saw no significant improvements in muscular endurance, strength or cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 70 per cent of participants were women, and those who showed the biggest gains in CRF were aged between 19 and 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors noted several limitations, including small sample sizes, and said more research was needed to confirm the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned that the findings may not be fully representative, as the studies did not include equal numbers of male and female participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, conducted in Australia, Canada, China and the UK, involved exercise programmes lasting between four and 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a worrying rise in heart-related deaths in the UK, which have soared by 18 per cent—from 18,693 to 21,975—between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, there has also been a 21 per cent increase in people being diagnosed with heart failure since 2020—the highest on record.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of people with atrial fibrillation—an irregular heartbeat—has also reached a record high, rising from 1.48 million to 1.62 million over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Heart Foundation analysis revealed an 83 per cent surge in the number of patients waiting for planned heart treatment in England, from the start of the decade to March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Waiting lists have also grown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity warned that the shift marks a reversal of decades of progress, during which annual deaths from heart attacks and strokes had halved since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest the rise may be fuelled by unhealthy diets and increased consumption of processed foods, the effects of Covid on the heart and circulatory system, and ongoing disruption to GP and hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just last year, a separate study found that simple, everyday movements such as carrying shopping bags or climbing stairs in short bursts could halve the risk of heart attack in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said turning these 'incidental exercises' into a regular habit could be a 'promising option' for women who dislike or struggle with structured workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Middle-aged women who averaged just 3.4 minutes of such activity a day were 45 per cent less likely to suffer a major cardiovascular event.

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, scientists stumbled upon a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness, the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z"&gt;most common cause of hair loss&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583821/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on a naturally occurring sugar that helps form DNA: the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt;' part of deoxyribonucleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying how these sugars aid &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222111437"&gt;wound healing in mice&lt;/a&gt; when applied topically, scientists at the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University in Pakistan noticed that the fur around treated lesions grew back faster than in untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, the team decided to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in June 2024, they took male mice with testosterone-driven hair loss and removed the fur from their backs. Each day, researchers smeared a small dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt; sugar gel on the exposed skin, and within weeks, the fur in this region showed 'robust' regrowth, sprouting long, thick individual hairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deoxyribose gel was so effective, the team found it worked just as well as minoxidil, a topical treatment for hair loss commonly known by the brand name Rogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth," &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/cure-male-pattern-baldness-given-boost-sugar-discovery"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; tissue engineer Sheila MacNeil from the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenic alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, is a natural condition caused by genetics, hormone levels, and aging, and it presents differently in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg" alt="male pattern baldness" class="wp-image-155531 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness presents differently in men and women.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers undertook a review of several PET-CT scans of patients who were taking the drugs, after uncovering the anomaly with one patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A PET-CT scan combines a CT scan and a PET scan. It uses a mildly radioactive liquid, known medically as a radioactive tracer, to show areas of your body where cells are more active than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A higher level of metabolic activity — and concentration of tracer on the scan — could signal potentially cancerous activity which appears as brighter spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 'several' patterns of tracer on the scans among GLP-1 users that were 'atypical' and 'could be misinterpreted' as hot spots, or potentially cancerous areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hot spot areas, with high levels of tracer, do not always signal cancer and could be a sign of other conditions such as infections or inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Strouhal said: 'Recognising the characteristic uptake associated with GLP-1 agonists helps avoid unnecessary anxiety and interventions, ensuring patients receive the right care, at the right time, without detours or doubt.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, further research involving more data is vital to prove this is the case, researchers said, before recommendations are made to alter PET-CT scan guidelines for all weight loss jab users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, medical teams should carefully consider a patient's medical history when interpreting scan results, they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research will be presented in full on October 8 at the Annual &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/us-congress/index.html" id="mol-f5ee4ff0-a381-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d" class=""&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14182453/Warning-experts-discover-weight-loss-jabs-like-Ozempic-render-breast-cancer-chemo-ineffective.html"&gt;research late last year found&lt;/a&gt; GLP-1 drugs could potentially interfere with breast &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a73cfeb0-a37c-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US study, hundreds of women with early-stage triple negative breast cancer were followed throughout and after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few dozen (25) were already taking GLP-1s alongside other &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f5f97280-a38c-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drugs and continued to do so while having cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests two years later showed just 28 per cent of the women on GLP-1s responded fully to the cancer therapies, and were clear of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than twice as many — 63 per cent — of those not on GLP-1s were cancer free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also discovered&lt;span&gt; GLP-1s had infiltrated tumour cells and &lt;/span&gt;immune cells in samples taken from the patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bethania Santos, an oncologist and researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who presented the study at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, said: 'Use of GLP-1 use may need to be carefully considered during breast cancer therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts at the time suggested the weight loss drugs themselves may not have decreased the effectiveness of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather, people who have advanced diabetes requiring multiple medications are at increased risk for breast cancer recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, they said, did not prove whether weight loss drugs help or hurt the effectiveness of cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A Raleigh man is accused
of spraying blood in the eyes of health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Kameron Gilchrist, 25,
faces two charges for assaulting emergency personnel. He's accused of
exposing two employees to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the two
employees contracted HIV through the incident on March 21, 2025. Authorities
arrested Gilchrist on Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health Rex wouldn’t comment
on specific patient or employee incidents. The hospital said violence against
medical personnel is becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the arrest
warrant, Gilchrist was receiving a diabetic treatment when he allegedly sprayed
blood in the eyes of two hospital employees. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s
unclear whether the blood sprayed was Gilchrist’s
or not.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;However, the arrest warrant
says the two hospital employees were caused physical injuries including
irritation and exposure to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;UNC REX
told WRAL News that protecting the health and safety of its employees is a top
priority. The hospital said it would work closely with its own security teams
and law enforcement to keep everyone safe and pursue charges when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News asked Raleigh police
why it took six months to arrest and charge Gilchrist.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Raleigh police said Gilchrist
was receiving medical and psychiatric treatment at the time of the incident so
he could not be arrested then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Authorities are holding
Gilchrist on $25,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Ars Technica in August, Brigid Groves, vice president of professional affairs for the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) signaled that efforts to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines is concerning to APhA, which is the leading organization representing pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about that because the data and evidence point to the fact that this vaccine is safe and effective for [young, otherwise healthy] patients," Groves said. "So, to suddenly arbitrarily limit that is very concerning to us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, with the CDC's permissive recommendations, pharmacies are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; limiting them. Representatives for both CVS and Walgreens &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/06/cdc-covid-vaccine-rules-eligibility-availability/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU5NzIzMjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMTA1NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk3MjMyMDAsImp0aSI6ImZlZjBlODg3LTU5ZjMtNDk3YS1iNjczLWVkYzllYzRlMDg0MiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyNS8xMC8wNi9jZGMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1ydWxlcy1lbGlnaWJpbGl0eS1hdmFpbGFiaWxpdHkvIn0.1KVy4WMWh2DE7lNseEMo-5J4KtGZtRkqt9P_6HtMQUs"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that they would not require patients under 65 to prove they have an underlying condition to get a COVID-19 vaccine. CVS won't ask you to self-attest to having a condition, and Walgreens also said that it won't require any proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In simplest terms, if a patient wants to get the vaccine, they’ll get it," Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the shared decision-making, there may be extra forms about risks and benefits that might take an extra few minutes, but it should otherwise be just like past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, this reporter was able to easily book same-day appointments for an updated COVID-19 vaccine at local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies in North Carolina, without attesting to any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shots for younger children could be trickier&lt;/strong&gt;: While adults and older children can visit their pharmacy and get vaccinated relatively easily, younger children (particularly those under age 5) may have a harder time. Pharmacists typically do not vaccinate those younger children—which has always been the case—and parents will have to visit the pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians, like pharmacists, are likely to be supportive of broad access to the shots. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;all children should have access&lt;/a&gt;. The AAP also specifically encourages children under age 2 and children with underlying conditions to get vaccinated, because those children are at higher risk of severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the United States alone, over 50 million people deal with the complications of osteoporosis. While it's more common in people over 50, you can show symptoms earlier, especially since the human body reaches peak bone mass by age 30. The disease causes bones to weaken or become brittle, leading to serious injuries even from minor complications. Putting any amount of strain on the bones and body structure, like coughing, falling, or bending over, can cause a severe bone break in those with the disease. We know a lot about it — it's caused by the growth of new bone not keeping up with the loss of old bone, and can be characterized as a deficiency — though getting enough calcium and vitamin D when younger can help prevent it. Treatment is a little more tricky, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02291-y" target="_blank"&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/a&gt; could prove it's possible to reverse the disease and create a real treatment. Spearheaded by researchers from University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the scientists identified a natural bone-strengthening mechanism in the human body that can be targeted for said treatment. The gene, GPR133 or ADGRD1, influences bone density in the body and adjusts the bone-building process through cells called osteoblasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, currently available osteoporosis treatments slow the condition but do not halt or reverse the process. Moreover, they come with a lot of baggage — risky side effects like an increased risk of infection or disease. As the body builds a tolerance, they also become less effective over time. In fact, some risky NSAIDs &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/lifestyle/walmart-issues-supplement-recall-due-to-hidden-drugs-check-your-pantry-now/" target="_blank"&gt;have been recalled by retailers like Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, at the moment, preventing osteoporosis is the best we can do; doing so is even &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1971165/what-us-military-body-fat-rule-high-fitness-scores-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;a reason the U.S. military's body fat rule has changed&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on fitness over a low body fat percentage can help prevent future issues, weakened bones being one.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Crevis2/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is not the first time the GPR133 gene has been linked to bone density and development, and in the 2025 study, the researchers began by focusing on the proteins that gene encoded. They used a chemical called AP503 — which was "only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133," according to biochemist and &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03" target="_blank"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; researcher Ines Liebscher — to test the bone strengthening and weakening process in mice. In short, they used that chemical to activate the gene, or leave it dormant when absent, which directly influenced how the mice grew. When the chemical activated the gene, they grew up with strong, healthy bones. When the chemical was absent, the mice had weak bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The experiments show that the chemical AP503 can act as a sort of button to enable or disable growth, encouraging the osteoblasts in the bone to work harder. Interestingly, the research team was also able to show that when working together with regular exercise in the subject, the two methods can strengthen bones even further. If developed into future treatments, scientists believe they could be used to strengthen bones that are already healthy, and rebuild weakened bones. Most importantly, they should be effective at any age — even women going through menopause changes. In fact, weakening bones and the general deterioration of bones and cartilage is &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-why-you-shrink-as-you-get-older/" target="_blank"&gt;a big reason why you shrink as you get older&lt;/a&gt;, so it's important that any treatments would be usable later in life. Overall, this some pretty big news. But, of course, potential treatments are not even close to human clinical trials, so it could be a long while yet before those treatments make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;

In healthy individuals, this gene is typically active only in alpha cells, which produce glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to raise blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the SMOC1 gene is active in beta cells. This is a critical problem because beta cells produce insulin, another hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with T2D, beta cells are reprogrammed into dysfunctional alpha-like cells, and the SMOC1 gene is the primary driver of this damaging transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, introducing the SMOC1 protein to healthy beta cells impaired their ability to produce and release insulin. The inability to make or use insulin effectively is the defining characteristic of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discovering SMOC1 as the key culprit driving the harmful transformation could lead to the development of a drug to block SMOC1's action and halt &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15078069/treatment-reverse-type-2-diabetes-banish-insulin-jabs.html"&gt;the progression of T2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Geming Lur, co-corresponding author and researcher at City of Hope, one of the country’s most advanced cancer treatment organizations, said: ‘Normally, SMOC1 is active in healthy people’s alpha cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But we saw it start showing up in the diabetic beta cells, too. It should not have been there.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study identifies SMOC1 as the key driver of beta cell failure, making it a promising drug target. Blocking it could protect insulin-producing cells and halt T2D progression (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using advanced single-cell RNA sequencing, City of Hope scientists analyzed pancreatic tissue from 26 donors: 13 with T2D, which affects more than 37 million Americans, and 13 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This approach allowed the researchers not only to identify cell types but also to categorize the cells into precise groups and map the dysfunctional pathways that cause insulin-producing cells to transform and fail in people with T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After gathering a massive genetic dataset, the team used sophisticated computational analyses to identify the five alpha cell subtypes, including AB cells, immature cells that can develop into either alpha or beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm that the gene SMOC1 was a key driver of beta cell dysfunction, the researchers increased SMOC1 levels in human beta cells in the lab and observed a direct, detrimental effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insulin production dropped and the cells began to lose their identity, transforming into a different, dysfunctional cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests revealed that SMOC1 crippled beta cell function by simultaneously halting insulin secretion and disrupting the cell's ability to produce new, functional insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is critical because insulin is the hormone that signals to the body's cells to allow sugar from the blood to enter and be used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without enough properly functioning insulin, sugar builds up in the bloodstream, which is the root cause of the high blood sugar levels that define diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' final round of validation showed that SMOC1 protein levels were significantly higher in diabetic patients and, critically, that this protein was present within the insulin-producing beta cells themselves, confirming its role in the human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Randy Kang, senior research associate at City of Hope and a co-author, said: ‘The SMOC1 gene has barely been studied in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Based on these properties, we suspect SMOC1 strongly influences the differentiation and function of beta cells.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This discovery opens a new front in diabetes treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic, manage blood sugar, a therapy that directly targets and inhibits SMOC1 could be the first to address the root cause of beta cell failure by protecting their identity and function, potentially halting or reversing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, there are no approved gene therapies targeting the SMOC1 gene for T2D. The discovery of SMOC1's role is very recent, placing it at the earliest stages of therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62670-5#Sec2"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists has identified five different sleep profiles that link the quality of a person's shut-eye with a variety of health, psychological, and lifestyle outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's something we all do frequently, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;science of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is still pretty murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the scientists examined multiple aspects of sleep quality and how they related to a variety of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-6-sleep-traits-to-risk-of-172-diseases"&gt;Massive Study Links 6 Sleep Traits to Risk of 172 Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed information on 770 healthy young adults collected through the Human Connectome Project, which includes brain imaging data as well as patient-reported sleep, health, and lifestyle characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this together, the team identified five distinct sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that show unique patterns of brain network organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first profile links poor sleep with negative mental health outcomes. Patients fitting this profile showed a range of sleep problems, particularly taking longer to fall asleep at night and being less satisfied with their sleep overall. They expressed higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, stress, fear, and anger problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png" alt="Study Says There Are 5 Types of Sleeper – Here's What Your Profile Says About Your Health" class="wp-image-176639 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-600x250.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1.png 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The first sleep profile in the study shows clear links between a range of sleep issues and mental health outcomes.

For patients in this group, their issues likely stem from other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third profile was defined largely by the use of sleep aid medications. People in this group demonstrated greater conscientiousness and reported feeling more satisfied in their friendships and emotional support networks. However, they also showed increased cognitive problems with visual episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and spatial orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profile number four was mostly linked to sleep duration, with fewer hours of rest associated with more aggressive behavior and difficulty with emotional processing, language, and fluid intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the fifth profile was driven largely by sleep disturbances, waking frequently during the night. These patients also exhibited aggressive behavior and similar cognitive issues as profile four, but were also more likely to have thought problems, anxiety, high blood pressure, be smokers, and show symptoms of alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The different sleep profiles were also supported by unique patterns of brain function measured with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that sleep experiences are reflected not just in health and behavior, but also in the brain's wiring and activity," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/what-type-of-sleeper-are-you-and-how-is-it-impacting-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Aurore Perrault, neuroscientist at Concordia University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep has been extensively studied, most studies examine single factors in isolation, correlating with single outcomes. The team hopes that by looking at a wider range of associations and understanding which of the five profiles best describes each patient, doctors may better diagnose and treat sleep disorders and related health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, research is constantly revealing new ways that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;sleep is linked with our wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-begins-to-suffer-after-just-3-nights-of-bad-sleep"&gt;Too little is unhealthy&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of ways – but so is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-study-found-too-much-sleep-increases-risk-of-death-heres-why"&gt;too much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;hours aren't a good measure&lt;/a&gt; alone: some people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-some-people-need-less-sleep-the-answer-lies-in-our-genes"&gt;naturally need more or less&lt;/a&gt; than others.

Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4fb96" class="body-graf"&gt;How we process devastation, grief, loss and sadness isn’t one size fits all. Neither is how we offer comfort. However, of the many modes of support, there’s one that experts say is a big no-no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc7ed9" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of consoling someone, this common phrase tends to “minimize what that person is experiencing,” licensed clinical psychologist Ayanna Abrams, Ph.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.ascensionbehavioralhealth.com/"&gt;Ascension Behavioral Health,&lt;/a&gt; tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11d6de" class="body-graf"&gt;By saying it, you “are dismissing the validity or maybe even the intensity of what is happening,” she adds. This response lacks empathy and fails to make an emotional connection between you and the person you care about during their time of need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-58d8db" class="body-graf"&gt;Though you likely mean no harm, telling someone to "just get over it" is doing the opposite of what you intended, which is why Abrams avoids it at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-518b6d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Told Somebody to ‘Just Get Over It’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8ed34" class="body-graf"&gt;You might tell someone to “just get over it” because you don’t know what else to say, Abrams says. Sometimes, when we don’t know how to show up for someone, we encourage them to make the problem go away. That move, however, is more beneficial to you than it is to the person seeking help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055061" class="body-graf"&gt;Other times, frustration is the driving force, Abrams says. You might tell someone to “just get over it” because you’re tired of hearing about a particular problem again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b98ddc" class="body-graf"&gt;In her practice, Abrams has also found that some people think this is a helpful thing to say. “Like it’s something the person hasn’t thought of,” she says. But trust that the person has likely tried to get over it and can’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c689c4" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0e4ee" class="body-graf"&gt;By telling someone (or yourself) to “just get over it,” says Abrams, you’re encouraging someone to disconnect from their emotions — which any mental health expert will tell you is never a good thing. Suppressing a feeling almost guarantees it will “demand to be felt,” Abrams says. The more we try to push them aside and compartmentalize, the more they’ll keep making their way to the forefront of our minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84c4e6" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37648224/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141473/#S47" target="_blank"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that pushing feelings away causes &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-deal-stress-daily-basis-t126882"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologist-tip-to-reduce-stress-in-10-minutes-rcna224766?search=stress" target="_blank"&gt;coronary artery disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and adverse social outcomes. It can also lead to anxiety and depression, Abrams adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0fcdf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Encouraging someone to get over something can also cause feelings of judgement and shame because they’ll feel like they’re not processing something quickly enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-521d70" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-721ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;If someone tells you to “just get over it,” says Abrams, turn to these coping mechanisms instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-62fc7a" class="body-heading"&gt;Sit with your emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3c5dd" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is a practice of mindfulness,” says Abrams. “It means allowing whatever comes up to come up, whether that’s physiologically, whether that’s emotionally, whether that’s physically. It’s not fighting the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4016c1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Oftentimes, unpleasant emotions stay around longer because we try to control them,” Abrams points out. “If you are able to engage in a tolerant act of letting emotions move through you,” they’ll eventually make their way through your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8935b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Once we allow ourselves to sit with our emotions, “we learn how to cope with them differently, and it mitigates how they sit in our bodies,” she adds. Eventually, that emotion will take less and less of a toll on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48af9d" class="body-graf"&gt;If you find yourself itching to tell someone to get over something, do this instead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-e78453" class="body-heading"&gt;Practice empathy.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d561ca" class="body-graf"&gt;“Meet the person where they are,” says Abrams. She suggests phrases including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-554f6a" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;“That sounds like it’s really still bothering you.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“That sounds like it’s still really hard for you.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“That sounds really difficult.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“I can hear the frustration right in your voice.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-88b631" class="body-graf"&gt;You might also ask the person what they need: “How can I help?” “Do you want advice?” “Do you just need someone to listen?” “Do you want me to distract you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4bf7f" class="body-graf"&gt;By doing this, says Abrams, you’re reminding this person that their feelings are worthwhile and they can rely on you to take them seriously, and they're not alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-440e7a" class="body-heading"&gt;Offer physical comfort when appropriate.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ab341" class="body-graf"&gt;If you find yourself struggling with words, ask for consent to touch and ask, “Do you want a hug?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-900790" class="body-graf"&gt;Otherwise, you can ask, “Want to go for a walk?” &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.70035"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; movement is a great way to work through heavy emotions, says Abrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b1ac76" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, if you’ve already told someone to just get over it, you can still course correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-13346d" class="body-heading"&gt;Apologize.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea46b5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Lead with honesty, says Abrams, and say you're sorry. Tell the person you didn’t realize that encouraging them to get over it would have the opposite effect. Explain that minimizing their feelings wasn’t your intent and ask how you can better support them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 17:58:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOdVQzYWFlSEllRXROd3NHTUsyWDVwTXV6SlFRT09IbVdGVXJ4ZjJxaHVNdFNBZlVnanBORW9ObkV3Z2dTa29IZDBSRFJzRDJjS0ZYYVQxa3F4M3hCSVBMa2ZZZVBaWGtNMUFxUFZiUDlPMW45RUR1RjlFNW5aN2dQWXFaR2RQYWo3YjFuXzJ0SWpJNG9kOG1ycWpCdETSAVRBVV95cUxQNWFlRXFyaVJLVGJ5QnpNTmVKM3A4bU9mcy00OERtRDlGck9zR1lvdGZPX19RX3FoTGpmb1hQc1ExY3JIYm8xMjNKdXdMenRHajU3WmQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员对现已到达城市的致命昆虫传播热带病毒发出警告- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/first-cases-of-tropical-virus-oropouche-spread-by-mosquito-are-recorded-in-uk/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have confirmed the first travel-linked cases of Oropouche virus in the United Kingdom this year. The warning asks anyone who returns from affected regions and develops a sudden fever, headache, or intense body aches to contact a clinician quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes called sloth fever because the virus circulates in sloths in parts of Latin America. Most people recover within a week, though a small number can develop brain or nerve complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah A. J. Guagliardo, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), has led recent work clarifying how quickly symptoms start and what that means for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Symptoms of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus belongs to the Orthobunyavirus group and is an arbovirus, meaning a virus that is spread to people by biting insects. It was first identified in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness usually causes an abrupt fever, pounding headache, and joint and muscle pain. Some patients also report nausea, light sensitivity, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors sometimes hear about symptom relapse a few days after apparent recovery. That second wave is uncomfortable, but most people still recover fully with rest and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-about-the-u-k-cases"&gt;What we know about the U.K. cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-week-34-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt; in Europe recorded three travel-linked Oropouche cases in U.K. residents. All three people had visited Brazil in early 2025. The cases were all were imported, with no sign of local spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern matches what other European countries saw in 2024 and 2025. Imported infections arrive with travelers, then stop because the key insect that spreads this virus is not established in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mosquitoes-may-spread-oropouche"&gt;Mosquitoes may spread Oropouche&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus spreads mainly through the bites of infected biting midges, tiny insects that thrive in warm, humid areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mosquito species can also transmit it. People who spend time outdoors without repellent or window screens are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are studying vertical transmission, which is when a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-dormant-virus-punuivirus-discovered-in-algae-could-revolutionize-gene-editing/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; passes from a pregnant person to the fetus. That question matters for travel counseling even if the overall risk remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual spread has not been documented, but health agencies note that the virus has been detected in semen and vaginal secretions. That finding warrants caution for recent travelers who develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incubation-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Incubation of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fever can rise quickly, often with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and aching joints. Clinicians also watch for rashes, dizziness, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In conclusion, our results indicate that 50% of travelers infected with OROV will develop symptoms within 3 to 4 days of exposure,” wrote Dr. Guagliardo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0468_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of travel-associated cases estimated the incubation period using patient exposure timelines and symptom onset data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relapse of symptoms can occur in a significant share of patients. That possibility helps explain why some people feel better, then feel unwell again several days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pregnancy-and-severe-outcomes"&gt;Pregnancy and severe outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the first Oropouche-related deaths on July 25, 2024, and investigators also examined possible mother to child infections during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those events were rare, but health authorities continue to analyze what factors increase risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doctors also see neck stiffness, confusion, or persistent severe headache, they consider meningitis or encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are uncommon complications of Oropouche but need urgent care because they involve inflammation around the brain or in the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-that-actually-works"&gt;Prevention that actually works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;U,K. health &lt;a href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/08/13/what-are-the-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus-disease-and-how-can-you-avoid-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/"&gt;repellents&lt;/a&gt; with at least 50 percent DEET for travelers to affected areas, along with long sleeves and trousers during peak biting hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other precautions include staying in rooms with air conditioning or secure window screens, sleeping under fine mesh nets, removing standing water near lodging, and carefully following insecticide instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who recently returned to the U.K. from the Americas and develop sudden fever should call a clinician and mention their travel history. Early testing helps rule out other infections with similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-guidelines-for-travelers"&gt;Prevention guidelines for travelers &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health agencies emphasize that Oropouche virus joins a longer list of insect-borne infections that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hpv-common-virus-drives-skin-cancer-growth-by-hijacking-the-bodys-cells/"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies often package advice on Zika, dengue, chikungunya, malaria and Oropouche together, since all rely on insect bites for spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to encourage simple habits, like packing repellents before trips, just as routinely as carrying sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities also point out that individual precautions are only part of the picture. Surveillance, early diagnosis, and coordinated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-borne-diseases-are-a-growing-threat-in-a-warming-world/"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt; control in affected countries remain the backbone of prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these broader efforts, even well-prepared travelers may still face risks when outbreaks surge in tropical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-about-oropouche-virus"&gt;More questions about Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKHSA recently &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/689ca9d49a65499b446361ff/oropouche-virus-a-rapid-evidence-gap-map.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mapped&lt;/a&gt; 269 studies on Oropouche and found strong evidence on surveillance and viral genomics, yet very limited research on vaccines, treatments, and real-world public health measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no human clinical trials of medicines and few data on which community interventions curb spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those gaps matter for planning.

Participants were more likely to recall words they were told to remember than those carrying emotional weight, even though emotion sometimes strengthened recall or caused false memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, sleep itself did not enhance memory performance, though certain sleep brain waves, such as sleep spindles, were linked to better recall of emotional material. These findings suggest that conscious intention plays a stronger role than emotion or sleep in shaping what the brain stores and forgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intent Beats Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Directed memory (“remember this”) was more effective than emotional content for recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Brain Waves Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep spindles aided recall of emotional cues, but overall sleep had no major effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Memories:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative emotional words increased the likelihood of recalling events that never occurred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep has long been understood to help us consolidate new memories, but we don’t understand how. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with negative feelings like fear or stress can improve recall, but intentionally trying to remember can also be effective. But these two mechanisms are very different — one involuntary, one deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which influences memory most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, researchers asked participants to remember or forget words, some of which had negative emotional associations. They found that instructions improved recall more than emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we intend to remember and to forget can be powerful,” said Dr Laura Kurdziel of Merrimack College, lead author of the article in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. “We have more control over our memories than we often think we do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep on it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers performed two matching studies — one where 45 participants completed the task online, and one where 53 participants visited the lab. Half of each group received their words to remember in the morning and then tested their memories that evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other half received their words in the evening and were tested on the following morning, after sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the evening group of lab-based participants, the team supplied electroencephalogram (EEG) headbands that measured their brain activity while they slept. All participants took part in two sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first session, participants watched 100 words appear on a screen, each followed by a cue to remember or forget. Half of the selected words had negative emotional connotations, and the other half were neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterwards, participants were shown another set of 100 words and asked if they recognized them. 50 of these were from the previous task, but 50 were ‘foils’ which they hadn’t seen before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the second session, 12 hours later, the scientists asked participants to report as many of the words they’d been asked to remember as possible. The scientists then analyzed the participants’ performance and EEG data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a memory palace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that when it comes to memory, instructions do indeed work better than emotion. People were more likely to recall words they had been asked to remember. However, emotions did play a part: words participants had been asked to remember that had negative connotations were more likely to be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that although instructions were the primary influence on recall, emotional cues could amplify the effect of instructions. Emotions also increased the chances of false memories: negative foils were more likely to be misremembered as words participants had been asked to remember. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During encoding, we will devote more attentional resources to words that we are told explicitly to remember,” said Kurdziel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along similar lines, cognitive control systems can ‘tag’ information as relevant, biasing the hippocampus to prioritize it. This increases the likelihood that the memory will be reactivated during sleep and transferred to long-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lastly, instructions don’t just enhance relevant items, they also suppress irrelevant ones. By inhibiting competing memories, remember-cued items face less interference, which improves recall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, whether participants had slept had no effect on how well they recalled words. However, the different types of brain wave activity measured by the EEG were linked to recall. For example, higher levels of REM theta power, a measure of REM sleep, were associated with the misremembering of negative foils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep spindles were associated with better recall of negative, remember-cued words,” said Kurdziel, referring to a kind of brain wave that looks like a burst of spikes on the brain wave recordings. “Sleep spindles are widely implicated in the transfer of information from temporary hippocampal storage to more stable representations in the neocortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By contrast, slow wave sleep was negatively correlated with total recall,” Kurdziel continued.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was somewhat unexpected — slow wave sleep is often associated with improvements in declarative memory. However, it has also been theorized to facilitate active forgetting of irrelevant or redundant information.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could indicate that sleeping only consolidates some memories — prioritizing things you’re motivated to remember over things which are emotional — and that sleeping in general is less significant than your brain’s activity during sleep. However, more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of participants who provided usable EEG data was relatively small, which reduces confidence in the strength of sleep–memory associations,” explained Kurdziel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the sample consisted primarily of college students, making it difficult to generalize the findings to broader populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856954665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does emotion help or hurt memory recall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Emotional content can enhance recall slightly but also increases false memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856970272"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does sleep improve memory in this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: No general memory boost was found, though certain brain waves during sleep correlated with recall accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856983658"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What was the strongest factor influencing memory retention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Intentionally deciding what to remember had the greatest impact on long-term recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9c9cbdccacaf9dfcbd6d7cdd0dccbcad0d797d6cbde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2025.1643449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Top-Down Instruction Outweighs Emotional Salience: Nocturnal Sleep Physiology Indicates Selective Memory Consolidation&lt;/a&gt;” by Laura Kurdziel et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Instruction Outweighs Emotional Salience: Nocturnal Sleep Physiology Indicates Selective Memory Consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, not only stabilizing newly encoded information but also potentially supporting forgetting. Yet it remains unclear how sleep prioritizes what is retained or discarded when multiple salience cues, such as emotional valence and top-down instructional goals, compete for consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; In two studies, we examined how emotional content and intentional memory instruction interact to shape memory performance across a 12 h interval that included either nocturnal sleep or wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a directed forgetting paradigm with neutral and negatively valenced words, followed by immediate recognition and delayed free recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In both Study 1 (online) and Study 2 (in-lab), behavioral results showed that instruction to remember significantly enhanced recognition and recall, whereas emotion alone did not produce consistent benefits; however, sleep condition did not impact memory performance. In Study 2 (in-lab), which included overnight EEG monitoring, physiological markers of sleep revealed meaningful correlates of memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, sleep spindle activity predicted recall for negative remember-cued words, while Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) and delta power were negatively correlated with total recall, suggesting a trade-off between deep sleep and memory accessibility. REM theta power was associated with increased false recall of emotionally negative foils, consistent with emotional memory generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Importantly, these findings extend prior nap-based research by demonstrating that full-night sleep physiology reflects selective consolidation mechanisms even in the absence of overt behavioral effects. Overall, results underscore the primacy of top-down instruction over emotional salience in shaping memory, and highlight the utility of sleep physiology for understanding selective memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 17:13:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFA0TjJYcElfOVA4TEtDQUd3N1BfV0xVdk0yVW4xRWNhdElmTEZpT0pPYlRNc0tJOW9IYno4OVBQQ1BDTnU0Snp4WEVKVHZ5eDhCODhxTmE4bVFnWXg2VzhYZVVrQUd1SFRG</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏病专家的说法，如果您需要降低胆固醇，排名第一的下午习惯- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-afternoon-habit-for-lowering-cholesterol-11825586</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking care of your heart is one of the best things you can do for your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two common types of fiber: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods to get the benefits they provide. For lowering cholesterol in particular, you want more soluble fiber. “Fiber, particularly soluble fiber, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;binds cholesterol in the intestinal tract&lt;/a&gt; and prevents it from being absorbed,” notes cardiologist &lt;a href="https://www.steponefoods.com/pages/about-elizabeth-klodas-md" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas MD, FACC&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There have been many studies linking soluble fiber to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878706/foods-that-can-help-prevent-high-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. A recent meta-analysis found that for every additional 5 grams of a soluble fiber supplement people consumed helped lower LDL cholesterol by over 5 mg/dL. Getting more fiber also helped lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber Supports a Healthy Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol, in part because of inflammation and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fiber can make you feel full, which is helpful to limit portion size,” states cardiologist &lt;a href="https://cardiaccare.cooperandinspira.org/physicians/matthew-j-bocchese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Matthew J. Bocchese, MD&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber takes longer to digest, which is also why it aids in feeling more satisfied after a meal or snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber also interacts with your hunger hormones, like GLP-1, to send a signal to your brain that you’re full.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fiber is also the fuel for the specific bacteria in the microbiome that make GLP-1 (the same molecule as Ozempic or Wegovy). Which means that fiber helps curb appetite as well, reducing calorie intake leading to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss naturally&lt;/a&gt;,” adds Klodas.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While humans can’t technically digest fiber, the bacteria in our gut can “feed” off those fibers. And as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283531/top-fiber-rich-foods-for-good-gut-bacteria/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber gets fermented in our gut&lt;/a&gt;, it produces short chain fatty aids which help reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber is also found in fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains and nuts, which are all promoted in an anti-inflammatory style of eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beyond fiber, we also want to add foods that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;combat inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, since even with normal cholesterol levels, chronic inflammation can increase cardiovascular risk, particularly in women.  A nutrient-adequate diet that includes B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, zinc, and polyphenols has been shown to help lower markers of inflammation, such as hsCRP,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiology registered dietitian.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber helps slow digestion, leading to smaller blood sugar spikes after eating. A systematic review that looked at people with Type 2 diabetes found that fiber helped improve &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290762/why-are-fasting-glucose-levels-high/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fasting blood glucose&lt;/a&gt; and HbA1c levels, a measure of blood sugar over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Making sure you eat carbohydrates with fiber is key for blood sugar management. Balance out carbs with healthy fat and protein too, and limit added sugars in your diet.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body&lt;/strong&gt;: “Regular exercise—in addition to all of its other heart and mental health benefits—can help lower cholesterol by increasing your body’s metabolism of cholesterol and decreasing or preventing insulin resistance,” notes Bocchese.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Any movement helps, so try short walks or small exercise breaks throughout the day if you’re just getting started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough lycopene: &lt;/strong&gt;Lycopene is a carotenoid that may help lower inflammation, improve HDL cholesterol and lower total cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Routhenstein suggests getting more from cooked tomatoes and red bell peppers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt;: Routhenstein shares, “add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich fatty fish&lt;/a&gt; (like salmon, sardines, or mackerel) to improve HDL function, which helps recycle LDL cholesterol back to the liver.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit saturated fat, added sugar, and sodium: &lt;/strong&gt; What you eat more of for your cholesterol is just as important as what you eat less of. Sugar, saturated fat, and sodium have been associated with poor heart health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check the labels on package foods, stay mindful of how much sugar and salt you add to meals and snacks and choose fats like olive or avocado oil over butter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It would be nice if a fiber boost in the afternoon flipped a switch and lowered cholesterol instantly. But your health is a bit more complex than that. Still, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small habits&lt;/a&gt;—like choosing a fiber-filled snack in the afternoon—can spark other healthy shifts. And over time, those small changes add up to make a meaningful difference. “By committing to simple, repeatable dietary routines now, you can improve not only your cholesterol numbers but also overall cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure, blood sugar, and long-term heart function,” notes Klodas. &lt;br&gt;

But global efforts to find treatments for drug-resistant infections are not going to plan, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;according to two reports from the World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; released on 2 October&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reports show that the global antibiotic drug-development pipeline is facing a dual crisis: a scarcity of drugs in development and a lack of innovation in methods to fight drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antimicrobial resistance is escalating, but the pipeline of new treatments and diagnostics is insufficient to tackle the spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections,” said Yukiko Nakatani, who is the WHO assistant director-general for health systems in Geneva, Switzerland, in a statement. “Without more investment in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), together with dedicated efforts to ensure that new and existing products reach the people who most need them, drug-resistant infections will continue to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health research has highlighted the extent of the AMR crisis. A report published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; last year found that the annual number of deaths from drug-resistant infections could increase to nearly two million by 2050, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;up from one million a year between 1990 and 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of deaths attributable to AMR is predicted to rise to 1.91 million in 2050, with a further 8.22 million associated deaths (see ‘Resistance on the rise’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Awareness of this issue is increasing; however, it is still a silent pandemic with many deaths not being attributed to AMR,” says Rietie Venter, a microbiologist at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Resistance on the rise.

According to the analysis from the WHO, 90 antibacterial drugs are currently in development (see ‘Innovation crisis’). However, only 15 qualify as innovative — drugs that exert an additional clinically significant benefit — and only five are effective against at least one of the ‘critical bacteria’ listed on the WHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;bacterial priority pathogen list&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2023, the number of antibacterial drugs in clinical-development pipelines has decreased after a WHO ruling stated that some of them were non-innovative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preclinical pipeline remains active, with 232 programmes across 148 groups worldwide. However, 90% of companies involved are small firms, which highlights the fragility of the R&amp;amp;D ecosystem, the report says. Large pharmaceutical companies have been leaving the antibiotics market for years owing to a lack of financial investment and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;low approval ratings of new antibiotics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Innovation crisis.

AMR happens when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve ways to become resistant to drugs after being exposed to them, meaning drug makers have to play a constant cat-and-mouse game of creating new antibiotics to overcome evolving resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in human medicine and agriculture are the main drivers of AMR, which is why cuts to antibiotic usage are needed to reduce drug-resistant infections, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;alongside new antibiotic therapies&lt;/a&gt;. Gwen Knight and Kathryn Holt, who are co-directors of the AMR Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say that there are insufficient data to know the relative importance of livestock versus human antibiotic use in driving AMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World leaders have committed to cutting the global use of antibiotics to reduce AMR-related deaths by 10% by 2030. However, the pledge doesn’t look likely to succeed, because projections suggest that antibiotic use in both humans and livestock will increase in the years ahead (see ‘Animal antimicrobials’). “We cannot prevent the development of AMR, but we can implement measures to slow it down, and currently, we are not super successful with this,” says Venter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Animal antimicrobials.

Many of the deadliest infections are caused by a group of bacteria with particularly strong drug resistance, called gram-negative bacteria. This category includes &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; — a pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Only five of the antibacterials currently in the drug-development pipeline are effective against these priority bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes during menopause can drive suicidal thoughts – a crisis that healthcare services have failed to recognise or adequately address. The devastating link is laid bare in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17455057251338941"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, which involved interviews with 42 women who experienced suicidal thoughts and behaviour during perimenopause or menopause, exposes a troubling pattern. Women in crisis are being prescribed antidepressants instead of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), despite clear &lt;a href="https://themenopausecharity.org/information-and-support/what-can-help/treatment-options/hormone-replacement-therapy/antidepressants-and-menopause/"&gt;menopause guidelines&lt;/a&gt; stating that antidepressants should not be a first-choice treatment for menopause-related low mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, suicide rates have climbed among women in their &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/282203/suicide-rate-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-since-2000-by-gender/"&gt;mid-40s to mid-50s&lt;/a&gt; – precisely the age when most experience the menopausal transition. Yet the role of hormonal changes in this mental health crisis has been largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in the study described feelings of profound hopelessness and entrapment. One participant said: “What’s the point in being alive? What purpose, what function do I have? I’ve got nothing left to give, nothing left to contribute. Why am I still here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perimenopausal depression they described went beyond ordinary low mood, encompassing crushing fatigue, a sense of worthlessness and the feeling of being a burden to loved ones. Many questioned whether their lives had any remaining value or purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A healthcare blind spot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research revealed alarming gaps in medical knowledge and care. Women reported lengthy delays in receiving appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and frequent misdiagnoses. Many said their GPs lacked a basic understanding of how hormones affect mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was zero knowledge about hormones,” one woman said of her GP. “They were doing their best with what they felt they knew, but they didn’t know anything about this subject whatsoever. It’s not on their assessments to ask about women’s menstrual cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when women explicitly requested hormone treatment, some were refused due to a rigid interpretation of clinical guidelines. &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2730"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that antidepressants are being prescribed disproportionately to women – a pattern that, in some cases reported in the study, worsened symptoms rather than relieved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Women reported delays in receiving hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stop-smoking-nicotine-substitution-nrt-drug-2335895299"&gt;Andrey Popov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hormonal upheaval of menopause doesn’t occur in isolation. In midlife, women often juggle caring responsibilities, career pressures and domestic demands. These are pressures that layer on to the biological changes they’re experiencing, creating an intense mix of physical and emotional strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are now widely recognised to be losing jobs, relationships and, in some cases, their capacity to make decisions due to menopausal symptoms. Mood swings, anxiety, brain fog, hot flushes and feelings of profound sadness can be debilitating. Yet, for many, these symptoms are dismissed or misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dismissal has deep historical roots. The outdated diagnosis of female “hysteria” – a misogynistic label used to pathologise women’s emotions – once justified treatments as extreme as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4890704/"&gt;asylum confinement and electroconvulsive therapy&lt;/a&gt;. The word may be gone, but its legacy endures in the way women’s hormonal suffering is still minimised as exaggeration or overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs of change. In 2021, an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/menopause-and-the-workplace-how-to-enable-fulfilling-working-lives-government-response/menopause-and-the-workplace-how-to-enable-fulfilling-working-lives-government-response"&gt;independent UK government report&lt;/a&gt; made ten recommendations to support menopausal women in the workplace and beyond. And, in November 2024, clinical guidelines were updated to recommend psychological support for women experiencing early menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suicide risk for midlife women has not been adequately highlighted in menopause guidance – a gap that urgently needs addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many women in the study reported dramatic improvements in mental wellbeing and a reduction in suicidal thoughts after receiving timely HRT and support from healthcare professionals who actually listened. Some described their lives as becoming tolerable again after years of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all women will benefit from hormone replacement, but all deserve to have their hormones checked and to be offered treatment when appropriate. The choice should be theirs – informed, supported and taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silence around menopausal mental health has lasted too long. It’s time healthcare services recognised this crisis for what it is: a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
