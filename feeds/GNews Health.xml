In preclinical mouse models, terpenes such as geraniol and linalool significantly reduced chronic pain, providing promising alternatives to opioid medications and avoiding THC’s psychoactive side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terpenes appear to act through the adenosine A2a receptor, indicating a potential sedative mechanism. These findings open the door to developing novel, non-opioid therapeutic options for chronic and post-operative pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Terpenes:&lt;/strong&gt; Geraniol and linalool were the most effective terpenes in relieving fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opioid Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes could provide safer alternatives to opioids without psychoactive side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism of Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes relieve pain by targeting the adenosine A2a receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terpenes from the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant may be a viable medication for fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain relief, according to University of Arizona Health Sciences research published in &lt;em&gt;Pharmacological Reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds on previous research led by Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction member John Streicher, PhD, that showed the pain-relieving properties of terpenes in models of inflammation and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108140"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is showing that terpenes are not a good option for reducing acute pain resulting from an injury, such as stubbing your toe or touching a hot stove; however, we are seeing significant reductions in pain when terpenes are used for chronic or pathological pain,” said Streicher, who is a professor in the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson’s Department of Pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was the first to investigate the impact of terpenes in preclinical models of fibromyalgia and post-operative pain and expand the scope of potential pain-relieving treatments using terpenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher and the research team tested four terpenes found in moderate to high levels in &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;: geraniol, linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that each of the terpenes resulted in high levels of pain relief in mouse models of post-operative pain and fibromyalgia. Geraniol provided the most significant level of pain relief, followed by linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With fibromyalgia, there isn’t much understanding of what the pain state is, and there are not a lot of great options for treating it,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that terpenes may be a viable treatment option for fibromyalgia pain, which could potentially have a large impact and make a difference for an under-treated population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder that affects up to 5% of the world’s population, according to research published in Healthcare (Basel) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health estimates about 4 million U.S. adults have fibromyalgia, which affects women more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-surgical pain straddles the line between acute pain and chronic pain. It is usually short in duration, but it also involves physiological changes such as increased inflammation and sensitization of the body’s pain system that contribute to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Opioids do a good job controlling post-surgical pain, but they can cause constipation that can increase the chances of post-surgical complications such as adhesions,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are always looking for better options, and this study suggests that terpenes could be a novel therapeutic for post-operative pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, approximately 310 million major surgeries are performed each year, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research that is being done by Dr. Streicher’s lab on terpenes and their potential to help those who suffer from chronic pain demonstrates the importance of basic research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are hundreds of unique chemicals that plants make, including the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis&lt;/em&gt; plant, that are undiscovered,” said Todd Vanderah, PhD, director of the Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction at the U of A Health Sciences and professor and head of the Department of Pharmacology at the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Nature is incredible at making unique chemical structures, and many of these chemicals are unknowns when it comes to their abilities to aid in human health, diseases and disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great current example is medication semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, which has a chemical structure that was isolated not from a plant, but from an animal that is prevalent in the Southwest, the Gila monster. These discoveries from natural products through research such as Dr. Streicher’s can result in very useful medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the mechanism of action of terpenes on post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain was the same as in previous studies. Its action through the adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor – a receptor that caffeine targets and blocks – suggests a sedative effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher’s co-authors were Caleb Seekins, who worked in Streicher’s lab as an undergraduate biochemistry student and is now pursuing a medical degree at the College of Medicine – Tucson; Alyssa Welborn, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2024; and Abigail Schwarz, who finished her doctorate in Streicher’s lab in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health under award no.

Our lab found that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene relieve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy via Adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests terpenes as potential non-opioid, non-cannabinoid therapeutics. In this study, we investigated post-operative and fibromyalgia pain, expanding potential terpene applications to different pain types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female CD-1 mice had their baseline mechanical sensitivity measured via von Frey filaments and underwent either paw incision surgery or reserpine-induced fibromyalgia (0.32 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt;). After pain was established, the mice received 200 mg/kg &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt; of a terpene, and their mechanical sensitivity was measured over three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the potential mechanism of action, mice were given the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist istradefylline (3.2 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt;) 10 min before terpene, with mechanical sensitivity measured after. Hot plate pain testing was performed as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpene treatment caused time-dependent elevation of the mechanical thresholds of the mice from both pain models, strongest for geraniol, then linalool or α-humulene, indicating that these four terpenes are anti-nociceptive in post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretreatment with istradefylline blocked antinociception, suggesting the terpenes act via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R in these pain models. Terpenes had no effect on hot plate latencies, ruling out non-specific motor effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene may be a viable medication for post-operative and fibromyalgia pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mechanism of action via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R furthers our knowledge of its importance in pain processing and as a target of terpene drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:20:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1fYnh2RG1XR29lSlpnenhBQ0I2a245Y1lkRjdhOUM3ZjRMSVJsYl9GWFZvak5XWVJtNnpGcGdJem5lSEM2ekdSRXg4RjJzWEM2YUZOUGpTVFRXZDc4b3prRHo5emRYS1AyYVh4emFoY19aVGJGbWlEajU0WQ</guid></item><item><title>140 inmates treated for scabies after 1 tests positive at Utah State Prison - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQlFuT2F0T0JkLTlETS1PcFU0VmVHUFp5QmNyd3pabDZ0SFo3bzNfTXBKc2gySmhDdlB5QXg4czZsTThOVjBHaXpueWVlYTZvWDFvLV9YVnR4RG5xcExYX0VZY1J2bmZpYjUxeHZ4bWpEa2ZIQzRLR0pFUVlxSHBBMTdQeEE1RnVfeWV4eGM0MTVzZnhfaWhmMjdEVzhIblFyLU4tQmtlalJxRC14Qy15ZTBYOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The unit houses older, medically dependent men in four-bed pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other inmates in two sections of the same unit have tested negative at this point, but the unit is still being kept under quarantine and those in the two sections are being treated. The department said restrictions on visits and volunteer services to the unit are expected to be lifted by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is being provided following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes washing clothing and bedding in a disinfectant. The health department is also providing education about hygiene and preventing the spread of scabies to inmates and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scabies is an infestation from a mite that burrows into the upper level of a person's skin and lays eggs. It is typically spread by prolonged skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the health department said there has been ongoing issues with a skin rash, possibly caused by laundry soap, in multiple units at the prison that is not contagious. The rash makes it difficult to identify scabies cases without testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQlFuT2F0T0JkLTlETS1PcFU0VmVHUFp5QmNyd3pabDZ0SFo3bzNfTXBKc2gySmhDdlB5QXg4czZsTThOVjBHaXpueWVlYTZvWDFvLV9YVnR4RG5xcExYX0VZY1J2bmZpYjUxeHZ4bWpEa2ZIQzRLR0pFUVlxSHBBMTdQeEE1RnVfeWV4eGM0MTVzZnhfaWhmMjdEVzhIblFyLU4tQmtlalJxRC14Qy15ZTBYOA</guid></item><item><title>Oakland County sees Michigan's first measles case of 2025 - Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxQSWxpczBkckhPNlB4eW9ReWxrakd6SEtabkg0TTFBV2JqUlM2WkJlOHEyS1dOUmdQQzNxcGdoS0pTczdQNkh5M0pzclQ3UzBCQWNYOFhvcC1IcGdxdGdXQTlzZHAweThpOG1mdXBvaXc3RGhPSC1WM1k2blU1ODlMWHctcnpaUlh0bi1PTEh0SjZwWEVldEt2dkRUcjktYjFvV1BfbWJ4MXhtTHJ1UVBoVF9kUzFSUk1uQkFRQUwwb3Fya3RxOUxqOVNvT09BcEt4X01ZZGpDWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Oakland County confirmed Michigan's first measles case of 2025 on Friday, county executive spokesman Bill Mullan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The case is associated with recent international travel and there are possible exposures, Mullan said.

They also say they are unsure of that person's vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the patient returned home on February 27, first experienced symptoms on March 7, and the rash emerged on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the period of possible transmission is from March 3 to March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say they have identified two places where the public may have been exposed. They are the Emergency Room at Henry Ford Rochester on University Drive on both March 8 and March 10. The second location is the Kruse and Muir restaurant on Main in Rochester from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles virus stays active in the air for 2 hours after an infectious person leaves. Early symptoms you should be on the lookout for include fever, runny nose, and pink eye. If you are experiencing any of those symptoms, you should not seek treatment without calling the provider first so they can take appropriate precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Video: Can adults get a measles shot if they don't know their childhood vaccine status?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

Kathy Hochul to temporarily shut down markets in the New York City metro area to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wet markets reopened in mid-February, inspectors have found the virus in birds at &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seven more&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s roughly 70 wet markets, which remain open and serve thousands of customers weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture, which performs quarterly unannounced inspections and bird flu testing at the markets, said it may order another shutdown if clear evidence persists that bird flu is spreading in the live poultry business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have highlighted the city’s wet markets as environments where viruses spreading between animal species can mutate and potentially become more transmittable to humans. While there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html?cove-tab=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;70 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu spreading to humans nationwide since 2024 – including one fatality – none have been in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Jose Fernandez at La Granja market in West Harlem earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, New York City’s wet markets continue to sell thousands of birds a month, according to state data from 2023. One estimate from 2021 put the total at roughly 1 million live birds per month. Several customers interviewed for this story said they prefer the fresher, higher-quality meat from these markets, while others count on them for halal or other specific slaughter practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="streamfield-embed streamfield-embed-default streamfield-paragraph mb-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘The meat tastes completely different&lt;/b&gt;’&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Granja Live Poultry, an unassuming corner storefront in West Harlem next to an artisanal coffee roaster selling $7 espresso tonics, is quiet from the outside. But inside, cages packed with squawking chickens as well as turkeys, quails and even rabbits line the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend an hour there and you’ll hear a half-dozen languages, including Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Bengali. Owner Jose Fernandez, who has run the store since 1999, said he gets just about every type of customer you can imagine – except one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have too many customers that are white people, because they don’t cook too much,” Fernandez said, laughing. “They eat in the restaurant, so their life is very different. In my house we cook every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;A price list at La Granja market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, originally from the Dominican Republic, said his customers are mostly like him: people with roots in other countries who are used to eating chickens raised outside on a diet of corn, grass, and insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The meat tastes completely different from the meat you can buy at the supermarket or butcher,” Fernandez said in Spanish. “People who come here know the difference, the taste of real chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many of his customers follow halal or other dietary laws, Fernandez said, which require specific slaughter methods he can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said he sells about 4,000 chickens a week, he said, along with small numbers of game birds and rabbits. The corkboard walls of his tiny office at the front of the store are covered with supplier invoices and the business cards of various officials at the federal and state Departments of Agriculture. He said his store underwent regular unannounced inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the shop floor, staff regularly sweep and hose down the tile. Behind a counter in the back, birds are plucked and processed in about eight minutes, returning whole or in pieces, encased in plastic and resembling the chicken sold at the Whole Foods a few blocks east (though considerably cheaper at $3.20 per pound versus $4.49 per pound advertised at the Whole Foods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Customers examine the live birds at La Granja earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Cardenas, originally from Ecuador, recently picked up two chickens at La Granja – “The Farm,” in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re better this way,” Cardenas said in Spanish. “For my health, I prefer fresh. When they’re slaughtered here and I can see the blood drain, I know I’m eating something fresh that won’t make me sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the risks of shopping at wet markets outweigh any benefits. While properly cooked eggs and meat are safe to eat, a wide body of literature has identified such markets as high-risk sites for transmitting disease from animals to humans – most notably as &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-03-11/what-caused-covid-19-what-we-know-5-years-later" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a potential origin&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live poultry markets create ideal conditions for this “zoonotic” transmission, according to Ann Linder, associate director of policy and research at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Animal-Markets-and-Zoonotic-Disease-Risk-high-resolution.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined disease transmission at wet markets in 15 countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds from multiple farms are mixed together, increasing the risk that one may carry a pathogen, she said. Because they are packed into tight quarters, often in stressful conditions that weaken their immune systems, they become more vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the ongoing bird flu outbreak, which started in 2022 and picked up sharply again this year, is largely concentrated in major “factory farm” producers in the Midwest, that doesn’t guarantee that the city’s wet markets are safe, Linder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Owner Jose Fernandez says most of his customers shop at La Granja because they prefer the taste of fresh chicken, or they have dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a constant influx of new birds and new potential pathogens,” Linder said, referring to the fact that birds are sourced from multiple farms. She said wet markets are especially risky because customers examine the birds up close and the animals are slaughtered on site, potentially creating more avenues for transmission. Additionally, she said that because wet markets often operate in dense, residential neighborhoods in New York City, an outbreak that starts here could be especially hard to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more bird flu detections at the city’s wet markets since their reopening than before the initial shutdown, activists, city councilmembers, and even Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa are questioning why they remain open. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to bird flu, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States there have been 70 cases of bird flu detected in humans since the current outbreak began spiking again in 2024, with one fatality reported in Louisiana in January. For now, the disease does not appear to spread easily from animals to humans, but public health experts expressed concern that it will mutate to become more easily transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally don’t think there’s anything any market could do to actually be shut down,” said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights organization New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birnkrant has been documenting conditions at some of the city’s wet markets for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds,” Birnkrant said of a store in Queens that she visited on Tuesday. “Many we found with open wounds because the birds are cannibalizing each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantal Fernandez, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Health, said that while her agency provides guidance to workers on proper protective equipment and handling dead birds, they don’t have a specific program to educate consumers about the risks these markets pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarra Jagne, a professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine who has studied Northeast U.S. bird markets extensively, said that strict regulations introduced in 2003 made the markets much safer, such as one mandating that different species be caged separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent cases of bird flu in markets are to be expected given the ongoing national outbreak, she said, but do not highlight an inherent problem with the markets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to many, many of these markets, and the change from before is just enormous,” Jarra said, referring to the period before the 2003 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at La Granja, Fernandez said the state’s monitoring and detection program is sufficient for him and his customers to feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand surged after the weeklong shutdown before business normalized and then slowed a little, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not sure why. It could be the economy, he said. But most likely it’s the usual seasonal pattern – his customers often give up meat for Lent and Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUzVLaU05UTdxLW1YdHNrbHVUX0l2TEtOTkxuNXNIRExtQVBqUUpqNUpkelZvSVZnbXNWc28wQVhrM3FyYkFwT0VxeEt0eng2RzlWSVc5VERrWDZJd1pCSFNncFVlWEY3aTRVUllpclhJZVRucVNTcHZ0QXZkRWFnS1BKcjRtbm80ZHo4Ti04Nmc5T1JvYkZ4eUpjako2dWc</guid></item><item><title>Top nutrition expert shares the No. 1 mistake he sees in American diets - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-fac7c12f-7 ifTevn"&gt;&lt;img alt="photo of Tim Spector." data-content-placement="primary_image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="impression-element" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=75 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=75 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=75 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=75 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=75 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=75 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=75 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;p data-cy="caption" class="sc-13b6974d-9 dKtuAn"&gt;“We’re often failing in nutrition to think about…what does your plate look like,” gut health expert and epidemiologist Tim Spector says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-cy="credit" class="sc-13b6974d-10 hbPqHz"&gt;Mike Marsland—Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c</guid></item><item><title>I Got Cancer Just As COVID Hit.

Five years ago, at age 46, just as the other big “C” was hitting the United States, I found a lump in my breast. I was reminded of this last month when I had my bi-yearly scans, which showed (thankfully) I’m still cancer-free. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five years is a big deal in cancer terms because if you make it that long without any recurrence, the chances of it coming back drop significantly. When I announced this news to a group of friends, it was met with encouraging sentiments and applause. I was touched but not surprised. I knew that “C” was the one I could talk about; it was the other one I couldn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned this lesson early on, in the spring of 2021, sitting at a barbecue. After surgery and treatments, I had been quarantined in my house for almost a year, and this was one of my first social outings. Perched on an outdoor sofa, I listened to two women beside me talk about how the virus had affected their children’s sports schedules and how boring their social lives had been during the last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Enough is enough,” one of them said with so much conviction you’d think she was a lawyer trying a case. “The whole thing was a bunch of bullshit!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I excused myself, went to the bathroom, sat on a closed toilet seat, and cried. Had we just had the same year? It felt like they must have been living in some kind of parallel universe. Did they not understand what it was like in the hospital? How could they want to just go on with their lives without at least acknowledging the depth of what had just happened to the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memories from those early days of COVID haunted me: the sidewalk outside the hospital where I sobbed as I hugged my husband goodbye on the day of my surgery. The terror in every set of eyes I met once inside. The empty hallways. The workers in full PPE. The way the nurses would do their best &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to touch me. The patient who was rolled past me in a hospital bed with a plastic hood over his head. The caution tape. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the doctor said, “If you get the virus, we won’t be able to treat you.” How I scrubbed my skin raw each time I returned home. How I laid awake night after night, wondering if tomorrow would be the day I’d catch the virus and die. How I needed a good mask, but there were none to buy and watched protesters on the news raging against having to wear one at all. How the government said not to panic, but more people got sick and died. And how the president said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZgJZgFZbU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Just stay calm.

The consensus seemed to be that we, as a society, needed to move on from COVID as fast as possible without looking back — no time for reflection, no time for empathy, no time for remembrance. And for the most part, we did just that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were indications this may not have been the best plan — after the pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cases of depression and anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d325d0e4b0e72dd7fee7df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cases of depression and anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; rose significantly.

This thing that happened was in my DNA now whether I wanted it to be or not. And although I could see the attraction to put the blinders on, I just couldn’t seem to keep them up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The empty hospital where the author received treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It started with anxiety attacks in crowded places. It moved on to ruminating over the slightest changes in my body — a tickle in my throat, a headache, a sneeze. The COVID and the cancer were enmeshed in my mind, so much so that a part of me believed if I succumbed to the first, the other would surely follow. My thoughts, which before the pandemic, had been filled with things like work assignments, my own kid’s game schedules and social plans, were overtaken by an all-consuming fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when friends asked, “How are you doing?” I always replied, “Good,” because that is what I should’ve been, even if I wasn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logic told me if I acted like the person I was in March of 2020, I would become her again. So, I said yes when I got invitations, even though I wanted to say no. I smiled through cocktail parties and work events. I told myself: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is what people do, and the more you do it, the easier it will get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I took the subway, went to the theater, traveled, and said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If all these other people are doing it, it must be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even when, amid those things, I did get a mild case of COVID and recovered, the anxiety remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The aftermath of a traumatic event can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and problems with emotional regulation (such as irritability and anger). I was experiencing almost all of those things and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew I couldn’t suppress them any longer, so I began therapy. Week after week, I told my story, and as I did, the worry finally began to fade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned that a common coping mechanism when people experience trauma is a detachment from thoughts and feelings. And as I grasped how this was true in relation to myself, I started to wonder: Is that what we, as a society, have done as well? After enduring one period of isolation, did we forgo grieving collectively in the aftermath to avoid feeling things that were too hard to hold? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, I live very much the way I did before COVID and cancer, but at times, I still feel my body tensing around crowds and unpredictable situations. And although I now have the tools to manage these moments, I wonder if they will ever go away. Just as having cancer has forever changed me, COVID did, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am not the same person I was before March of 2020, and neither are you. Whether we like it or not, we have all been changed by the other big “C.” Our COVID stories matter — whether they be from a first grader who missed their little league season, a teenager who had to do school online from the confines of their bedroom, a frontline worker, a grandparent who went a year without a hug, a once healthy adult who now suffers from long COVID, or one of the millions of people who lost a loved one. These experiences shaped us into the people we are today, they are a part of us now. To say those truths out loud is to know we were never alone, even when we were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list takeaway-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories and can boost exercise performance by improving blood flow to muscles during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mice with enhanced brown fat lived 20% longer and showed 30% better exercise performance, with the benefits transferable through tissue transplantation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rutgers researchers are developing a drug that could activate brown fat in humans, potentially helping people maintain physical fitness as they age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. —&lt;/strong&gt; The next breakthrough in anti-aging medicine might come from a surprising source: fat. But not just any fat—brown fat, a special type that burns energy rather than storing it. Researchers at Rutgers University are developing a pill that could boost this beneficial tissue’s activity, after discovering its remarkable effects on exercise capacity and lifespan in mice. Their work suggests that activating brown fat could be the key to staying physically fit as we age, with a drug potentially available for testing within a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/206179/text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brown fat&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just for keeping us warm—it actively contributes to better exercise performance and potentially extends our healthy years. The paper, authored by Dorothy E. Vatner, Jie Zhang, and Stephen F. Vatner from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, offers a fresh perspective on fat tissue and its surprising connections to exercise capacity and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Exercise capacity diminishes as you get older, and to have a technique that could enhance exercise performance would be very beneficial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthful aging&lt;/a&gt;,” said Stephen Vatner, university professor and director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute in the medical school’s Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine and senior author of the study, in a statement. “This mouse model performs exercise better than their normal littermates.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-fat-is-created-equal"&gt;Not All Fat Is Created Equal&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people think of fat as something to lose, but brown fat, (also known as brown adipose tissue) &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brown-fat-protects-from-chronic-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;works differently&lt;/a&gt; from the white fat we typically try to shed. This special tissue burns calories rather than storing them, generating heat through a process called thermogenesis. While scientists have known about brown fat’s heat-producing abilities for decades, the connection between the tissue and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise performance&lt;/a&gt; represents a fascinating new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rutgers team has been studying a particular genetic model—mice lacking a protein called regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14)—that exhibit dramatically &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extended lifespans&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced exercise performance. Their research found that these long-lived mice have more potent brown fat, which appears to be directly responsible for their impressive physical abilities and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The color difference between white and brown fat isn’t just cosmetic. Brown fat cells contain numerous mitochondria—cellular power plants that give these cells their distinctive brown color. These mitochondria are packed with a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which allows them to generate heat instead of the usual cellular energy currency, ATP. This metabolic flexibility makes brown fat uniquely positioned to influence whole-body energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impressive-results-from-brown-fat-transplantation"&gt;Impressive Results From Brown Fat Transplantation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ most compelling evidence comes from transplantation experiments. When they transplanted brown fat from the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice into normal mice, the recipients experienced dramatically enhanced exercise performance within just three days. In contrast, normal mice receiving brown fat transplants from other normal mice also showed improvement—but only after eight weeks. This suggests that the brown fat from the long-lived mice possesses unique properties that can rapidly boost exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists say that the transplanted brown fat increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the legs during exercise, promoting better oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles. It also stimulated the formation of new blood vessels and increased the density of existing ones. In essence, the brown fat was helping to build a more efficient circulatory system for delivering fuel during physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice produced unusually high amounts of active brown fat and showed about 30% better exercise performance than normal mice, both in speed and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/muscles-exercise-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time to exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, several pathways appear to be activated by the enhanced brown fat, including SIRT3 (a longevity-associated protein), MEK/ERK signaling, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These pathways collectively improve mitochondrial function, reduce &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance blood flow—all critical factors for exercise performance and potentially for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-better-with-brown-fat"&gt;Aging Better With Brown Fat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection to aging becomes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-cup-of-coffee-activates-calorie-burning-brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;even more apparent&lt;/a&gt; when examining the physical appearance of the genetically modified mice. Normal mice show typical signs of aging—&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;graying fur,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hair-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, and general body atrophy—but the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice maintain a more youthful appearance well into old age. Even at advanced ages, they maintain a healthier appearance, avoiding the typical signs of aging that appear in normal elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modified mice live &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/flexibility-key-to-longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about 20% longer&lt;/a&gt; than normal mice, with females living longer than males – similar to the pattern seen in humans. While the paper doesn’t explore the gender difference in depth, it raises intriguing questions about sex hormones and their potential interaction with brown adipose tissue function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical applications extend far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-home-gyms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the gym&lt;/a&gt;. If brown fat truly has the protective effects suggested by this research, it could become a therapeutic target for preventing or treating a host of age-related conditions. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are all mentioned as potential conditions that might respond to brown fat-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With all the medical advances, aging and longevity have increased in humans, but unfortunately, healthful aging hasn’t,” Vatner said. “There are a lot of diseases associated with aging – obesity, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cancer – and what we have to do is find new drugs based on models of healthful aging.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-real-life"&gt;From Lab to Real Life&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than develop a treatment that addresses aging broadly, which poses regulatory challenges, Vatner said his team plans to test for specific benefits such as improved exercise capacity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This approach builds on their previous success in developing a drug based on a different mouse healthful longevity model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with some people to develop this agent, and hopefully, in another year or so, we’ll have a drug that we can test,” Vatner said. He added that most people would prefer to increase brown fat levels by taking pills rather than ice baths and is optimistic about translating the newest finding into an effective medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wondering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/off-switch-brown-fat-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how to activate&lt;/a&gt; their own brown fat now, current science suggests that cold exposure is one of the most effective natural stimulants. When we’re cold, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, which binds to receptors on brown fat cells and activates UCP1-mediated heat production. In the meantime, techniques such as deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat naturally. Studies have found such efforts to produce short-term benefits that range from enhanced immune system function to improved metabolic health, but Vatner said none of the studies have run long enough to find any effect on healthful aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the path from these mouse studies to human applications remains uncertain, but study authors are hopeful that a brown fat-activating drug is in reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically modified mouse lacking the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14 knockout mice), which they compared to normal mice. To determine if brown fat was responsible for the benefits they observed, the team performed transplantation experiments, surgically moving brown fat from RGS14 KO mice into normal mice, then testing the recipients’ exercise performance on specialized treadmills. They measured hind limb blood flow using imaging techniques and examined tissue samples for signs of new blood vessel formation. The team also analyzed molecular markers to identify the specific cellular pathways involved in the effects of brown fat on exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-and-limitations"&gt;Results and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice lived about 20% longer than normal mice and showed approximately 30% better exercise performance. When brown fat from these mice was transplanted into normal mice, the recipients experienced enhanced exercise capacity within just three days, compared to the eight weeks needed for normal mice receiving brown fat from other normal mice. The improved performance came with increased blood flow to the hind limbs and higher density of blood vessels in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. Mouse models don’t always translate directly to human physiology, and the transplantation approach isn’t directly applicable as a human intervention. The paper also notes inconsistent findings in the field regarding the effects of exercise on brown fat, suggesting complex relationships that may vary based on intensity, duration, and individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;

They urged New Yorkers not to feed their pets raw food or raw milk and to avoid letting them roam outside where they could encounter wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk that bird flu presents to New Yorkers remains low, the health department said. Human-to-human transmission of the avian influenza virus remains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt; and has not occurred during the current outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is possible for someone to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Other%20animals%20infected%20with%20avian,or%20mouth%2C%20or%20is%20inhaled." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;contract bird&lt;/a&gt; flu from an animal if they come into contact with the animal’s organs, blood or other bodily fluids, including milk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2022, 70 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and one has died, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3f2s000d3b6muukucs34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far in 2025, there have been at least 308 measles cases reported in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, there were 285 measles cases. The high numbers are driven by a large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000i3b6m47ifgdpy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the years since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 measles cases reported each year. There have been an average of about 8 outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But the worst outbreaks each year typically stay under 50 cases. 2025 is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year that an outbreak has led to more than 200 cases. The others were the Disneyland outbreak that started in 2014 and 2019 when a nearly year-long outbreak in New York came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000j3b6mv5itxvem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death – a school-aged child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico said last week they are investigating the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles. The Lea County resident had not sought out health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Pictured above is virologist Shi Zhengli, known as 'Batwoman' for her work on coronaviruses in Wuhan. Some suggest that the Covid pandemic was triggered by a leak from her laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS is a contagious respiratory illness spread from animals to humans and from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS — both in May 2014 — and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worldwide, the virus has triggered 2,613 cases and 943 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the research, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.70173?logout=true"&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took 423 oral and rectal swabs from 15 species of bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab analyses revealed the seven coronavirus strains were genetically different to any known pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses were found in the velvety free-tailed bat and great fruit-eating bat, which both live across South America and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Defending the paper, virologist Dr Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, who was also involved in the research, said: 'Bats are important viral reservoirs and should thereofre be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This monitoring helps identify circulating viruses and risks of transmission to other animals, and even to humans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421599/coronavirus-potential-cause-pandemic-discovered-china.html"&gt;three weeks&lt;/a&gt; after scientists in China revealed they had discovered yet another coronavirus that could spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scenes eerily reminiscent of the beginnings of the Covid pandemic, researchers at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology detected the new strain living within bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is strikingly similar to the pandemic virus, sparking fears that history could repeat itself just two years after the worst was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Update:  since the public meeting of the vaccine advisory committee was cancelled, representatives of the CDC, FDA, and Department of Defense (!) met in closed session to decide to use the WHO selections of which strains to use for this fall's flu vaccines.  So there will be vaccines, RFKJr can take a hike. He probably does less damage when he's away hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traveler came through LAX airport on March 5 in the evening, and is now a confirmed measles case.  They also visited a nail salon and a grocery store while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Europe had  32,265 measles cases, the vast majority of them in Romania. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-reports-first-measles-case-2025-lax-traveler-cases-confirmed-philadelphia-ny" target="_blank"&gt;More than 27,000 of them&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the great majority were unvaccinated. Ten Europeans died of measles in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-years-pandemic-world-poorly.html" target="_blank"&gt;We aren't ready for the next pandemic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH cancelled dozens of studies into vaccine hesitancy and ways to increase vaccine uptake.  Because they want us to get sick, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/nih-cuts-research-grants-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-vaccine-studies-next-target" target="_blank"&gt;Not enough Rs in GRRRRRRR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Michigan counties have now found chronic wasting disease in farmed deer.  It was first noted in wild deer in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings challenge traditional assumptions about exercise and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Jyväskylä examined how long-term physical activity affects mortality and whether it can counteract genetic risks for disease. The team also explored role of exercise in biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts analyzed 22,750 Finnish twins born before 1958. Their leisure-time &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-reduces-the-risk-of-brain-diseases-by-up-to-54-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; was assessed in 1975, 1981, and 1990. The researchers followed up on mortality data through the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moderate-activity-yields-maximum-benefits"&gt;Moderate activity yields maximum benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified four activity groups: sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. Over 30 years, the biggest difference was found between the sedentary and moderately active groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderately active individuals had a 7% lower mortality risk. However, those in the highly active group did not show additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strength-training-may-be-the-best-exercise-for-insomnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, more physical activity correlated with lower mortality. However, in the long run, highly active individuals had no advantage over those who were sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An underlying pre-disease state can limit physical activity and ultimately lead to death, not the lack of exercise itself,” said Professor Elina Sillanpää from the Faculty of Sports and Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can bias the association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-guidelines-and-mortality-risk"&gt;Exercise guidelines and mortality risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts also evaluated whether following World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) physical activity guidelines influenced mortality and genetic disease risk. The WHO recommends 150–300 minutes of moderate or 75–150 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study showed that meeting these guidelines did not lower mortality risk. Even twins who followed the recommendations for 15 years showed no significant difference in mortality rates compared to their less active siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widely observed favorable association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality are based on observational studies that are prone to bias from different sources,” noted postdoctoral researcher Laura Joensuu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our studies, we aimed to account for various sources of biases, and combined with the long follow-up period, we could not confirm that adhering to physical activity guidelines mitigates genetic cardiovascular disease risk or causally reduces mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-and-biological-aging"&gt;Exercise and biological aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a subset of twins, the researchers analyzed biological aging using epigenetic clocks. These clocks estimate biological aging based on chemical markers that regulate gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a U-shaped pattern. Both the least and most active individuals experienced accelerated biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the association between leisure-time physical activity and biological aging was U-shaped: Biological aging was accelerated in those who exercised the least and the most,” said Sillanpää.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol use played a major role in the link between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and biological aging. The study also examined genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease and blood pressure using polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-exercise-does-not-slow-aging"&gt;More exercise does not slow aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research challenges the widely held belief that more exercise always leads to a longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical activity is beneficial for overall health, its impact on longevity is more complicated than previously assumed. Moderate exercise appears to offer the best balance, while excessive activity does not necessarily add extra years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the importance of considering other factors, such as lifestyle habits and genetic predisposition. Exercise alone may not be enough to overcome genetic risks. Other aspects of health, such as diet, stress management, and avoiding harmful habits, play a crucial role in aging and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may further clarify the relationship between physical activity and lifespan. In the meantime, individuals should aim for a balanced approach to exercise, focusing on overall well-being rather than just lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved researchers from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and the Methodology Centre for Human Sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jyväskylä&lt;/a&gt;.

The short-term physical effects on &lt;a href="https://www.drugfreect.org/substance-info/alcohol/short-term-effects/"&gt;cognition and motor function&lt;/a&gt; speak for themselves. The longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/addiction-heavy-drinking"&gt;physical consequences of abusing alcohol&lt;/a&gt; — liver damage, jaundice, and cancer — have long been impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So why, in that case, has there been a widespread belief, even among many physicians, that moderate drinking might actually be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We can thank the so-called French paradox for this. In the early 1990s, French scientist &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51361649_Serge_Renaud_from_French_paradox_to_Cretan_miracle"&gt;Serge Renaud concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the French had low rates of cardiovascular disease despite their affinity for fatty foods like beef and cheese because they otherwise adhere to a healthy &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; — and because they consumed “moderate” amounts of red wine. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281#:~:text=Resveratrol%20in%20red%20wine,More%20research%20is%20needed."&gt;theorized that the antioxidants in red wine&lt;/a&gt; could play a role in reducing cholesterol, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Subsequent studies appeared to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193755"&gt;affirm the correlation&lt;/a&gt;, strengthening the belief among the general public about the benefits of red wine. But over the past decade, new studies and &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155"&gt;public health warnings&lt;/a&gt; have called that conventional wisdom into question, stating emphatically that no level of alcohol consumption could be considered safe — much less beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alcohol after all, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health"&gt;absolutely is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;, and has long been recognized by experts, if not the broader public, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html"&gt;as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since many people enjoy alcohol to some extent, says Timothy Naimi, director of the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, “there’s been a far more relaxed scientific standard.” “We all love studies that show, ‘oh, sex makes us live longer, or coffee is good for us, or chocolate is good for us.’ There is this irresistible idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Science has clearly established that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html"&gt;excessive drinking is bad for you&lt;/a&gt;. But what remains confusing, especially with the steady stream of new studies that sometimes seem to contradict each other, is how bad moderate drinking is — and what “moderate” even means. Here’s what we actually know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="moderate-drinking-is-elusive-and-its-very-easy-to-drink-too-much" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Moderate” drinking is elusive — and it’s very easy to drink too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the most important things to understand about drinking and its health effects is what amount of alcohol is actually considered to be excessive. It is &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/is-it-time-to-rethink-how-much-you-drink"&gt;a common trope&lt;/a&gt; among doctors and alcohol researchers that people misunderstand what moderate drinking means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“None of us like to think of ourselves as drinking to excess, right?” Naimi said. “Who among us wants to think of ourselves as immoderate? Of course, we’re all moderate drinkers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Diners in Paris.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Corbis/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even if we agree in colloquial terms that “one drink a night” is moderate, the details matter. Medical science has far more &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2024/12/americas-most-common-drug-problem-unhealthy-alcohol-use"&gt;precise definitions for what constitutes a “drink”&lt;/a&gt; than the average person pouring themselves a glass of Chablis. One 12-ounce can of 5-percent alcohol beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine with 12-percent alcohol, or a 1.5-ounce glass of 80-proof liquor are all what constitutes a “standard drink.” So when we pour an extra-large glass of wine at night, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; may consider it only one drink, but a doctor sees two or even three. The kind of beer or wine matters too: Your favorite 9 percent IPA is actually closer to two drinks than it is to one, according to medical definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People today are considered by the medical establishment to be heavy drinkers if, by these definitions, they consume more than 15 drinks in a week for men or more than eight drinks for women. (You are considered to have &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt; if you have tried to stop drinking in the past year but failed, have alcohol cravings, or believe drinking interferes with your life. It’s less about specific amounts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below that threshold, based on these scientific standards, you might consider yourself to be a so-called moderate drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This reflects a lot of progress in our understanding of problematic drinking. For centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-conflicted-history-of-alcohol-in-western-civilization/"&gt;people have known that excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; could damage the liver, cause long-term health problems, and lead to alcohol dependence. The US temperance movement of the 1800s and early 1900s sought to eradicate those personal and social harms and briefly succeeded in outlawing alcohol during the Prohibition era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, as the failure of Prohibition attests, drinking is deeply embedded in our society. Some popular historians like to say that &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/alcohol-caffeine-created-civilization"&gt;alcohol (along with caffeine) helped define human civilization&lt;/a&gt;. There may even be &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(24)00240-4"&gt;an evolutionary angle&lt;/a&gt;: Many animals consume alcohol (called ethanol when it is encountered naturally). Perhaps it’s because finding fruit with some fermented ethanol means you’re good at finding fruit, period — a natural advantage for survival. That is how deeply rooted our ancestral relationship to alcohol might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even today, one of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211338/"&gt;scheduled around drinking&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;let’s go to happy hour&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;grab some drinks for the big game&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Given the seemingly implacability of social drinking, the focus for a long time has been trying to reduce the kind of habitual, excessive drinking that we have historically called alcoholism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And there was some progress made: Americans collectively report &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_05-png/"&gt;consuming less alcohol than they did&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s and ’80s. Today, an estimated 10 percent of Americans 12 and older are &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; as having alcohol use disorder, a number that has stayed fairly stable over the past decade. There is even evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_03-png/"&gt;younger people are drinking &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than millennials or Gen X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, however, alcohol-related deaths have been increasing, rising by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-the-latest-alcohol-death-data-and-change-over-the-last-decade/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 to 2022, even with a definition of alcohol-related deaths that is limited to liver disease, poisoning and accidents. The actual count, when considering deaths to which alcohol was at least a contributor, such as cancer in heavy drinkers, is more difficult to quantify but likely much higher. A 2024 estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number at &lt;a href="/the-highlight/2023/11/6/23931877/alcohol-use-disorder-leading-cause-deaths-medication-therapy"&gt;178,000 deaths attributable to alcohol overuse&lt;/a&gt; annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These seemingly contradictory trends — stable rates of alcoholism, but increasing deaths — could be explained by a few things. For one, alcohol use disorder is likely underdiagnosed. Second, “heavy” drinkers may not be alcoholics, but they can still feel the negative health effects of their alcohol use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And then there is an issue that has been worrying doctors for years: &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/binge-drinking"&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, usually defined as consuming four (for women) or five (for men) drinks in two hours or less. You may not necessarily be considered an alcoholic if you binge-drink; you may not even be a heavy drinker much of the time. But even more limited episodes of such intense drinking can do serious damages; the immediate risk is death from an accident or alcohol poisoning, but repeated binge drinking raises the risk of longer-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put it all together and what’s become clear is that more people’s health is being put at risk by their alcohol use than was previously realized. And that means even people whose drinking is considered socially acceptable need to be aware of the threats it poses to their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-any-level-of-drinking-safe-or-even-beneficial" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Is any level of drinking safe or even beneficial?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once you are having more than two drinks a day if you’re a man or one drink a day if you’re a woman, pretty much every researcher agrees that the health risks warrant trying to cut back. But the consensus fractures below that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If we imagine the conversation about alcohol’s health effects as a football field, the consensus covers 95 yards of the 100-yard field — almost all the way to the goal of general unanimity. We all agree heavy drinking is bad, but the fight remains on the issue — the remaining five yards — of whether &lt;em&gt;light &lt;/em&gt;drinking is truly bad and that is still being debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a quarter century after that conventional wisdom about red wine benefitting the human heart really took hold, a growing number of public health organizations and researchers started to aggressively dispute the idea that moderate alcohol consumption could be “safe” or beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“All of the arguing in the past 20 years has been around the health effects of very, very small amounts of alcohol,” Naimi said. “But I don’t think that other than small amounts of alcohol, there’s any question that alcohol consumption is a leading and preventable cause of health and social problems in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;One of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is scheduled around drinking.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One watershed moment was a 2017 publication from the American Society of Clinical Oncology that established that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112463/"&gt;even modest drinking could increase a person’s risk of developing cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The ASCO was alarmed by surveys that found only one in three Americans knew about the finding decades after medical literature had documented a link between, for example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3574368/"&gt;alcohol use and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And with its report, the group aimed to increase awareness among the public that alcohol is a carcinogen and advocate for specific policy strategies to try to reduce excessive alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5440363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, also published in 2017, examined prior research alleging positive cardiovascular effects from moderate alcohol consumption. This analysis, which Naimi co-authored, found possible statistical errors and other countervailing factors in the earlier studies that appeared to support the French paradox’s framework. For example, moderate wine drinkers tend to be more moderate in general, more active, and in better overall health — all of which could help explain their better health outcomes, without alcohol factoring into it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, some of the apparent abstainers studied in the various observational studies of alcohol use and health outcomes &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.15433#:~:text=The%20present%20research%20reaffirms%20previous,an%20alcohol%2Drelated%20health%20condition."&gt;may be former drinkers&lt;/a&gt; who could still feel the health effects years later, which would explain the finding that some moderate drinkers live longer than both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. More recent studies with more rigorous statistical randomization reported that “alcohol consumption of all amounts was associated with increased cardiovascular risk,” with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/"&gt;risk increasing with every drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 2022, the World Health Organization took an even stronger position, stating that “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health#:~:text=The%20risks%20and%20harms%20associated,that%20does%20not%20affect%20health."&gt;no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health&lt;/a&gt;” based on available evidence. As they put it, one’s risk appears to increase “from the first drop.” The board of scientists who advise the US government on diet guidelines, too, has advised that the guidance reduce the maximum recommended drinks for men from two to one daily, for example. Their input hasn’t yet been incorporated into the final federal dietary guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, you still have studies that came out in the past decade that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4981808/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;acknowledged the cancer risks but&lt;/a&gt; continued to report &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646330/"&gt;cardiovascular benefits&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26843157/"&gt;possible reduction in the risk of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; with modest drinking. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218856/"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that adhering to certain patterns — such as spacing your weekly allotment of drinks out over a few days and consuming them with a meal — may be beneficial. It’s understandable that people are confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s what you should know: This is really hard to study. We are mostly relying on observational data, not randomized controlled experiments, which could be compromised by all kinds of confounding factors. In an ideal world, you could compare two groups of people who are alike, except one drinks and the other doesn’t, for life. But in practice, that’s very difficult to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixj _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="industry-influence-has-shaped-our-ideas-about-alcohol-consumption" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry influence has shaped our ideas about alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our ability to make sense of all of the confusing science around drinking is further complicated by the influence of the alcohol industry, which airs advertising campaigns with messages like “drink responsibly” that reinforce the idea that a certain level of drinking can be responsible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;The industry also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/24/alcohol-tax-increases-stymied-by-industry-lobbyists-campaign-contributions/"&gt;lobbies lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to stymie any attempt to place new restrictions, requirements or taxes on them. One attempt to stand up a randomized alcohol study, which was to be overseen by Kenneth Mukamal of Harvard, was &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-end-funding-moderate-alcohol-cardiovascular-health-trial"&gt;shut down in 2018 because the alcohol industry&lt;/a&gt; had provided improper input on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of the researchers I spoke to acknowledged the challenge in substantiating alcohol’s effects, positive or negative, but again: Alcohol is a carcinogen; no one needs a randomized control trial to know that, it’s been the international consensus for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a reckoning with alcohol right now, which can leave people feeling unmoored. But all of this noise obscures the simple way to synthesize all of this: Less is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I think for people that are light drinkers, they probably don’t need to put a ton of brain space here,” Noelle LoConte, who co-authored the ASCO’s 2017 statement on alcohol and cancer, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you want to drink less but not abstain completely, there are some obvious things you can do. Don’t pour too much wine in that glass. Maybe skip the 10 percent double IPA. In my own life, I have moderated my drinking by limiting myself to at most two nights per week and at most two drinks per night. I still get to enjoy my coveted Cabernet once in a while, but having some loose rules for myself has made it easier to reduce my intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The people who have one drink with dinner or two drinks with dinner, I think it’s exactly the right way to do it; that’s the right way to calibrate it,” Kenneth Mukamal, a Harvard doctor who authored several of the studies finding some cardiovascular benefits to moderate alcohol consumption, said. “You should have it with food. You should have it with friends and have it in a way that you’re naturally limited in how much you’re going to drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is also getting easier — and less awkward — to not drink at all if that’s your preference or you simply want to make a change. The &lt;a href="/culture/24127542/alcohol-alternatives-kava-shrooms-weed-sleepygirl-mocktail"&gt;nonalcoholic drink market is flourishing&lt;/a&gt;, with better and better options coming to bars and restaurants. It should be more socially accepted &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to drink, as fewer people do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All things in moderation is classic health advice — and the same applies to alcohol: Don’t overthink (or over-drink).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1FX0ZvVXc0MHFqaUF0MXYtY0RHblJsV2U2Z0tzdlBYRTR6U1Q1YThna290ZEtWMzJaazZ0bzlmUllnc2o4VjZGYUtfX1hzWDlMSlBsYksyV0hmSTJkU3ljZTl6TnF5clBQN21Idl9nMUNwQXBiTkR5bnhzV1NBdw</guid></item><item><title>Dr. King Holmes, UW's first global health chair and a pioneer in studying STIs, dies at 87 - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUmM3b2xsT29NRlRhNE1sX3l1WHhGamhtYS10cUJsdnJPYmtiVEp5OXdDdlNEcUxLZmVCNmZQX181TkQ0THlMTGNNZkVWYk16TUZ3cHAyN3BubmJVaXBndF9MRS1RcFBfMFFoc1c5ZXV4QlBDZV9pVGhkR1FLc2tzUVEzdXlkcWxmRXJjU1lQTkpiMHlQUW81WDZpMzgwVGNad2MwR3NYeDR0ZDB1dFFQMjlfZlpzQVZYTmxoRV9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUmM3b2xsT29NRlRhNE1sX3l1WHhGamhtYS10cUJsdnJPYmtiVEp5OXdDdlNEcUxLZmVCNmZQX181TkQ0THlMTGNNZkVWYk16TUZ3cHAyN3BubmJVaXBndF9MRS1RcFBfMFFoc1c5ZXV4QlBDZV9pVGhkR1FLc2tzUVEzdXlkcWxmRXJjU1lQTkpiMHlQUW81WDZpMzgwVGNad2MwR3NYeDR0ZDB1dFFQMjlfZlpzQVZYTmxoRV9n?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. King Holmes, UW's first global health chair and a pioneer in studying STIs, dies at 87&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUmM3b2xsT29NRlRhNE1sX3l1WHhGamhtYS10cUJsdnJPYmtiVEp5OXdDdlNEcUxLZmVCNmZQX181TkQ0THlMTGNNZkVWYk16TUZ3cHAyN3BubmJVaXBndF9MRS1RcFBfMFFoc1c5ZXV4QlBDZV9pVGhkR1FLc2tzUVEzdXlkcWxmRXJjU1lQTkpiMHlQUW81WDZpMzgwVGNad2MwR3NYeDR0ZDB1dFFQMjlfZlpzQVZYTmxoRV9n</guid></item><item><title>Topical steroid withdrawal diagnostic criteria defined by NIH researchers - National Institutes of Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNbDExN1A2cktIbmJUYS1VV1lGanFRVk1YUFRKNVNRcDA4SXR3LXFBalhmVldTS2JYZG1wRVFNR1Vmb2RQWnJhbERtTUUxeVNCdEMzaVRWWFVHWkFiZ3UtT2JzcHpNR2l6Vms1djlpYUtiRjhzVDRMdzBfUFVRU19XSFRmZTBRTUZsVFBpN0tmZUttWXoteVA2ckUzRmp6OEtnbVVmd0M5eGJ2bUNpRXZhUmp1d1RKTmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div about="/news-events/news-releases/topical-steroid-withdrawal-diagnostic-criteria-defined-nih-researchers" typeof="sioc:Item foaf:Document" class="ds-1col node node--nih-news-release media-advisory featured-media-floated view-mode-full node--full node--nih-news-release--full clearfix"&gt;

Criteria may help guide treatment of dermatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have determined that dermatitis resulting from topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is distinct from eczema and is caused by an excess of an essential chemical compound in the body. Scientists from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified treatments that could be studied in clinical trials for the condition based on their potential to lower levels of the chemical compound—called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), a form of vitamin B3. The findings were published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dermatitis is characterized by inflammation, itching, or burning sensations on the skin, and can result from various conditions including TSW and &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/eczema-atopic-dermatitis"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt;. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common cause of dermatitis and affects 10 to 30% of children and 2 to 10% of adults each year in the United States. Topical steroids—specifically glucocorticoids or topical corticosteroids—have long been used as a first-line treatment for dermatitis caused by eczema because the drugs are safe, effective, easy to apply, and considered well-tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people experience dermatitis after using topical steroids for prolonged periods of time and then stopping—a condition called TSW. Diagnosing and treating this condition is difficult because TSW is not well understood. Symptoms include skin redness, burning sensations, skin heat (thermal dysregulation), itching and peeling, which can even occur on parts of the body where topical steroids were not applied. As TSW and eczema have similar symptoms, it has been difficult to distinguish the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand TSW, a team led by scientists in NIAID’s Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology evaluated a previous survey that included 1,889 adults with symptoms similar to eczema. By dividing the participants into those with self-reported TSW and those without, the researchers identified characteristics unique to TSW. The researchers then conducted a pilot study including 16 people with symptoms consistent with TSW, 10 people with eczema but no symptoms of TSW, and 11 people without skin disease. They found that people with TSW symptoms had elevated levels of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;in their blood serum and skin, while NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were within a typical range in people without TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently used cultured skin cells and a mouse model to mimic TSW conditions. They found that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was produced in response to topical steroids and caused inflammation. The models suggested that administration of a drug that blocked the formation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;—called a mitochondrial complex I blockade—would improve TSW symptoms. In a pilot study to further assess this treatment strategy, the researchers evaluated subjective responses among study participants who used the mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs metformin, berberine, or both. After three to five months of use, most participants reported improvement in TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists provisionally established criteria that can be used by health care providers to identify TSW in people. People who have stopped topical steroid treatment and meet the criteria may be diagnosed by practitioners as having TSW. The researchers suggest that patients identified as having TSW could be treated using the proposed mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this study may help practitioners identify TSW in patients and work towards developing safe and effective treatments. According to the researchers, more research is needed to determine whether all patients with TSW have an excess of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or if there are other features that define TSW. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria will help health care providers and researchers to better understand the prevalence of TSW and evaluate the effects of using topical steroids.&lt;/p&gt;

So far this year, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/21/measles-cases/"&gt;250 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, compared to 285 cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the measles outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html?utm_campaign=SPOTREPS&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Cun0COYpVOlWGsNYFof9rVNPI3BOB4uZe66ZTd8EI1NT2WH7XFwJlbbxQ80c6KpwGQg6kaI-XWKd6YL9oOiP3_i_eKg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351798716&amp;amp;utm_content=351798716&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt; to spread&lt;/a&gt; and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people vaccinated for the disease will have lifelong protection, there are some instances when another dose is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Do you need a booster?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to know if you need a measles booster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defense against measles is two doses of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine during childhood. With those, you are considered fully vaccinated for life and do not need a booster shot, even if there is an outbreak in your area. The two-dose regimen began in 1989.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may need another shot if you received the MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1968 because you may have received a “killed” measles vaccine used at the time, which is not adequate protection. The current vaccine is live, meaning it has a small, weakened dose of measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, you likely had only one shot, which the CDC recommended at the time.  A single dose is about 93% effective against measles. If you are traveling to places with high rates of measles or lower vaccination rates than the U.S., you may want to get a second shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not need a booster shot if you were born before 1957 because you likely were infected in childhood and have presumed protection against measles.  “If you got measles as a child, you don’t need to worry, because that’s the best immunity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/find-a-doctor/detail/leslie-diaz-1750342689"&gt;Dr. Leslie Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist with Palm Beach Health Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health experts recommend a booster if you work in healthcare or plan to travel to areas with outbreaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are immunocompromised or pregnant, you should not get a booster. There is a risk of the live virus crossing the placenta. However, pregnant women need to be extra cautious because contracting measles can cause congenital defects in an unborn baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Testing for measles immunity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone uncertain whether they have immunity to measles can take a blood test (also called a titer test) to measure antibodies against measles in your blood. You can get the test at most primary care offices, retail sites like &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;CVS Minute Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, or your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test is positive, you have immunity to the disease from a previous vaccination or an infection. Negative test results mean you have no immunity. Diaz says not to rely on the results entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the titer test is positive, you have some immunity, but it doesn’t quantify how much. It doesn’t say you have great or poor immunity, so if it is positive you can take some time, but you probably should still get the booster,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Anne Algie, a Lee County nurse, took the titer test earlier this week. “I will get the results and then make a decision whether I need the booster,” she said. “I will be 70 soon, and while in great health, I do have a few autoimmune diseases and a few other health issues in my history.  I want to be safe for myself and for the others in my community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Bartle, a Miami/Fort Lauderdale medical social worker, is scheduled for a measles titer test on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I received two doses of the vaccine over 30 years ago,” she said. “I’m getting a titer test to be careful. If my antibodies are okay, I won’t get a booster, if they are low I will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartle said she is nervous about the side effects of a live attenuated vaccine. “But I would rather tough it out through mild symptoms than contract what is one of the most contagious viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says getting another dose is safe, even if you already have some immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk is really close to nothing,” Diaz said. “You may feel achy for a few days or have irritation at the injection site, the same side effects as with any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do have some measles immunity, you are more likely to have a milder illness, and less likely to spread the disease to many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local county health departments can help if you have immunizations recorded in the &lt;a href="https://flshotsusers.com/"&gt;Florida SHOTS&lt;/a&gt; system, which tracks immunization records for vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can spread quickly. On average, one infected person may infect about &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/28/measles-outbreak/"&gt;15 other people&lt;/a&gt;, according to Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body. Diaz said the symptoms come on 10 to 14 days after exposure. “It starts with typical viral stuff — cough, sore throat, runny nose. Then the rash appears along with red, itchy eyes known as conjunctivitis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the vaccine, it takes about two weeks to get the full benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all need to pay attention to the outbreaks and keep close surveillance,” Diaz said. “It still can get out of hand because it’s very contagious. You will need to decide when you need a booster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,  Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Fox News this week: “I’m a freedom-of-choice person” regarding vaccines. He also said the government is providing vitamin A to the measles outbreak-impacted areas in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say children with measles are at an increased risk of vitamin A deficiency and supplementation might reduce death, adding that the better choice is to prevent measles from happening in the first place through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Included in each study were participants who were free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butter intake was considered through cooking with butter or adding butter to food during meals, and plant-based oil alternatives were olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, and safflower oil. During up to 33 years of follow-up, participants were given food intake questionnaires at baseline and every four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers observed that substituting 10 grams of butter a day with an equal amount of plant-based oil was associated with an estimated 17% reduction in overall mortality and a 17% reduction in cancer mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Butter is high in saturated fat and calories, making it a less healthy option than other dairy products like milk, cheese, or yogurt,” Chen said. “It is this saturated fat that increases someone’s risk of developing heart disease, particularly through increasing ‘bad’ cholesterol levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David Cutler, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was also not involved in the study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that not all fats are created equal — some are beneficial to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to remember that it is essential to have some fat or oil (liquid fat) in our diets. We ingest these substances as fatty acids and then transport them in our blood stream as triglycerides,” Cutler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatty acids are necessary components of many cells in our bodies, circulating chemicals and important hormones. There are also certain fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) which require fats in our diets to be absorbed. While our bodies can manufacture many of the fatty acids necessary for survival, there are two ‘essential’ fatty acids which we cannot manufacture and must be included in our diets,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing fats in their most unprocessed form — and prioritizing those with benefits to metabolism and long-term health — is the most important aspect to consider when thinking about good sources, &lt;a href="https://www.melaniemurphyrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Melanie Murphy Richter&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, a nutritionist and founder of Wholistic Ritual, who also was not involved with the study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a functional nutrition standpoint, fats are not just a source of energy but essential for cellular repair, hormone production, brain function, and inflammation regulation. Whole-food sources of fat offer the greatest benefits because they come with additional nutrients that support the body’s ability to process and utilize fats efficiently,” Richter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter provided a list of sources for good fats, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/strong&gt; – Almonds, walnuts, flax, chia, and hemp seeds provide omega-3s, fiber, and plant-based protein, which help balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocados&lt;/strong&gt; – A rich source of monounsaturated fats, potassium, and fiber that supports heart health, insulin sensitivity, and satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil&lt;/strong&gt; – High in polyphenols and monounsaturated fats, olive oil is known for its ability to combat oxidative stress and support vascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt; – Wild salmon, sardines, and mackerel provide long-chain omega-3s (EPA and DHA), which are critical for brain function, reducing inflammation, and maintaining metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grass-fed butter and ghee&lt;/strong&gt; – These contain fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K2, along with butyrate, which supports gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut and MCT oil&lt;/strong&gt; – These oils contain medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are rapidly converted into energy rather than stored as fat, making them beneficial for brain function and metabolic support when used in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; should also be part of the calculus when picking butter substitutes or healthy sources of fat. Cutler explained that omega-3 fatty acids, which include the essential alpha linolenic acid, can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, therefore, cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vegetable oils which are high in omega-3 fatty acids are flaxseed and walnut oil. Fish oil is another source of omega-3 fatty acids which tend to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease,” Cutler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-6 fatty acids, like the essential linoleic acid, are prevalent in corn and soybean oil, and these have limited conversion to EPA and DHA.” So, while research on the effects of these oils on heart health remains mixed, Cutler suggests they do not lower LDL cholesterol or reduce cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Grass-fed butter&lt;/a&gt;, which comes from cows that eat primarily grass, is seen as a much healthier version of butter. It contains more nutrients, such as the natural fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been noted for its potential positive effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and immune function. But, as with most aspects of dietary health, balance is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A small amount of butter consumed in moderation can still be part of a well-balanced diet,” Dr. Chen said. “Grass-fed butter (butter from grass-fed cows) is thought to be a healthier option than regular butter, as it contains lower levels of saturated fat and higher levels of unsaturated fat and Vitamin A.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter agreed, pointing to how butter’s effects on health depend on someone’s overall diet and their metabolic response, but noting that grass-fed is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grass-fed vs. regular butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grass-fed butter has a significantly different nutrient profile than conventional butter, providing higher levels of omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and vitamin K2, which support heart health, immune function, and metabolic balance. It also contains butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that supports gut barrier integrity and inflammation regulation. Conventional butter, typically from grain-fed cows, is lower in these nourishing nutrients and is also higher in omega-6 fatty acids, which can contribute to inflammation.”&lt;br&gt;— Melanie Murphy Richter, MS, RDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:29:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQUmp4dDQzYWZHaklsaER3N0hpVmthX2I3amJSMHp5MFBSUnA0aVpxTUZ3NWhCaGU4QTg5V2pMY1VKSnlVYUR0eGJrTzJ1NXl3RlJNOG5yOUJQNTNpbTRyUDZqeU93elgxTVVlTXAydkk0dlVvQkhrU3hKbXZSYzAzcGxWSDZEa1dKbWpoaTV0NkE1VURQRU5sLUxn</guid></item><item><title>What Minnesotans need to know about bird flu risks - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1Ra1lNWUNIT0pfUlZreTBDTlo0UkdITzRmVEE2d0QzTVk5aTVfM3ZBaGE4Z2RDbElzSFBfY2J5cVZvTFItY2luMU5RdlVwRkR1cmxRMjI5VzJXd2NIMUgwU3hqTnZGb2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The CDC says the virus remains a low public health risk for the general population.

                                Tracy Robert, a personal trainer and nutrition coach, was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40.

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;She said she wishes doctors took her "symptoms and concerns seriously." She believes if they had screened her for colon cancer sooner, they might have caught it before it reached stage 2B-3A. By the time Robert was diagnosed, she needed to have part of her large intestine removed and replaced by a colostomy bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert's story is not uncommon. More people under the age of 45 are being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;diagnosed with colon cancer.&lt;/a&gt; Doctors in the US recommend people start getting colon cancer screenings at 45. In Canada, doctors recommend that screening begin at 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms that might warrant earlier testing can be easily overlooked. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Common signs of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, such as constipation or diarrhea, can also be caused by gastrointestinal-related issues like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/what-is-celiac-disease" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/gluten-intolerance-symptoms" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gluten intolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Shannin Desroches, a 27-year-old from Ontario, Canada, who buckled in pain after every meal. She planned to get bloodwork to check for celiac disease, but her symptoms became so severe she checked into urgent care. Tests revealed multiple tumors throughout her body. At 26, she had stage 4 colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;For doctors, it's a tricky tightrope to walk when they're diagnosing young patients. About &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://gastro.org/press-releases/new-survey-finds-forty-percent-of-americans-daily-lives-are-disrupted-by-digestive-troubles/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;45% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; have digestive issues, many of which have crossover symptoms with colon cancer. Because &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.health.com/money/colonoscopy-costs" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;colonoscopies cost around $2,000&lt;/a&gt; on average, doctors typically won't urge young patients to get one without &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-had-my-first-colonoscopy-in-my-twenties-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;serious symptoms&lt;/a&gt; or a family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer rates&lt;/a&gt; continue to rise worldwide, spotting the symptoms early can make a huge difference in how patients are treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="108877b9-7c88-4ba0-9e5c-d7959e771622" data-toc-id="108877b9-7c88-4ba0-9e5c-d7959e771622"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early colon cancer symptoms can be mild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;common colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in people under 50 include abdominal pain, altered bowel movements, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea. In many cases, like Desroches', severe symptoms don't show up until later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where the tumor is, those symptoms might be very mild at first, Dr. David Richards, a gastroenterologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tumor grows in the center of the colon, it might go undetected or produce mild discomfort. "It hasn't yet gotten big enough or invaded into adjacent structures enough to start really causing symptoms," Richards told BI. On the surface, it might look like a gluten allergy or gastrointestinal issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="08b4f6d6-9f2e-4557-81de-435dc5405362" data-toc-id="08b4f6d6-9f2e-4557-81de-435dc5405362"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary changes can temporarily improve cancer symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with GI disorders are often advised to make dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches tried to offset her symptoms by eating smaller snacks, but her stools remained thin and she had constant pain in her abdomen. Robert, who was diagnosed with IBS at 20, remembers being told to "eat more fiber."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, diet tweaks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;can temporarily reduce symptoms of colon cancer, creating "a false-positive response to diet change," Dr. Mohammed Najeeb Al Hallak, an oncologist specializing in GI malignancies at the Karmanos Cancer Institute, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, following a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/gluten-free-diet" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gluten-free diet&lt;/a&gt; to treat celiac&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;disease can make stools firmer by reducing inflammation in the small intestine. Less inflammation can also lessen colon cancer symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person has colon cancer, he said these positive changes are temporary — and may&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;delay the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="69e0dc9c-601e-4b88-98c6-19ebaa937e5f" data-toc-id="69e0dc9c-601e-4b88-98c6-19ebaa937e5f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to spot the difference between colon cancer and digestive issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical community is still debating the best age to start annual screenings. Based on rising colon cancer rates, US screening guidelines were changed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/when-to-get-first-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;from age 50 to 45&lt;/a&gt;. "Some people argued about lowering it even more because we've been seeing colon cancer popping up more often in younger populations," Richards said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're under 45, there are some "alarm symptoms" to look out for. Anemia, bright red or black stools, unexplained weight loss, trouble swallowing, and fever are all signs to take your symptoms more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Hallak said to always get a second opinion if you feel dismissed by your doctor. For example, celiac&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;disease requires a biopsy and blood tests to confirm the diagnosis — never accept "it's probably celiac" without those tests. See someone who takes your pain seriously, especially if the symptoms don't improve.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a surprise.

This can leave people extremely susceptible to other pathogens for weeks after an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The virus also attacks the immune system’s memory cells. These cells remember and recognize the pathogens you’ve encountered over the course of your life and protect against them, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has studied measles and immunity. Scientists call the phenomenon “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Everyone who gets sick from measles will experience some level of immune amnesia, Dr. Mina said. This happens on a spectrum. For some people, it might mean that coming down with the flu will keep them in bed for an extra day or two, he said. But others may lose far more immunity and wind up getting seriously sick from the viruses they encounter. This immune amnesia can last for around three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A real concern is you’re not just going to get measles and get sick, but within the next couple of years, your kid’s going to be really vulnerable to a lot of other stuff,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can also cause severe, long-term complications. About one in 1,000 children who develop measles will experience brain swelling, which can cause hearing and vision loss, intellectual disabilities and permanent brain damage. And people of any age &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/well/immunocompromised-disease.html" title=""&gt;who are immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt; are at greater risk for developing a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/114/5/e657/67706/A-New-Complication-of-Stem-Cell-Transplantation?redirectedFrom=PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specific type of brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; that can occur for up to a year after they recover, said Dr. Milstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, the newly minted health and human services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The families that I touch base with in Gaines County — they are fearful and concerned,” said Dr. Montanez, who practices at Texas Tech University Health Science Center.

&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles has been spreading&lt;/a&gt; across America, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 220 cases nationwide as of March 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The uptick in cases began with an outbreak in Texas, where there have been 223 cases identified since late January (as of March 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new case was confirmed in a Howard County, Maryland, resident last week after the individual traveled internationally through Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-measles-outbreak-see-states-where-cases-have-been-reported" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. MEASLES OUTBREAK: SEE THE STATES WHERE CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials claimed that this case is not related to the Texas outbreak, warning travelers to be on the lookout for measles symptoms if they &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveled through the airport&lt;/a&gt; around that same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and is most threatening to unvaccinated individuals, Fox News' senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel previously told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WedMD CMO Dr. John Whyte (not pictured) recommended that travelers wear masks, wash their hands and stay aware of their surroundings amid measles outbreaks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a 90% chance you will get it if you are unvaccinated and step into a room where someone with measles was two hours before," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/maryland-confirms-first-measles-case-traveler-major-dc-airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARYLAND CONFIRMS FIRST MEASLES CASE IN TRAVELER AT MAJOR DC AIRPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traveling in a confined space, such as an airplane, exposure becomes even more of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital in New York City, Dr. John Whyte, WebMD chief medical officer and practicing physician, emphasized how measles is "one of the most contagious &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;respiratory viruses&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of this article.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"The good news is, if you're immunized, you're unlikely to be affected."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is much more contagious than COVID," he said. "It’s a factor of several times more contagious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One infected person can impact about 10 to 15 other people, according to Whyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to protect yourself &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from infection&lt;/a&gt; while traveling and flying, the doctor said, including being aware of your surroundings and wearing a mask in areas where cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When traveling in a confined space, such as an airplane, exposure becomes even more of a concern.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor also recommended "good handwashing" after touching surfaces, as well as keeping surfaces clean, since &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virus droplets&lt;/a&gt; can stick and spread when contact is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have been infected with measles often do not become symptomatic until four days after exposure, Whyte shared, so it may be difficult to track the origin of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/florida-alerts-first-measles-case-public-school-experts-stress-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA ALERTS FIRST MEASLES CASE OF YEAR IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AS EXPERTS STRESS VACCINATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte mentioned that the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is "very effective," although some people have chosen not to be vaccinated, which is "where we’re seeing those cases," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the MMR vaccine is most commonly administered to children, some adults might not remember if they received it and may be concerned about the strength of their immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A booster for the MMR vaccine is available for people who lack immunity, Whyte noted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte suggested receiving a measles titer, which is a blood test that measures antibody (immunity) levels against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for people who are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/travel-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveling to other countries&lt;/a&gt;, where exposure risk may be higher, the doctor added. For those lacking immunity, MMR vaccine boosters are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd say if you're starting to see measles in your area, and you're concerned about whether or not you have immunity, go to your doctor and get your titers checked," he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Otherwise, practice all those good hygiene methods that we talked about. Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Be aware of your surroundings. Clean surfaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles cases are mostly occurring in unvaccinated, school-aged children, the data shows.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are feeling sick, Whyte encouraged staying home and abstaining from traveling to help &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;keep others healthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically begin with coughing and sneezing, and then lead to a red rash on the face and body several days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of physicians [have] never seen measles," Whyte noted. "So, you have to sometimes prompt your doctor if you think you might have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious complications, the doctor warned, including brain swelling and pneumonia, particularly in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;older individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is, if you're immunized, you're unlikely to be affected, even if you come into contact with someone who does have measles," Whyte said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the whole beauty of immunization."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNdU81a2UybWpiSGI2Y28wVDNhNlllUDZYYmp2NGdRb1hnLVlVN3R0RFNLbDhMRkE0SFJnX2VwdEdTSi1TakVoQ3ZyaUNmNHpLcnVZN3ZGZ2xfeU81Tm5OQnZQQTRYeVVSWWxKS3hHS3NyYWVLeHVEa3RnMVJGV2dlS2FuTW5tQ03SAYwBQVVfeXFMTm1NNnRRazVfNkZ6NTh4MDA0TVJpei1ibGZfd0FqVnJrcUZ4V1FoTkIwTTd2QlBhaTF2aVFiRW9mN0NvemFtdGRUMTQtejZKYkQ5cU4xbGlCVDlxclh6UTNrT3hZRGM2Q3JSZjZGd1gzclo4SGxZZjd3Y1NFUUR6dGd5aFBkZmJOWkJ6cDM</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. says measles vaccine routinely causes deaths.

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-jr-confirmed-hhs-secretary-vote-vaccine-critic-to-top-trump-health-official/"&gt;was confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as America’s secretary of health and human services, neutral observers might have asked themselves: Would it be possible for a lawyer who had questioned the safety of childhood vaccinations for two decades to look at the available data and reconsider his views?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s recent interviews with Fox News, along with an op-ed he published on that outlet’s website, have been enough to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;make many experts conclude the answer is “no.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parsing every claim about the measles vaccine that Kennedy has made would take a long time, so let’s focus on one: that the vaccine causes deaths every year. Researchers say that simply isn’t true, except potentially in a small number of people who are not supposed to receive it — those with compromised immune systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There are adverse events from the vaccine,” Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;March 11 interview &lt;/a&gt;with Fox’s Sean Hannity. “It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Infectious Disease Society of America says&lt;/a&gt; there have been “no deaths related to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in healthy individuals.” (Since the 1970s, the measles vaccine has been given in a combination shot with mumps and rubella to minimize the number of injections kids get.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine has never been found to cause a death in an immunocompetent individual,” Daniel Griffin, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Island Infectious Disease Medical in New York said, echoing that conclusion. “If you’ve got someone who has a compromised immune system, and someone doesn’t know any better and gives them an active vaccine, which is what you are not supposed to do, then, you know, that could result in a death.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is itself a killer. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, it was a near-certainty that children would be infected before the age of 15 — about three or four million cases occurred every year. Most children had no complications, but a little more than 1 in 1,000 would die after developing pneumonia or encephalitis. That equates to 400 or 500 deaths a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00850-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; 2024 study in the The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;estimated that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;measles vaccines prevented 93.7 million deaths globally between 1974 and 2024 — a number equivalent to a quarter of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles isn’t a huge threat now. Public health experts worry that won’t remain the case because of low vaccination rates. Importantly, even though the measles vaccine is one of the most effective on the market, it will not protect every person vaccinated. Perhaps one person in 20, maybe less, will not have fully protective antibody levels. Having more unvaccinated people means more risk for everyone, including people with compromised immune systems and children too young to receive the shot. (Children are eligible for the shot at 1 year of age.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All medical products come with risks. The measles vaccine includes a weakened virus, which means that scientists developed it by passing a measles virus through cell cultures and chicken embryos until it became less able to cause serious symptoms in people, but still able to spur immunity. It is, essentially, measles with dramatically less risk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shot still commonly causes a fever. Seizures caused by fever occur in 3 in 10,000 people who receive the shot. Clotting issues occur in roughly 3 in 100,000. Allergic reactions occur in perhaps 3 in a million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; are even rarer than that. As Kennedy noted, the vaccine can cause encephalitis, although case counts appear vanishingly rare. There are also scattered case reports of patients developing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3589229/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20optic%20neuritis%20is,to%20non%2Dviral%20vaccine%20components." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that can cause blindness, but in most of these patients sight returned with time or treatment. Those cases are so rare it is difficult to even estimate the risk of them occurring — except to say that it is very, very low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy’s assertion that the vaccine causes deaths every year likely comes from reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a government-run database that allows individuals or their doctors to submit reports of bad outcomes they think were caused by a vaccine. It is an important early warning system for vaccine side effects, but a flawed one, because there is no way of controlling for the fact that people sometimes think a bad outcome may have been caused by a vaccine when it was not. When there is press coverage of vaccines, reports of side effects tend to go up even though the number of children receiving the vaccines do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236284/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20favors%20acceptance%20of,in%20temporal%20relation%20to%20vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In the mid-1990s,&lt;/a&gt; the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — did a careful review of reports from VAERS. They concluded that except for allergic reactions and blood clot disorders, which were incredibly rare, there was no link between the MMR and deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy’s claim about vaccine deaths came amid a series of other claims about vaccine safety. In one interview, he claimed vaccines are rarely compared with placebos; they usually are. He also made it sound as if measles immunity from the vaccine wanes faster than it does; in fact it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20&amp;amp;%20MMRV%20vaccines%20usually%20protect,common%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;typically lifelong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If, as Kennedy acknowledged, everyone will either get the vaccine or measles, it would seem advisable to get the vaccine, which clearly results in few if any deaths, instead of measles itself, which we know is capable of causing hundreds of deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People should be able to make their own decisions about their children’s vaccinations. But, as Kennedy says, they should have accurate scientific information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

In the August poll, 28% said they thought COVID vaccines had caused thousands of deaths. In June 2021, that number was 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Christopher Whaley, a health economist at Brown University, to help clarify how we should view the effectiveness of the shots and the estimated number of lives they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s really hard to think that President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is anything but that largest public health success in history,” Whaley said. “I think we sometimes lose appreciation for how important and how impactful getting access to vaccines was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whaley has published two studies on the number of lives saved by the COVID vaccines; one of them looked at the impact that the vaccine rollout in December 2020 had on the rate of deaths being recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the United States, we found that COVID vaccines averted nearly 140,000 deaths than would have otherwise happened [over the six months studied] if vaccines were not rolled out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Calculating &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00220-5/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excess mortality figures;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;excess mortality figures&lt;/a&gt;, or the increase in the number of deaths over a given time period versus a comparable period, Whaley then included factors such as the age of a state’s population and how individual states went about distributing the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Alaska, for example, was the first state to reach 20 COVID vaccine doses per 100 adults,’ he said. “Alabama was almost a month later to reach that same threshold in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While studies like Whaley’s are estimates, and figures can vary depending on the data set used by researchers, he stressed that the basic approach is scientifically sound and used to calculate outcomes for a variety of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s not just COVID vaccines or vaccines in general that we use these types of approaches. As researchers we use them across the board in many aspects of health care,” he said. “The same approach is used to look at what are the health effects of Medicaid expansion and getting access to Medicaid coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By Whaley’s calculation, COVID vaccines saved 2.4 million lives in 141 countries, when the threat of death from the virus was at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know that prior to vaccines, COVID was rampant and was leading to many, many deaths,” he said. “Without vaccines, it’s hard to think about a world in which there would have been such an immediate improvement in health and reductions in mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQdGxRd2RtLVBoU1R6elBrZExiZHlzQ2VHN19xUHAyZnVzMGhySGhNdUItczZNV2pTd3lZUzN5OFNJM0hVbTVHS1ZoLTZNV1hfZ0g3a3dpR1dlcnZwNUxOZjRta1VPY2ZMemNjeHFRcXN1dFNTTVFuMnprbFYzaWdRaFRlSGxMRkE0c0IwTnBSRmRhWjJLc01iN3hoSXlUQkhRc2J2eHlGVEQ4TzRZdU5acVZYSQ</guid></item><item><title>Pancreatic cancer skin symptoms of disease that 'usually gets spotted too late' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxObmh2bEw4YzBNNHNxMk9ISW12NWd5Y2kxMlNQUkpROERuZl9VcWQ5bnB6MXlwc3U1aWFfUlllbUUweFV0M2lTTmNfc0hPbU1FeGFuSTJiNmVpOEJ4MmljOVpRYkZpeTRGODBuTGF5ZGIyMXFncDVJNW1UOFpmeERUdjZPYmFoaFlReDlxU3d1aUZNZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxOX1ZxY1FSS2FESk00dkp3M3EzRlRUYkhCcVBweFpwY2ZHUlJHSk1EMl9COWszaWpQdGpMdzY1RXFsLUY1cWs1eHJfT3JVUVpoT2J1dEJyYVg3eFQ3UlNXVjdmNFZNcjZ6OUpXZ1liN3EzUk51bzZ5QjZqNW5oOERhSmw5dURQdi1rVTY3dUZwSzNTNmlmRGRJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts have highlighted seven key symptoms of a disease with an alarmingly low survival rate, dubbed as "scary bad" by a top medical university. Despite progress in treatments for various cancers, pancreatic cancer continues to pose a significant challenge, with the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; admitting that it "can be difficult to treat". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early detection is crucial, but the issue with pancreatic cancer is its elusive nature, leading to a survival rate of merely 25% of patients living beyond a year, and a scant 5% surviving 10 or more years post-diagnosis. Cancer Research UK attributes the grim prognosis for pancreatic cancer largely to late diagnosis, with the cancer often being quite advanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only about 10% of patients qualify for surgery to remove the cancer, which provides the best hope for a cure. The pancreas, a small organ nestled behind the stomach and before the spine, plays a critical role in digesting food in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though relatively uncommon, pancreatic cancer ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, trailing lung, colon, and breast cancer. The Medical University of South Carolina has stressed the importance of recognising the seven primary symptoms of pancreatic cancer, which include:.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; People are being warned that jaundice - the yellowing of the skin and eyes - along with light-coloured stools and dark urine, could be symptoms of pancreatic cancer. Other signs to look out for include abdominal or back pain, fatigue, weight loss, and a lack of appetite, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/seven-symptoms-pancreatic-cancer-rarely-30257306" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, apart from the first three symptoms, the others "are not specific indicators that something is wrong and even these are often late signs of disease," according to MUSC Health. "The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is difficult and often late. The symptoms are not terribly specific and this is why the diagnosis is often at an advanced stage."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is hope surrounding a new blood marker (GPC1) that could assist in early detection, but a definitive diagnosis usually requires radiologic studies or a tissue biopsy. People can also take steps to lower their risk of developing pancreatic cancer by leading a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes limiting alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week, giving up smoking, reducing intake of processed or red meats, and maintaining a healthy weight, as recommended by NHS guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxObmh2bEw4YzBNNHNxMk9ISW12NWd5Y2kxMlNQUkpROERuZl9VcWQ5bnB6MXlwc3U1aWFfUlllbUUweFV0M2lTTmNfc0hPbU1FeGFuSTJiNmVpOEJ4MmljOVpRYkZpeTRGODBuTGF5ZGIyMXFncDVJNW1UOFpmeERUdjZPYmFoaFlReDlxU3d1aUZNZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxOX1ZxY1FSS2FESk00dkp3M3EzRlRUYkhCcVBweFpwY2ZHUlJHSk1EMl9COWszaWpQdGpMdzY1RXFsLUY1cWs1eHJfT3JVUVpoT2J1dEJyYVg3eFQ3UlNXVjdmNFZNcjZ6OUpXZ1liN3EzUk51bzZ5QjZqNW5oOERhSmw5dURQdi1rVTY3dUZwSzNTNmlmRGRJ</guid></item><item><title>Measles Is Back Across the U.S. What to Know About the Deadly Virus. - Barron's</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE4wUW45M2JSMDIxbUlWYlY3cjFXeDFOYzNUX21UYkRnS0dIRV9fRFFFM0s3QU8yZUVMZWNYM0l6eWZqME0tYk50c0JKalhhWk5CNEhOWDIyckhPdTh0a21IMHhTQlEySHBuMnJnQ0hza1pmcEo4MmRDNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Barron's</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE4wUW45M2JSMDIxbUlWYlY3cjFXeDFOYzNUX21UYkRnS0dIRV9fRFFFM0s3QU8yZUVMZWNYM0l6eWZqME0tYk50c0JKalhhWk5CNEhOWDIyckhPdTh0a21IMHhTQlEySHBuMnJnQ0hza1pmcEo4MmRDNQ</guid></item><item><title>Lamar County in Texas reports 4 confirmed measles cases - The Dallas Morning News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa0xRUXNkMjVTNldFZmViUVR0dVhTTzJUSWpCeHJuU3dQY1RJRTB6SC1oazNMZWhNWFpLOVd5YWIwa1ZxeWtEM3MyVEFFR2RiY1pPQzIwTmFadWZlOTF0NDJpLTNaSGNYUDJqM0JxMjNuazFQSHNFeE1BYU83UUJ6R2VqLUI4eUJ0T1lEQnMxbkRIbmxBbHFCYmtzUFFHTTdkSXhKREh3b0d4UmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In what could become a spiraling health crisis for &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/13/live-track-measles-cases-during-west-texas-outbreak-with-these-graphics/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/13/live-track-measles-cases-during-west-texas-outbreak-with-these-graphics/"&gt;the state&lt;/a&gt;, public health officials in Lamar County on Thursday announced four confirmed cases of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Paris-Lamar County Health District officials said the extremely &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/"&gt;contagious virus&lt;/a&gt; had been diagnosed in four patients who range in age from 5 months to adulthood.

Even though this is only a short 10-minute workout, I found it easier to concentrate when I went back to my desk and things that I’d been putting off on my to-do list felt more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF) is released when walking and this stimulates the growth of new brain cells, which &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-boosted-my-immune-system-3"&gt;It boosted my immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that walking at a brisk pace can boost the number of white blood cells (the body’s natural defense against infection). So if you are looking for a way to improve your immunity, this indoor workout is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I credit regular exercise for keeping me healthy, and it’s rare that I succumb to a cold, or if I do it’s not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-was-the-active-recovery-session-i-needed-3"&gt;It was the active recovery session I needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After moving from using 8kg to 10kg weights in my strength sessions, this workout served as a great bit of active recovery to help ease my achy muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can ease joint pain by producing synovial fluid to lubricate the joints, and I felt like a lot of the post-workout stiffness and soreness had dissipated by the end of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;

(WSAZ) - The West Virginia Bureau of Public Health believes some West Virginians may have been exposed to measles after a Maryland resident, infected with the illness, landed at the Washington Dulles International Airport on Mar. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say the site of the possible exposure site is in terminal A of the airport, happening on transportation to the main terminal and the baggage claim area between 4-9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Department of Health officials also say if you were in that area or think you may have been exposed, it’s best to watch for symptoms until Mar. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Department of Health said the first stage of symptoms often result in a fever greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, cough and watery red eyes. Officials said these symptoms can show up seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;After symptoms start, officials said three to five days after that, a rash could appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. “People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared,” according to a release from the Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Kanawha County Health Officer, Dr. Steven Eshenaur, said measles spreading to several states bordering West Virginia shows just how infectious the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“A room with 10 people, nine out of 10 would likely contract the disease because it is spread so easily through the air. Even after a person leaves a room, measles can be spread for hours potentially later, just from it lingering in the air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Eshenaur said West Virginia has some of the highest immunization rates in the country, and it’s the only way to prevent an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So, it’s really important not to buy into unscientific data that says that you could treat this disease with vitamin A, when in fact, it does not work for the treatment or prevention of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;He said a change to the current requirement for vaccines would make cases here more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If we do relax our immunization laws, our population will likely become susceptible to measles outbreaks as we have seen in the other states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Eshenaur said children and pregnant women are at risk of the worst effects when catching measles without protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Measles can cause irreparable damage to an unborn child, so it’s really important that women be protected from contracting measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Eshenaur says the disease is a little too close for comfort and using remedies including cod liver oil, vitamin A and diet changes will not cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WSAZ.

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881yx2w003y2cp41t2h77i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the composition of influenza shots for the upcoming respiratory virus season, but without input from its independent vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00063b6monos4s2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee had been scheduled to meet Thursday to weigh in on the composition of the flu shots, but that session was canceled without explanation in late February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00073b6mj73lth1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, experts from within the FDA, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Defense gathered Thursday to go over surveillance data from the US and around the world about flu viruses that are currently circulating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00083b6mjal37mb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA is recommending that flu vaccines for the 2025-26 season be trivalent, protecting against two strains of influenza A and one of influenza B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00093b6mcrxmcgyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA anticipates that there will be an adequate and diverse supply of approved trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines” for the upcoming virus season, it said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000a3b6mdsc6i1j5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several ways to make flu vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the most common&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs, a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000b3b6mja09sjj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure manufacturers can deliver the shots to doctors’ offices and pharmacies in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000c3b6mku1p5ew8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000d3b6mnket2kvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system/who-collaboration-center-erl" target="_blank"&gt;a network of&lt;/a&gt; seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and the FDA are members.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000e3b6mt6ly34md@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. WHO’s own &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for 2025-26 generally parallel those of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000f3b6ml2uqttjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet next and publicly discuss the recommendation and make its own endorsement, and then the agency would make its final decision.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000g3b6muwjlnz5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cancellation of the committee meeting had prompted concerns about the timing of and access to flu shots for this fall. “I’m glad that they’ve come out with the influenza recommendation in a timely manner,” Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the independent advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital, said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zgti000k3b6mu991g95z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 2024-25 flu season – the worst in the US in more than a decade – is believed to have peaked in early February. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-09.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; in early March that there had been at least 40 million illnesses, 520,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths caused by flu this season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881yyph00003b6m0vt715ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

"Large doses can be harmful to small children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The researchers concluded that the consumption of slush ice drinks containing glycerol may cause a syndrome called glycerol intoxication.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of sudden illness after consuming a slush drink had never been reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medical literature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;medical literature&lt;/a&gt;, Crushell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are small and include only the sickest children who were brought to emergency departments and who were referred on to specialists in inherited metabolic disorders," Crushell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were referred because their symptoms were similar to those of some rare metabolic diseases.

"Parents and guardians should check the ingredients of syrups used to make slush ices in the home for the presence of glycerol and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope this new study could lead to the development of new policies and guidance related to glycerol ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and to a leading manufacturer of slush drinks requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/popular-frozen-drink-linked-childrens-illness-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Popular frozen drink linked to children’s illness, study finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Popular frozen drink linked to children’s illness, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:35:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1Oa1FnOGRHMWNQeUtWYlNNbVBCZGxULVhyWlVLZXR2eEszaDI0RXZrVWprUUx6b0Z1eGMxV0VwdnoyOGNYSERCV3NzMHpnVjBVd1pYTWQ5RUtienE4WnJWU3BVZ2xnNkRuZ2ltbXJ2S2lBWnlCSFVGcGhuOA</guid></item><item><title>USAID kept Kajol alive – but after the cuts she's struggling - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBWNnVLZXF4NUtHMkQ5WUFlc3JnYUJBN0xQU2FUenR0bU9mdFBqUzAtX2lKcHdFYmRYQ1BKcjE2T1hGQjI3cEJFemxGcG5EMWoyVl9IZXRwbEpvd9IBX0FVX3lxTE11R0lwNmp1SElEX1BDQk9KTHZFYXp0RWtTOEhSV2J1WGRudWplVlhYTE1aSElKRDA0M2VVQ0V2Q1VENk1WbmVIeFFKczJCT0dvT3Rhb2p5TEdZR2JMMl84?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;USAID kept them alive - then Trump's cuts came&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Samira Hussain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC South Asia Correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6842/live/30fecb90-0000-11f0-a097-d55f24e930f5.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A girl wearing a headscarf looks at the camera" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Kajol, who is the sole breadwinner in her family, contracted tuberculosis in January&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx2401vn5ro" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;TB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We are poor people," she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now I have to go get the medicine myself," she says. "I am struggling a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The people here are quite vulnerable," says Dipa, 21. "I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Reports show thousands of cases of TB in Bangladesh have been cured thanks to USAID support &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control," said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia," says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. "In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least," says Mr Saleh. "It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of refugees at Cox's Bazar will be left with just enough to live and not much more&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Interim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts – but doesn't say how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: "It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Asif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Unable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have run out of soap," says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. "We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rehana Begum says she believes many people will die of hunger because of cuts in aid from countries including the US&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Patients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me," she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Inside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She looked shocked. Then she started to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. "Even now, it is difficult to manage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of "a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is an absolute disaster in the making," says Rana Flowers of Unicef. "Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns.

It can result in serious health complications that, while rare, include respiratory failure, encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a rash that look like red spots or blotchy patches, which starts on the face and spreads down the body, arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While measles is often associated with a rash, it takes time for this to&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html" target="_blank"&gt; appear &lt;/a&gt;(usually about three to seven days after symptoms begin). This means the virus can often be mistaken for a cold or the flu. The rash typically lasts about four to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Individuals with measles are considered to be &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles/health-professionals-measles.html" target="_blank"&gt;infectious&lt;/a&gt; from four days before the onset of a rash until four days after its appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Most individuals recover from measles within two or three weeks. It is considered to be a vaccine-preventable disease. The first measles vaccine was licensed in Canada in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The virus is spread by air and through contact with respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth, such as when an infected person breathes, coughs, speaks or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Health Canada says it can persist on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the space.

A second dose is usually given before a child starts school (between ages 4 and 6). However, the minimum interval between doses is only four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-19" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-19" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;If I am an adult, should I consider getting a booster of the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-19" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Adults born after 1970 who live in or will be travelling to a place where measles is circulating may want to consider getting a booster if they’ve only had one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Public-health experts suggest adults should check vaccination records to determine if they’ve had one shot or two. A widespread immunization program for infants was introduced in 1983, when a single dose was given to children at one year of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A second dose was added to the program in 1996, and a large catch-up campaign was launched to give the second shot to all school-aged children, says Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;What should I do if my child is too young to be vaccinated against the measles or has only had one dose?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The answer depends on how widely measles is spreading in your area, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;In Southwestern Ontario, the epicentre of the province’s outbreak, public-health officials have set up special clinics that offer the measles shot to babies between six months and 11 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;They also encourage children who have only had one dose to get a second one as soon as possible, as long as at least four weeks have elapsed since their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Ninh Tran, the Medical Officer of Health for the Southwestern Public Health Unit, said he is recommending children in his region not wait for their second dose because of how quickly measles is spreading in his community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The same advice wouldn’t necessarily apply in parts of Canada with no measles cases, although there is no harm in receiving the two doses closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;What should I do if my child is under the age of 1?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Health professionals say some protection is offered to young babies because of an antibody transfer that takes places during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Typically, children receive a dose of the MMR vaccine at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;12 to 15 months of age, but in some instances, such as during an outbreak, health officials may suggest a dose prior to their first birthday. Babies who receive a shot before they turn 1 would still need two more shots to be fully protected against the measles, Dr. Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:06:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOTU5HWGxkaEIxVXh6b3VHMWhHZmY5Q1ZjYXFES0pIYk5mTGNNQ3pRTUpLem1WVTBJUngxWHhxdDgtQzA0MHc5R1pKMnZyT040LUk1dHpIRmRKRC1uY1ZOcnNMcnJaSjZwWVpDUmFYb3NnbFdOOTRlSnp1UVYybng2TTBrLXdCRzA</guid></item><item><title>European region sees highest number of measles cases in 25 years, WHO says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQQ0tnTkpTeXB3REs3cVZiTUVzdmtBX2hwYk9wY1l3aUdfSlBNdm44djQwbkdIQU85anUtbzRXMHlJUTVBZUhwRFR6MXBlS1drMUVXTGUxOEM3QkZnSGM2eHJ5RWdvV1lyTHpIMlVDalV0Rl9NY0VpZXNpdjM4d3djT0dOZmFPUdIBfEFVX3lxTFAtZzZHSXdrc0RUclc0RmJtbjBhUzI1YnUtUmowdFZOakVxS2Z6ZTJ4WjlNTzd2dWJ2T2E1VGJwRmJXXzRFQmI1SEgzSnc4eEpQZy1pQ1FEaWEyT1VXTXRMZWVPZEVvRmJkNmJJYzhmckNCS0pZRnhUb19nZ1k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87z9bce002f26qh3xfg4jsk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases in the European region surged last year to reach their highest levels since 1997, the World Health Organization and the UN’s children agency, UNICEF, said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200063b6m2hf8ixd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope" target="_blank"&gt;An analysis&lt;/a&gt; by WHO and UNICEF found the number of measles cases reported in European region reached 127,352 in 2024, double the reported number from the previous year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200073b6mrvmjjfr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children younger than 5 accounted for 40% of those who contracted &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/health/measles-comeback-who-cdc/index.html"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;in the region, it said, adding that half a million children missed their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200083b6m1xxohz01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles is back, and it’s a wake-up call. Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security,” Dr. Hans P. Kluge, WHO’s regional director for Europe, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200093b6mm7u0eyhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise comes after a “backsliding in immunization coverage during the pandemic,” the report said. Vaccination rates in numerous countries have yet to return to pre-Covid levels, increasing the risk of further outbreaks, it warned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000a3b6mebngycm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The European region accounted for a third of all measles cases globally in 2024, the report said. &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/eca/reports/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years" target="_blank"&gt;Immunization coverage&lt;/a&gt; for most of the region, it added, has fallen “below the recommended level for herd immunity, which is a vaccination rate of 95 per cent or higher.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000b3b6mkdtzlsms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The situation is acute in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania where, the report says, less than 80% of eligible children were vaccinated against measles in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000c3b6mca9fq503@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It stresses vaccination remains the “best line of defense against the virus,” saying that a vaccinated person exposed to measles has at least a 97% percent chance of not contracting it.

            Measles cases in the European region surged last year to reach their highest levels since 1997, the World Health Organization and the UN’s children agency, UNICEF, said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200063b6m2hf8ixd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope" target="_blank"&gt;An analysis&lt;/a&gt; by WHO and UNICEF found the number of measles cases reported in European region reached 127,352 in 2024, double the reported number from the previous year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200073b6mrvmjjfr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children younger than 5 accounted for 40% of those who contracted &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/health/measles-comeback-who-cdc/index.html"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;in the region, it said, adding that half a million children missed their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200083b6m1xxohz01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles is back, and it’s a wake-up call. Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security,” Dr. Hans P. Kluge, WHO’s regional director for Europe, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb200093b6mm7u0eyhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise comes after a “backsliding in immunization coverage during the pandemic,” the report said. Vaccination rates in numerous countries have yet to return to pre-Covid levels, increasing the risk of further outbreaks, it warned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000a3b6mebngycm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The European region accounted for a third of all measles cases globally in 2024, the report said. &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/eca/reports/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years" target="_blank"&gt;Immunization coverage&lt;/a&gt; for most of the region, it added, has fallen “below the recommended level for herd immunity, which is a vaccination rate of 95 per cent or higher.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000b3b6mkdtzlsms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The situation is acute in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania where, the report says, less than 80% of eligible children were vaccinated against measles in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87zamb2000c3b6mca9fq503@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It stresses vaccination remains the “best line of defense against the virus,” saying that a vaccinated person exposed to measles has at least a 97% percent chance of not contracting it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The researchers looked at data from more than 86,000 adults and identified four types of exercisers: those who were more active in the morning; those in the evening; midday movers; and those who were continually active all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Dr Michael Leitzmann, who led the research, said: “Our study highlights that not only is physical activity important for reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, but the timing of peak activity throughout the day could play a crucial role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This study is not the only one to point to a particular time of day to exercise, each with its own benefits. “Exercise is the best medicine, whenever you do it,” says Damian Bailey, a professor of physiology and biochemistry and director of the Neurovascular Research Laboratory at the University of South Wales. “However, you can fine-tune the body’s metabolic responses to it depending on what time you exercise and what your health goals are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;For weight loss and concentration, exercise in the morning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Morning movement has several health benefits. “Exercise in the morning is the best for losing belly fat and good for the obese and those with high blood pressure and diabetes,” Bailey says. For example, a study from Skidmore College in New York found that women who exercised in the morning lost about 10 per cent of fat around their middle, compared with 3 per cent if they worked out in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another study in 2023 from Franklin Pierce University and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University studied 5,285 adults, who were divided into groups of morning, midday and evening exercisers. Those who were active between 7am and 9am had the lowest body mass indexes and smaller waists than those who exercised later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-avoid-getting-injured-exercise-2tj7ts5wf" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 10 exercise mistakes we all make and how to avoid them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Similarly, a 2018 study published in the International Journal of Obesity put 2,680 adults on a weekly exercise plan and found those who exercised in the morning made healthier food choices throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“With morning exercise your body starts burning energy earlier in the day,” says Matt Roberts, a personal trainer who has worked with David Cameron and the designer Tom Ford. “There is some evidence that exercising in the morning is best because it raises your metabolism early and lasts for longer in your waking day, producing greater overall energy usage. And as the 2018 study shows, a morning workout puts you in the mindset of choosing healthier food during the day, so you don’t ruin all your hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Weight loss aside, morning movement has also been shown to have cognitive benefits. A 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercisers displayed better concentration and decision-making skills. “Morning workouts also have the edge because you’re less likely to put off exercising as your day gets busier and your motivation wanes,” Roberts says. “If you do your exercise in the morning, you’re done for the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.11"&gt;&lt;div id="c24b79a7-8aad-4dda-9564-11c0c305d17e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Gentle exercise after a light meal helps to “reset” your metabolism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;If you want to manage your blood sugar and reduce stress, work out at lunchtime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you don’t have time for any exercise during a busy working day, just make sure you take a short walk after your lunch. A 2022 study published in the health journal Sports Medicine found that walking between two to five minutes after eating can help lower blood sugar levels and keep insulin levels steady. If you can’t manage that, the researchers found that even standing for a short time after a meal helps. “The study found that even a short walk around the block or up the stairs after a meal can improve your digestion and blood sugar levels,” says the personal trainer Lee Mullins, founder of Workshop Gymnasium. “If you do it at lunchtime, you’ll also notice you’re less likely to have a post-lunch slump.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bailey agrees: “Gentle exercise after a light meal helps ‘reset’ your metabolism and counters the elevation in glucose, which can cause vascular complications, such as postprandial hyperglycaemia [also known as PPG, it’s a metabolic disorder where blood glucose levels are abnormally high after eating and can contribute to type 2 diabetes and heart disease].” However, keep it light. “Exercise straight after a heavy meal can cause digestive discomfort and decrease your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, so go gentle to optimise the benefits,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/health-guide-getting-fit-fat-science-g88g8wwwg" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to lose 6lb in 8 weeks: the science of getting fit fast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Exercising at lunchtime may also help your sleep. A study published in The Journal of Physiology found that exercising between 1pm and 4pm can shift your body clock forward, which makes you sleepier at bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Finally, a prelunch workout may also reap benefits. A study from Warwick University found that exercising at midday improved calmness by almost 30 per cent, with the study participants saying they felt more able to handle stress in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;If you want to boost your heart health, exercise in the evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise later on, between 4pm and 8pm, is best for high-intensity performance, and Olympic swimming records tend to be broken at 5.12pm exactly,” Bailey says. Research shows that athletes perform best in the afternoon because core body temperature tends to be at its highest between 2pm and 6pm, and exercising during this time leads to a better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So what about the rest of us? “Low to moderate intensity just before you sleep helps you sleep longer and deeper,” Bailey says. “However, high-intensity workouts will keep you awake, but if you enjoy high-intensity workouts then squeezing one in at least two hours before bed will be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study published in the journal Experimental Physiology also found that evening workouts don’t disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The impact of exercising at night varies person to person and it’s really a matter of understanding how you react,” Roberts says. “For many, moderate cardio work about an hour or two before bed allows the body to be more tired and to sleep better. But high-intensity activity may stimulate you more, so it’s worth tracking your responses because there is no need to focus on low-intensity exercises like yoga alone if you enjoy other exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Men in particular may benefit from an evening workout. Dr Paul Arciero, a professor at the Health and Human Physiological Sciences Department at Skidmore College, studied 56 men and women aged between 25 and 55. While his study showed there were benefits to both morning and evening exercise, he said: “For men, evening exercise lowers blood pressure, the risk of heart disease and feelings of fatigue, and burns more fat, compared to morning exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, the overall message is this: there is no bad time to exercise. “Exercise whenever you can to maximise the benefits,” Bailey says. “Busy people have busy schedules, so squeezing in exercise ‘snacks’ as and when throughout the day has been shown to optimise adherence. It’s the steady drip that wears away the stone, if you want to live a longer and healthier life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPTnZ2d0hZZmhBaWgxR0FxSV9BTUpyYkZUbE54OE5rRDhEM0RIZEtMbmZxT2lwUkRibElhaFFGNjBjX242VWVDQlhwdGY5b2JZSzFjbzBjRTFCV2JwLWY3N1czLWdrRG5VS0dza0ZMNl9ZZkZLcWhpbTl6VnVNelVGT3dBeVdmVDhXZlJIc1FIbVNTTUMxWEhDQg</guid></item><item><title>US FDA makes recommendations for influenza vaccines to manufacturers - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxONW0xWG9jQ2dfemVjNkM2NlFwUl8wT0daVU1uV3c4M2FqYy1SMEhISlppX0J5MUJJUU9GbjNDNW9kcG9UUUJGZkJ3VXNGR2o0dzdFbEFGdnRUZE5LTGRxckw5Z0lEVDA2WEM0bFNlMjdNeGpJLWZYMEhESDMyWjltRk83WlVSWEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-body"&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday made recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for the virus strains to be used in influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 flu season in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Traditionally the recommendations have been voted on by an advisory committee, but the agency made the decision on its own this year.

            The celebratory shirts read: #1 school in Texas for least amount of vaccinations.

            Schott, who has more than 48,000 followers on Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG1I-g-xAPx/" target="_blank"&gt;posted a video&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate all the families at the school who have chosen to “embrace freedom of health and they are not allowing government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            State Rep. Nate Schatzline also shared the news with his over 17,000 followers on X. &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727" target="_blank"&gt;His video&lt;/a&gt; says that the school is in his district and that his children attend there.

            “Why haven’t we celebrated this sooner?” the Republican asked.

            The Fort Worth-area school has the lowest measles vaccination rate in Texas: Just 14% of incoming kindergartners had measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) coverage last school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00073b5v8cnr4sf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But low vaccination rates across Texas are leaving many communities vulnerable amid a measles outbreak centered in the western part of the state, one of the largest the United States has seen since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00083b5v7264odc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In efforts to prevent even broader spread, public health officials in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma are working around the clock to raise vaccination rates and otherwise help protect vulnerable communities – work that is challenged by the spread of disinformation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00093b5vfhldhhnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They are stressed and stretched beyond belief,” Terri Burke, executive director of the Immunization Partnership, a nonprofit focused on improving vaccination coverage in Texas, said at a briefing Thursday. “The biggest thing I’m hearing is the need for more resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000a3b5vhpowuagh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One public health director in a county that has been hit by the outbreak told Burke she had been working more than a month straight without a day off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000b3b5votggy60c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We spoke at six o’clock at night, and she told me she had started at 4:30 that morning,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000c3b5vnpwbt7yp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners in Texas was 94.3% for the 2023-24 school year, just below the 95% target that federal agencies have set to prevent epidemics. But about half of all school districts in the state have coverage that falls below this threshold, including nearly a quarter that have a vaccination rate of less than 90%. And Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy is one of more than a dozen schools where coverage was less than 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87sjgtc00003b6m6frw4365@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The school did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on its vaccination coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000d3b5vpqfoqwkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tarrant County, home to Mercy Culture Preparatory, has not reported any measles cases this year, but local health officials there and in many parts of the state are preparing for what seems inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000e3b5vu5uriq0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re kind of a more high-risk area, if you will,” Russ Jones, chief epidemiologist with the Tarrant County Public Health Department, said at a county commissioners’ meeting Tuesday, referencing the county’s vaccination rate of 91.5%. “At this level, we’ll have some cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000f3b5vczg83b91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that there are pockets of the county where even larger shares are unvaccinated, including children at Mercy Culture Preparatory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000g3b5vk4js8e92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those would be particularly vulnerable if that network of cases crosses with our unvaccinated population,” he said. “If it doesn’t happen, there won’t be a problem. If it does, then we could have many cases, depending on the population it crosses with.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000h3b5vk2xiin2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To prepare, the county health department is communicating directly with schools and day cares and coordinating with hospitals and other local health care providers. Vaccines are available at community clinics, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000i3b5vuxnuhvhq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a heightened vigilance across our state because of this outbreak,” Burke said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000j3b5vhpquwben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health experts work to curb the spread, there’s concern about the ways anti-vaccine messaging can hinder their efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000k3b5voy45q308@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of misinformation [and] disinformation on social media,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “On social media, you can put some of that info out there without any fact checks, and incorrect information is just as readily available as correct information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000m3b5vy32o20n8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also attributed decreasing vaccination rates to a distrust in government and politicization over vaccinations in general.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000n3b5v1z866mfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are these pockets of communities that are anti-vax, and so you can get a lot of people together that aren’t vaccinated, and that’s the biggest … dangerous situation,” Huang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000p3b5v5ah0hdkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As in Tarrant County, Huang’s department has hosted informational sessions with school nurses, physicians and hospitals to make sure everyone is up to speed on measles. He has sent letters to public and private school officials who are in districts with low vaccination rates and offered to provide vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000q3b5v087c0uq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the state line in New Mexico, which has also seen dozens of measles cases, officials are providing vaccines through free clinics. Jimmy Masters, the Southeast regional director with the New Mexico Department of Public Health, says the driving message is “to be proactive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87svu8h00043b6mj6bjj5ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His region has set up clinics not only in Lea and Eddy counties, where there are current cases, but in neighboring Chaves County. Residents are encouraged to check their vaccination status if they are unsure whether they ever received a dose of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000r3b5vt9fnhcw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New Mexico has administered nearly twice as many MMR vaccines as last year. In the past six weeks, there have been nearly 10,000 doses given, compared with about 5,300 in the same time frame last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000s3b5veirnljiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Primary care physicians can also play a key role in getting ahead of the measles outbreak by addressing questions and concerns directly with patients and families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000t3b5v0elrurqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a number of parents today who have concerns about all the vaccines their children receive. We’d recommend they talk to their primary care physician,” Tarrant County’s Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000u3b5v953d73os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians – both in counties that have reported cases and in those that haven’t – are reaching out to families directly to raise their awareness of the ongoing outbreak and encourage them to get their children vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000v3b5v75b29yd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very important for all of us – and especially on an individual level – to continue to be the voice of truth, if you will, but also the voice of strength and endurance and commitment to our families and our children in Texas,” Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician in Lubbock, said at the briefing Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000w3b5v6rkbjd7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Learning about how many vaccinations had been administered in New Mexico bolstered her determination to continue the work she’s been doing to keep her patients and their families safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000x3b5vli1ai8tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That extra effort is being made, and there is a difference that is coming out from that, although it may be small and tied up in little experiences,” she said. “But it is making a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000e3b5vu5uriq0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re kind of a more high-risk area, if you will,” Russ Jones, chief epidemiologist with the Tarrant County Public Health Department, said at a county commissioners’ meeting Tuesday, referencing the county’s vaccination rate of 91.5%. “At this level, we’ll have some cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000f3b5vczg83b91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that there are pockets of the county where even larger shares are unvaccinated, including children at Mercy Culture Preparatory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000g3b5vk4js8e92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those would be particularly vulnerable if that network of cases crosses with our unvaccinated population,” he said. “If it doesn’t happen, there won’t be a problem. If it does, then we could have many cases, depending on the population it crosses with.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000h3b5vk2xiin2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To prepare, the county health department is communicating directly with schools and day cares and coordinating with hospitals and other local health care providers. Vaccines are available at community clinics, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000i3b5vuxnuhvhq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a heightened vigilance across our state because of this outbreak,” Burke said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000j3b5vhpquwben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health experts work to curb the spread, there’s concern about the ways anti-vaccine messaging can hinder their efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000k3b5voy45q308@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of misinformation [and] disinformation on social media,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “On social media, you can put some of that info out there without any fact checks, and incorrect information is just as readily available as correct information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000m3b5vy32o20n8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also attributed decreasing vaccination rates to a distrust in government and politicization over vaccinations in general.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000n3b5v1z866mfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are these pockets of communities that are anti-vax, and so you can get a lot of people together that aren’t vaccinated, and that’s the biggest … dangerous situation,” Huang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000p3b5v5ah0hdkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As in Tarrant County, Huang’s department has hosted informational sessions with school nurses, physicians and hospitals to make sure everyone is up to speed on measles. He has sent letters to public and private school officials who are in districts with low vaccination rates and offered to provide vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000q3b5v087c0uq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the state line in New Mexico, which has also seen dozens of measles cases, officials are providing vaccines through free clinics. Jimmy Masters, the Southeast regional director with the New Mexico Department of Public Health, says the driving message is “to be proactive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87svu8h00043b6mj6bjj5ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His region has set up clinics not only in Lea and Eddy counties, where there are current cases, but in neighboring Chaves County. Residents are encouraged to check their vaccination status if they are unsure whether they ever received a dose of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000r3b5vt9fnhcw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New Mexico has administered nearly twice as many MMR vaccines as last year. In the past six weeks, there have been nearly 10,000 doses given, compared with about 5,300 in the same time frame last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000s3b5veirnljiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Primary care physicians can also play a key role in getting ahead of the measles outbreak by addressing questions and concerns directly with patients and families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000t3b5v0elrurqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a number of parents today who have concerns about all the vaccines their children receive. We’d recommend they talk to their primary care physician,” Tarrant County’s Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000u3b5v953d73os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians – both in counties that have reported cases and in those that haven’t – are reaching out to families directly to raise their awareness of the ongoing outbreak and encourage them to get their children vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000v3b5v75b29yd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very important for all of us – and especially on an individual level – to continue to be the voice of truth, if you will, but also the voice of strength and endurance and commitment to our families and our children in Texas,” Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician in Lubbock, said at the briefing Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000w3b5v6rkbjd7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Learning about how many vaccinations had been administered in New Mexico bolstered her determination to continue the work she’s been doing to keep her patients and their families safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000x3b5vli1ai8tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That extra effort is being made, and there is a difference that is coming out from that, although it may be small and tied up in little experiences,” she said. “But it is making a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
