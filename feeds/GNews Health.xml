It helps regulate the body’s sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm). Melatonin levels rise in the evening, promoting drowsiness, and fall in the morning, promoting wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplement is heavily regulated as a prescription-only medication in many parts of the world, including the UK, the EU and Australia. But in the US, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-e06c3c60-aace-11f0-889a-21cc4e50b213"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; regulates it as an over-the-counter option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 67 million Americans take melatonin, and analysts predict sales of the supplement will top $588 million in 2025, up from $339 million in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as adults turn to the hormone in droves to help kick insomnia, children are also being introduced to it, either intentionally by parents to aid fussy sleepers or by mistaking appetizing-looking melatonin gummies for a sweet treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study by the &lt;span&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that almost half (46 percent) of parents have given melatonin to a child under the age of 13 to help them fall asleep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2022, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-ca335fb0-9f06-11f0-a9b9-b94c99276d56"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; revealed how, in the decade leading up to 2021, poison helplines dealt with 260,435 calls about children who had taken too much melatonin, a 530 percent increase from 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2012, melatonin was responsible for one percent of pediatric poisonings. That rose to five percent in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health experts are warning about the 'terrifying' rise of melatonin addiction and overdoses among children in the US, with little known about the long-term consequences of taking the sleep aid (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the poison reports, two children died, five were put on a ventilator to help them breathe, nearly 300 ended up in intensive care and more than 4,000 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melatonin &lt;span&gt;is naturally produced in the brain's pineal gland, and its release into the body is controlled by light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the day, melatonin levels in the body are low and we feel awake, but when the sun sets, more melatonin circulates in the body, preparing people for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melatonin may be suggested to adults to help them fall or stay asleep, but the substance is generally not recommended for children without medical guidance because little is known about its long-term impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keith Vossel, a neurologist at the University Of California Los Angeles, told the Daily Mail he would not recommend giving children melatonin as it is a hormone and 'could have effects on the timing of puberty, metabolism and immune system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown a link between melatonin intake and delayed puberty, as well as an &lt;span&gt;affect on related hormonal pathways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because melatonin interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis - the hormonal system that controls puberty - so 'we need to be cautious and longer-term studies are needed,' Vossel said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Vossel, Dr Rachel Toles, a clinical psychologist in California, told the Daily Mail she is concerned about the melatonin abuse among both adults and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Melatonin should never be the first solution for children’s sleep,' she said. 'It’s a hormone, not a harmless vitamin, and the long-term effects on developing brains are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The big issue is that the supplements look like candy and they are often left within children’s reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some parents also give melatonin to their kids too freely, and it has become a cultural quick fix for sleep, which is concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a possible impact on puberty, Toles said it can negatively affect the metabolism and immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melatonin can negatively affect metabolism by disrupting glucose regulation and weight balance when misused, and may impair immune function by suppressing necessary inflammatory responses if overused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking melatonin at the wrong time can disrupt insulin release and circadian control of glucose, leading to poor blood sugar control and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, excess melatonin can overly suppress pro-inflammatory signals, weakening necessary immune responses to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toles said that parents should also be aware that m&lt;span&gt;elatonin 'can cause grogginess, headaches and even more wakefulness at higher doses.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The real danger is using it to mask bigger issues like screen time, anxiety or inconsistent routines,' she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is also the possibility of children getting hooked on the supplement and their sleep getting worse in the long run. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A typical dose for melatonin ranges from one to 3mg, taken about 30 minutes before bedtime, with most people rarely needing more than 5mg (Pictured: melatonin gummies on a store shelf)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Reddit, dozens of parents have revealed horror stories involving melatonin and their children. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One mother revealed that she gives her son, who has autism and ADHD, one milligram of melatonin when on vacation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A typical adult dose for melatonin ranges from one milligram to 3mg, taken about 30 minutes before bedtime, with most people rarely needing more than 5mg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The recommended dose for young children is significantly lower (for three- to five-year-olds the dose is suggested not to exceed one milligram), and this amount can lead to a range of moderate to severe symptoms such as drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, nausea and agitation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mother said she accidentally left the bottle of gummies in her two-year-old daughter's room, and the infant ended up taking in 26mg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ingesting 26mg of melatonin is a serious overdose for a toddler and requires immediate medical attention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mother said she called poison control and they told her to monitor her daughter at home but to visit the ER if any symptoms worsened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A CDC report released in early 2022 revealed that in the decade leading up to 2021, poison helplines dealt with 260,435 calls about children who had taken too much melatonin (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Facebook, Beth McCarty from Vancouver revealed her 11-year-old son, Ethan, took 18 melatonin gummies as he had watched his father take large doses of medication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharing photos of Ethan looking drowsy in the back of an ambulance, she wrote: '&lt;/span&gt;So deeply thankful for the medics [and] poison control who responded after Ethan was literally laied [sic] out and plastered to the living room rug. They were all so calm with us and our boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Parents, WATCH your kiddos with ANY med. Ethan sure knows never to try anything like this again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another post, Iowa-based mental health coach Marci Hanzelka McKinnon shared how she unknowingly got her son hooked on melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a warning to other parents, she wrote: 'Yep, we are guilty. We gave our son melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No one knew (or no one told us) back then the dangers of using melatonin for our child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At that time the highest dose was 10mg; that was considered extremely high. We started him at 3mg and slowly kept moving it up because it stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iowa-based mental health coach Marci Hanzelka McKinnon (pictured) shared how she unknowingly got her son hooked on melatonin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eventually we reached 10mg. Once that stopped working we stopped giving it to him and were no better off than we were before we started using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today, you can get 50mg of melatonin! That’s unbelievable! And so dangerous!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of the doctors the Daily Mail spoke to agreed that sleep has become harder for children in the modern world with increased exposure to technology and busier schedules. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, they all advised against melatonin as a solution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Los Angeles-based Dr Raj Dasgupta, the chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis, said the best thing to do before turning to sleep aids is to figure out why the child isn't sleeping first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'S&lt;span&gt;ometimes it’s as simple as bedtime habits or anxiety,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I usually tell parents to exhaust all behavioral approaches before reaching for medication or supplements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Dr David Sinclair, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said that '&lt;/span&gt;Natural alternatives are best' for addressing sleep issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Try] consistent bedtime routines, dimming lights in the evening and keeping screens out of the bedroom, and making sure kids get enough daylight and physical activity during the day,' he told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have seen cases where children were put on melatonin for sleep and it helped in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in most situations, once children get exercise, nighttime lights are dimmed and devices are taken away before bedtime, they didn’t need the supplement anymore.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 20:27:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxObzI3dnQ4cUVfZ0tOUWhxSDdqYnNxV0loVzdIbnFUYjZxVHV3WWg1TUpEMmZSUGJFdm81amc2OFQyNGNXWmttVGozdlI5R2RfOTlsQmNrbnJYOE1QWWRQS0MtTzBkVnRkOWhhUmlpUzZqVTd1d1VheWdRRFlUVld4V2JxMjduNVNVRTNIWkR4RndDN1dKbVE</guid></item><item><title>世界更年期日：支持女性，加强系统-财富</title><link>https://fortune.com/2025/10/18/world-menopause-day-world-economic-forum-womens-health-support-women-october-18/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause has long been treated as a quiet, private ordeal. That silence carries a cost. On World Menopause Day, bringing menopause out of the shadows is not a niche concern but a public priority with tangible dividends for health, equity, and economic growth. The conversation must move from scattered efforts to a coordinated plan that is practical to implement in clinics, workplaces, and national policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="paywall"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause and menopause can span more than a decade. At any given moment, more than 450 million women worldwide are navigating this transition. According to research by the World Economic Forum’s Global Alliance for Women’s Health, closing the women’s health gap on menopause alone could yield an &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/blueprint-to-close-the-women-s-health-gap-how-to-improve-lives-and-economies-for-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.weforum.org/publications/blueprint-to-close-the-women-s-health-gap-how-to-improve-lives-and-economies-for-all/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;estimated 2.4 million disability adjusted life years every year and roughly 120 billion dollars in annual GDP gains.&lt;/a&gt; These figures represent fewer missed workdays, steadier household income, and less strain on health systems. They also represent lives experienced with more comfort, clarity, and confidence. Numbers summarize the stakes, but lived experience explains them.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stands in the way is not a lack of need but a lack of preparation across the systems that touch women’s lives. Diagnosis and care are often late, inconsistent, or inaccessible. And there is evidence to back this — a Yale University &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2015/03000/Incremental_direct_and_indirect_costs_of_untreated.5.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2015/03000/Incremental_direct_and_indirect_costs_of_untreated.5.aspx" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of insurance claims showed while 60% of women with significant symptoms of menopause seek treatment, almost 75% are left untreated. Training is part of the problem. &lt;a href="https://healthmatch.io/blog/why-are-there-so-many-menopause-knowledge-gaps" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://healthmatch.io/blog/why-are-there-so-many-menopause-knowledge-gaps" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;In one study&lt;/a&gt;, half of family medicine doctors reported only a single lecture on menopause during training, and one in five reported none at all. The workforce impact is visible. Research indicates that one in four women has considered leaving work during the transition, and one in ten who have worked through menopause left a job because of their symptoms. This is not only a productivity story, it is also one of opportunity cost. It is a story about experienced leaders stepping back, about teams losing anchors, and about families absorbing avoidable stress.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Expert Member of the one-of-its-kind multistakeholder platform, the World Economic Forum’s &lt;a href="https://initiatives.weforum.org/global-alliance-for-womens-health/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://initiatives.weforum.org/global-alliance-for-womens-health/home" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Global Alliance for Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an expert medical advisor at acclaimed actress, director, producer, advocate, and entrepreneur, Halle Berry’s menopause care platform, &lt;a href="https://www.respin.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.respin.health/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Respin Health&lt;/a&gt;, I see how quickly the conversation shifts when evidence meets execution. These organisations are helping translate science into clinical standards and employer policies, while informing policy frameworks that leaders can adopt and fund. Advocacy is meaningful when it results in actions that are easy to copy, measure, and sustain. Our work with Halle Berry, who &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7381282254116921344" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7381282254116921344" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;recently joined the Global Alliance for Women’s Health as Public Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;, showcases the sheer appetite and momentum that exists to redefine menopause and empower women to be the guardians of their own health. The path is known. What remains is follow-through.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we leave women to figure menopause out alone, we pay a grave price in health, productivity, and our very own dignity. We have to normalize this conversation about menopause. We have to make guidance useable. We have to improve access to quality care, and we need to invest in research and innovation,” said Halle Berry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Health care is the first place to start&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menopause should be part of routine primary care, not a specialty service that only a few can reach. Screening can begin during routine visits for women in their forties and fifties, with clear pathways for counselling and treatment. Evidence based options include lifestyle approaches, non-hormonal treatments, and, when appropriate and safe, hormonal therapies guided by informed choice. Care should consider mental health and cardiometabolic risk, since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377487/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;sleep disruption, mood changes, and metabolic shifts&lt;/a&gt; often travel together. Referral pathways must connect primary care, gynaecology, mental health, and cardiometabolic services so women are not left to navigate a maze with contradictory advice. This is not about boutique clinics for the few. It is about equipping the front lines to meet a ubiquitous need.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workplaces are the next lever. Simple adjustments can make a meaningful difference. Flexibility where feasible, paid time off for symptom flare days, and practical measures like temperature control and quiet rest areas reduce the friction that turns symptoms into lost days. Benefits should name menopause explicitly, so women know coverage exists. Manager training should normalize support without forcing disclosure. Employers who measure retention, error rates, and team performance before and after adopting these practices will find what many have already learned. Small investments stabilize teams and pay for themselves.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and product design must close the data gap and raise the bar for solutions. Studies should reflect the diversity of real women, including race, age, and co existing conditions. Endpoints should be comparable so clinicians and consumers can tell what works and for whom. Digital tools and consumer products that target sleep, cognition, thermoregulation, and pelvic health should be evaluated against evidence standards and priced for broad access. Innovation is welcome. So is rigor. Women deserve both.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Policy and financing can turn best practice into the baseline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Essential menopause services belong in national primary health packages and in public and private insurance coverage. Governments can accelerate employer adoption with clear standards, public recognition, and targeted incentives that reward organizations for implementing menopause supportive policies. Public information campaigns can replace stigma with practical knowledge for women, partners, managers, and clinicians. Countries should publish a small set of indicators that matter in daily life. Time to diagnosis, treatment access, and workforce participation are simple to understand and powerful to track. Accountability is easier when the yardstick is clear.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter beyond the clinic and the workplace? Because when women’s health is prioritized, families and economies function better. Earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment reduce absenteeism. Menopause supportive workplaces keep experienced talent on the job and reduce turnover. Good care prevents avoidable complications that are costly later. These mechanisms repeat across millions of women and thousands of organizations. The cumulative effect shows up in national productivity. The more important return, however, is human. Better sleep, clearer thinking, steadier mood, and restored confidence change how women experience midlife. That is growth measured in dignity and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective advocacy pairs public leadership with technical depth and coordinated action. Public figures help make the issue relatable. Researchers and clinicians define what quality care looks like. Cross-sector forums align employers, health systems, and governments on practical standards and timelines. This combination turns awareness into accountable implementation. This is where platforms such as the Global Alliance for Women’s Health and the International Menopause Society bring real value to the conversation — by bringing together experts and leaders to make the shift from intention to implementation. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What should happen now? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health systems can add a brief screening and counselling step to routine primary care visits and build simple referral pathways that do not collapse under real world pressure. Medical schools and continuing education providers can strengthen training, so the next generation of clinicians starts on firmer ground. Employers can publish a menopause policy, train managers, and update benefits language so support is easy to find. Researchers can design studies that reflect the diversity of women and use shared endpoints that allow transparent comparisons. Policymakers can put menopause care in the basic benefit package and require transparent reporting on access and outcomes. None of these actions is a moonshot. Each is a choice that aligns with what we already know.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture change travels alongside policy change. Partners can listen without judgment. Friends can share what has helped them. Community leaders can include menopause in health talks that already reach women where they live and work. The tone matters. Precision matters. A plan matters. Together they create an environment where a woman does not have to spend years searching for a name for her symptoms or for a path to relief.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Menopause&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Day should not be a once-a-year reminder. It should be a yearly accountability moment that asks a simple question: Did we make it easier this year for women to find accurate information, timely care, and practical support? If the answer is yes, the benefits will be visible in clinics, workplaces, homes, and countries.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path is clear — what remains is resolve. Let us act today so more women can live, work, and thrive tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="5"&gt;

However, between what doctors who spoke to HuffPost are observing in their clinics ― along with the data available ― it does appear that we are beyond the late-summer, early fall peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We may not have another peak this year, but “my guess is that it’ll pick back up again when people start gathering, staying indoors more, being in close proximity to each other,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While COVID-19 may be low, there appears to be one illness that’s increasing right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-lies-misconceptions?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical Professionals Are Calling Out The Biggest &amp;quot;Health Misconceptions&amp;quot; People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Medical Professionals Are Calling Out The Biggest "Health Misconceptions" People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Simpleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/fabianabuontempo/small-habits-that-can-change-your-body?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:People Are Sharing The "Harmless" Habits That Changed Their Bodies Forever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;People Are Sharing The "Harmless" Habits That Changed Their Bodies Forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You may be surprised to hear that COVID-19 cases are dipping, especially if you’re one of the many people fighting congestion and a sore throat this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If we look at our own data from Northeast Ohio ... if we looked at this most recent week from our data, and this is specimens that are collected in our lab, the SARS-CoV-2 activity continued to decline from its ‘summer peak,’” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/steven-gordon/4269710" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Gordon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Steven Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the Department of Infectious Disease at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the Cleveland Clinic, COVID positivity rate was 5% last week, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What is higher up, and has been for the past few weeks, is the rhinovirus, which causes the traditional cold, as well as other enterovirus [which also cause cold symptoms] — and those are at 20% positivity,” Gordon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While Gordon is specifically referring to cases in Northeast Ohio, his findings align with the CDC data that’s available, which shows cases of rhinovirus and enterovirus were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasing as of the end of September;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increasing as of the end of September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are steps you can take to stay healthy this fall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Skynesher / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinlouiseduncombe/vagina-atrophy-prolapse-menopause-beauty-standards?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Doctor Looked At My Vagina And Said 3 Shocking Words.

The best protection against the flu is the flu shot, “and it’s still recommended for anyone greater than six months of age,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to prevent a severe COVID-19 infection and hospitalization is by getting the COVID shot, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Now that we have COVID vaccination available and influenza vaccination available, it takes several weeks for us to develop immunity, so now is a really great time to get vaccinated,” Sood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;COVID vaccination is still a safe and effective way to reduce how sick you get. “There was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a study that just came out;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a study that just came out&lt;/a&gt; ... showing that in the VA [Veterans] Health Systems, that even in this last season, COVID-19 vaccination reduced hospitalizations, deaths and ER visits in the VA population,” Sood explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can get your &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2025-26-covid-19-vaccine-and-flu-shots/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu shot and COVID shot at the same time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;flu shot and COVID shot at the same time&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re available at pharmacies throughout the country. It’s best to talk to your doctor or local pharmacy about COVID shot eligibility in your area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also important to take care of your health overall by &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/fitness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt; and eating nutritious meals, Sood said. This can help protect you from respiratory viruses. Washing your hands is also a good way to stay well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Another thing people can do is stay away from people that are sick,” said Foster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re at the airport and notice someone is coughing and sneezing near you, get up and move. Or if you’re the one sneezing and coughing, stay home or wear a mask if you have to be around other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s part of good citizenship, of trying to protect other people,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At-home COVID-19 (or flu) tests are also important tools for respiratory virus season. If you test positive, stay away from other people and let your doctor know to see if you’re eligible for certain medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Olena Domanytska / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/mundane-behaviors-impact-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think we’ve sort of lost that sense of community a little bit ... what I do impacts others,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You never know if the person you’re sitting next to at a restaurant or passing by at the office has a problem with their immune system. “You might be giving them a death sentence when what you needed to do was either stay home or at least wear a mask when you went out in public. And that’s not that hard to do,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While COVID-19 cases aren’t high right now, that can change at any moment, which makes it important to take steps to stop the spread of the virus and to protect those around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-cases-lull-october-2025_l_68e7eb40e4b0a9f46d0c848d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/caradaniellebrown/friendship-breakup-best-friend-ghosted-reason?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Best Friend And I Stopped Talking For 5 Years.

A study conducted by researchers at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/george-mason-university" target="_blank"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that individuals who consumed mango daily had better blood sugar control and reduced body fat compared to those who opted for low-sugar snacks. The study’s findings, published in Foods in August 2025 under the title “Daily Mango Intake Improves Glycemic and Body Composition Outcomes in Adults with Prediabetes: A Randomized Controlled Study,” emphasize that the nutritional context of sugar within whole foods plays a more crucial role than the sugar content alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Science Behind Mango’s Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Science Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Raedeh Basiri, Assistant Professor in George Mason’s Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, explained that it’s not simply about how much sugar food contains, but about the overall nutritional makeup. Mangoes, for instance, offer a unique balance—while they contain natural sugars, these are accompanied by fiber, antioxidants, and essential vitamins. This combination helps slow sugar absorption, keeping blood glucose levels stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124570023" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, foods that contain added sugars—such as processed cereals or packaged low-sugar snacks—lack this natural balance and can actually heighten the risk of developing diabetes. The fiber in mangoes supports digestion and promotes satiety, helping control appetite and preventing overeating, which further aids weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glycemic Index and Safe Consumption Tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangoes fall within a moderate range on the glycemic index (GI), scoring between 51 and 56, a range comparable to orange juice. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/american-diabetes-association" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (ADA), this places mangoes in the low-to-medium GI category, making them suitable for moderate consumption. The ADA recommends choosing fruits that are fresh, frozen, or canned without added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124570023" id="div-vdoai-mid-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of fruit should provide around 15 grams of carbohydrates, which roughly equals two-thirds of a cup of mango. The ADA also notes that fresh fruit tends to be more satisfying than dried varieties, as the portion size of dried fruit is smaller and can lead to excessive intake of sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124570023" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional Health Perks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond controlling blood sugar, mangoes may also improve cholesterol levels. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2011 observed that mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with freeze-dried mango exhibited lower body fat, reduced cholesterol, and improved glucose levels compared to those treated with lipid- or sugar-lowering drugs like fenofibrate and rosiglitazone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores that incorporating whole fruits like mangoes into one’s diet not only satisfies sweet cravings naturally but also supports metabolic health, making this tropical fruit a surprisingly smart choice for balanced living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Signs Of High Blood Sugar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a Cleveland Clinic report, early signs of high blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, often appear gradually and may include excessive thirst or hunger, frequent urination, headaches, and blurred vision. These symptoms occur as the body struggles to manage rising glucose levels. If left unchecked for a longer period, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to more serious issues such as persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, recurring vaginal yeast or skin infections, and slow-healing cuts or sores. Recognizing these warning signals early is crucial, as timely lifestyle changes and medical intervention can help prevent severe complications like nerve damage or diabetes-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 16:15:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当助听器还不够时--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/health/cochlear-implants-older-people.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:29:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNMDZ0U2dXYTN0MXdWanVzT2RGek8wOXYzaDk0TmlqYldvWkZ2NUhmdERxZmNHXzVXSUpOR05WLWhINjEyeU9lN0xWWVVZLVd1N2JIUHZVRUdIQXNYRldrQzdTRkU0YUt2eU9ISFdsYkNNRmNWeW9VazBLRmFMVzhtVFVBMA</guid></item><item><title>意见：世界更年期日将犹他州更年期护理差距置于聚光灯下-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-world-menopause-day-puts-140000477.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oct. 18 is designated as World Menopause Day by the &lt;a href="https://www.imsociety.org/education/world-menopause-day-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Menopause Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;International Menopause Society&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the day is to raise awareness of menopause and the support options available for improving health and well-being. So it’s the right moment to examine how the U.S. and Utah perform on menopause care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer than 5% of American women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT), according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2823976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, to help manage symptoms they experience during the menopause transition. Compare that with an HRT usage rate closer to 15% in the U.K. and Australia, where prescribing is steadily rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;American health care practitioners are not well prepared: only &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30701-8/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6.8%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;6.8%&lt;/a&gt; of family medicine, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology residents reported feeling adequately prepared to manage women experiencing menopause transition symptoms, according to a 2019 Mayo Clinic survey. Six years later, that has undoubtedly risen with the increasing general awareness of menopause, but it’s still shockingly low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Utahns face some additional challenges. The state does fairly well on the ratio of obstetricians and gynecologists (OB-GYNs) to women, ranking &lt;a href="https://www.beckersphysicianleadership.com/physician-workforce/womens-health-providers-by-state-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18th;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;18th&lt;/a&gt; in the country. However, as a state with one of the highest birth rates, Utah OB-GYNs are busy with maternal care rather than menopause care. While women often think to turn first to their OB-GYNs for help with menopause, they might not be the best equipped. Primary care physicians (PCPs) can provide menopause care, but Utah has one of the &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/rankings-and-ratings/states-ranked-by-total-primary-care-physicians-in-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worst ratios of PCPs to residents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;worst ratios of PCPs to residents&lt;/a&gt; in the entire United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Medication options are also more limited in the U.S. There are no approved testosterone treatments for menopausal women despite the fact that in appropriate dosages, testosterone can increase energy, improve sexual function, and preserve muscle mass and bone health. American doctors only prescribe testosterone to women “off label,” whereas Australia offers a cream approved specifically for postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The shadow of old data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So why is the U.S. so different in our approach to menopause care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Much of the hesitation originates with a Women’s Health Initiative study published in 2002. The data from that study was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10758198/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presented in black-and-white terms that overstated risks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;presented in black-and-white terms that overstated risks&lt;/a&gt;. But those headlines stuck, and two decades later, many women are still paying the price. It takes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:17 years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;17 years&lt;/a&gt; on average for medical research updates to translate into day-to-day medical practice. This is far too long for women to wait for effective and appropriate menopause care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the need to close the gap between current medical practice and new research, the U.S. still lacks adequate medical training around menopause. Only &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-survey-menopause-residency.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:31.3%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;31.3%&lt;/a&gt; of obstetrics and gynecology residency program directors report they have any type of menopause curriculum as part of their residents’ training. For most, this curriculum consists of one to two lectures per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The human cost of delay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When menopause symptoms go untreated, the costs are high. Sleep suffers. Cognitive function declines. Emotional well-being takes a hit. Productivity at work drops. And over time, without hormone replacement intervention, health risks can mount — most specifically, increases in osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and the likelihood of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So better menopause care isn’t just a women’s health issue. It’s a public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While we don’t know everything about hormones, in large part because of a significant gap in research on women’s health specifically, the overwhelming consensus today is that &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/hrt-breast-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HRT is both safe for most women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HRT is both safe for most women&lt;/a&gt; and the most effective solution to treat menopause-related symptoms. And it should be readily available. This requires better education for health care providers, more specialized and holistic care, and less stigma. It also means giving women space to track their own symptoms, understand what’s changing and decide what “forward” looks like for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s why I founded &lt;a href="http://inflexxionhealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inflexxion Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Inflexxion Health&lt;/a&gt; — so that together, we can ensure that women in Utah no longer have to wait for the care they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.imsociety.org/education/world-menopause-day-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Menopause Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Menopause Day&lt;/a&gt;, awareness must translate into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOM2NtUWVXUjlobnRmamxSQ1lkZE5LNXZhMExkVmdJa3NUQ3U5LWlpTjVwRzgtSjZOdlJFRFl5NjZNS09GY3h3cVpFUUttN1dVR3dwZV8wcTBsZXk4M3gzNGh0bHhqTElGWjRIUDRiMHJHUnhnbFJoY3FnTEctVXpxQXA4MF9oNHZSUU5j</guid></item><item><title>我们是否生活在一个愚蠢的黄金时代？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/18/are-we-living-in-a-golden-age-of-stupidity-technology</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;tep into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab in Cambridge, US, and the future feels a little closer. Glass cabinets display prototypes of weird and wonderful creations, from tiny desktop robots to a surrealist sculpture created by an AI model prompted to design a tea set made from body parts. In the lobby, an AI waste-sorting assistant named Oscar can tell you where to put your used coffee cup. Five floors up, research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna has been working on wearable brain-computer interfaces she hopes will one day enable people who cannot speak, due to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, to communicate using their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kosmyna spends a lot of her time reading and analysing people’s brain states. Another project she is working on is a wearable device – one prototype looks like a pair of glasses – that can tell when someone is getting confused or losing focus. Around two years ago, she began receiving out-of-the blue emails from strangers who reported that they had started using large language models such as ChatGPT and felt their brain had changed as a result. Their memories didn’t seem as good – was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side – were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked. And if they were using AI, how much did they even understand of the answers they were giving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With some MIT colleagues, Kosmyna set up an experiment that used an electroencephalogram to monitor people’s brain activity while they wrote essays, either with no digital assistance, or with the help of an internet search engine, or ChatGPT. She found that the more external help participants had, the lower their level of brain connectivity, so those who used ChatGPT to write showed significantly less activity in the brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, whatever the people using ChatGPT felt was going on inside their brains, the scans showed there wasn’t much happening up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study’s participants, who were all enrolled at MIT or nearby universities, were asked, right after they had handed in their work, if they could recall what they had written. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could give a quote,” Kosmyna says. “That was concerning, because you just wrote it and you do not remember anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kosmyna is 35, trendily dressed in a blue shirt dress and a big, multicoloured necklace, and she speaks faster than most people can think. As she observes, writing an essay requires skills that are important in our wider lives: the ability to synthesise information, consider competing perspectives and construct an argument. You use these skills in everyday conversations. “How are you going to deal with that? Are you going to be, like, ‘Err … can I just check my phone?’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experiment was small (54 participants) and has not yet been peer reviewed. In June, however, Kosmyna posted it online, thinking other researchers might find it interesting, and then she went about her day, unaware that she had just created an international media frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alongside the journalist requests, she received more than 4,000 emails from around the world, many from stressed-out teachers who feel their students aren’t learning properly because they are using ChatGPT to do their homework. They worry AI is creating a generation who can produce passable work but don’t have any usable knowledge or understanding of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The fundamental issue, Kosmyna says, is that as soon as a technology becomes available that makes our lives easier, we’re evolutionarily primed to use it. “Our brains love shortcuts, it’s in our nature. But your brain needs friction to learn. It needs to have a challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If brains need friction but also instinctively avoid it, it’s interesting that the promise of technology has been to create a “frictionless” user experience, to ensure that, provided we slide from app to app or screen to screen, we will meet no resistance. The frictionless user experience is why we unthinkingly offload ever more information and work to our digital devices; it’s why internet rabbit holes are so easy to fall down and so hard to climb out of; it’s why generative AI has already integrated itself so completely into most people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We know, from our collective experience, that once you become accustomed to the hyperefficient cybersphere, the friction-filled real world feels harder to deal with. So you avoid phone calls, use self-checkouts, order everything from an app; you reach for your phone to do the maths sum you could do in your head, to check a fact before you have to dredge it up from memory, to input your destination on Google maps and travel from A to B on autopilot. Maybe you &lt;a href="https://www.arts.gov/stories/blog/2024/federal-data-reading-pleasure-all-signs-show-slump#:~:text=Last%20fall,%20the%20NEA%20reported,54.6%20percent%20ten%20years%20earlier." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stop reading books&lt;/a&gt; because maintaining that kind of focus feels like friction; maybe you dream of owning a self-driving car. Is this the dawn of what the writer and education expert Daisy Christodoulou calls a “&lt;a href="https://substack.nomoremarking.com/p/are-we-living-in-a-stupidogenic-society" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stupidogenic society&lt;/a&gt;”, a parallel to an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/20/young-people-obesity-2030-report" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;obesogenic society&lt;/a&gt;, in which it is easy to become stupid because machines can think for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;AI companies are determined to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Human intelligence is too broad and varied to be reduced to words such as “stupid”, but there are worrying signs that all this digital convenience is costing us dearly. Across the economically developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Pisa scores, which measure 15-year-olds’ reading, maths and science, &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/0S5wK#selection-3313.60-3313.87" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tended to peak around 2012&lt;/a&gt;. While over the 20th century IQ scores increased globally, perhaps due to improved access to education and better nutrition, in many developed countries they appear to have been declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Falling test and IQ scores are the subject of hot debate. What is harder to dispute is that, with every technological advance, we deepen our dependence on digital devices and find it harder to work or remember or think or, frankly, function without them. “It’s only software developers and drug dealers who call people users,” Kosmyna mutters at one point, frustrated at AI companies’ determination to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the ever-expanding, frictionless online world, you are first and foremost a user: passive, dependent. In the dawning era of AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, how will we maintain the scepticism and intellectual independence we’ll need? By the time we agree that our minds are no longer our own, that we simply cannot think clearly without tech assistance, how much of us will be left to resist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;tart telling people that you’re worried about what intelligent machines are doing to our brains and there’s a risk that, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will laugh at what a fuddy-duddy you were. Socrates worried that writing would weaken people’s memories and encourage only superficial understanding: not wisdom but “the conceit of wisdom” – an argument that is strikingly similar to many critiques of AI. What happened instead was that writing and the technological advances that followed – the printing press, mass media, the internet era – meant that ever more people had access to ever more information. More people could develop great ideas, and they could share those ideas more easily, and this made us cleverer and more innovative, as individuals and as communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After all, writing didn’t only change how we access and retain information; it changed how we think. A person can achieve more complex tasks with a notebook and paper to hand than without: most people can’t work out 53,683 divided by 7 in their head but could have a stab at doing long division on paper. I couldn’t have dictated this piece, but writing helped me organise and clarify my thoughts. As humans, we’re very good at what experts call “cognitive offloading”, namely using our physical environment to reduce our mental load, and this in turn helps us achieve more complex cognitive tasks. Imagine how much harder it would be to function each day without a calendar or phone reminders, or without Google to remember everything for you. In the best case scenario, intelligent people working in partnership with intelligent machines will achieve new intellectual feats and solve tricky problems: we’re already seeing, for instance, how AI can help scientists discover &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03434-4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new drugs faster&lt;/a&gt; and doctors detect &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/artificial-intelligence" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancer earlier and more efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The complication is, if technology is truly making us cleverer – turning us into efficient, information-processing machines – why do we spend so much time feeling dumb?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of the year, a term that captures both the specific feeling of mindlessness that descends when we spend too much time scrolling through rubbish online and the corrosive, aggressively dumb content itself, the nonsense memes and AI garble. When we hold our phones we have, in theory, most of the world’s accumulated knowledge at our fingertips, so why do we spend so much time dragging our eyeballs over dreck?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One issue is that our digital devices have not been designed to help us think more efficiently and clearly; almost everything we encounter online has been designed to capture and monetise our attention. Each time you reach for your phone with the intention of completing a simple, discrete, potentially self-improving task, such as checking the news, your primitive hunter-gatherer brain confronts a multibillion-pound tech industry devoted to throwing you off course and holding your attention, no matter what. To extend Christodoulou ’s metaphor, in the same way that one feature of an obesogenic society are food deserts – whole neighbourhoods in which you cannot buy a healthy meal – large parts of the internet are information deserts, in which the only available brain food is junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Digital multitasking gives you a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the late 90s the tech consultant Linda Stone, who was working as a professor at New York University, noticed that her students were using technology very differently from her colleagues at Microsoft, where she also worked. While her Microsoft colleagues were disciplined about working on two screens – one for emails, perhaps, and another for Word, or a spreadsheet – her students seemed to be trying to do 20 things at once. She coined the term “continuous partial attention” to describe the stressful, involuntarily state we often find ourselves in when we’re trying to toggle between several cognitively demanding activities, such as responding to emails while on a Zoom call. When I first heard the term I realised that I, like most people I know, live most of my life in a state of continuous partial attention, whether I’m guiltily checking my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with my kids, or incessantly sidetracked by texts and emails when I’m trying to write, or trying to relax while watching Netflix and simultaneously doing an online food shop, still wondering why I feel as chilled-out as an over-microwaved dinner. Digital multitasking makes us feel productive, but this is often illusory. “You have a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything,” Stone tells me. It also makes you feel permanently on edge: one study she conducted found that 80% of people experience “screen apnea” when checking their emails: they become so caught up in the endless notifications that they forget to breathe properly. “Your fight or flight system becomes up-regulated, because you’re constantly trying to stay on top of things,” she says, and this hypervigilance has cognitive costs: it makes us more forgetful, worse at making decisions and less attentive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Inside Saturday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

After all, what matters to tech companies financially is not that you want to be reading what you’re reading, or that you love what you listen to or what you’re looking at, only that you are unwilling or unable to pull yourself away. This is why streaming services such as Netflix crank out bland, formulaic films that are euphemistically labelled “casual viewing” and are literally designed for viewers &lt;a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;who aren’t really watching&lt;/a&gt;, and Spotify playlists are filled with &lt;a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;generic stock music&lt;/a&gt; by fake artists, to provide background music, “Chill Out” or “Party” vibes, for listeners who aren’t really listening. In short, the modern internet doesn’t necessarily make you an idiot, but it definitely primes you to act like one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t is into this climate that generative AI arrived, with an entirely novel offer. Until recently you could only outsource remembering and some data processing to technology; now you can outsource thinking itself. Given that we spend most of our lives feeling overstimulated and frazzled, it’s little wonder that so many have jumped at the chance to let a computer do more things we would have once done for ourselves– such as write work reports or emails, or plan a holiday. As we transition from the internet era to the AI era, what we’re consuming is not only ever more low-value, ultra-processed information, but more information that is essentially predigested, delivered in a way that is designed to bypass important human functions, such as assessing, filtering and summarising information, or actually considering a problem rather than finessing the first solution presented to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michael Gerlich, head of the Centre for Strategic Corporate Foresight and Sustainability at SBS Swiss Business School, began studying the impact of generative AI on critical thinking because he noticed the quality of classroom discussions decline. Sometimes he’d set his students a group exercise, and rather than talk to one another they continued to sit in silence, consulting their laptops. He spoke to other lecturers, who had noticed something similar. Gerlich recently conducted a study, involving 666 people of various ages, and found those who used AI more frequently &lt;a href="https://download.ssrn.com/2025/1/4/5082524.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKT%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQCmRbALQalkGRB3jehFvi8nWZYpU%2BYsnAEPxO%2BoBB3wfQIhANrBGQfOPSK1dN8whuYILYNDsxhGw%2Bwlhc2H60tAdzgIKr0FCB0QBBoMMzA4NDc1MzAxMjU3IgzIZwV6noZaCGBCVVgqmgX8DsiB0tO6Adb6CtCDPG%2BnQuA6DxEy0Z2ot1NJ2g2bvGSRRq45nuWOo55d55Pz5bq%2F2M5wU2wtGpw5wlb6CD9YvJ5RgiQGq3YyIkesQhcbzGWlfVuSdjgcbsDcWtTaLR1%2FCalN8Qv2qhaW%2FrHHuHpjQyYMVXjtb2IPyLmswLY2CPhkWGTiqPlpkCubG2OmeQkyPABjnsk4wPNsu1YQF8bRjglekBXqg3n6osewqzYFUTnkMjtzN%2Ff4LnScCLPqmUZujjlUMxR3lwy8TfqsgVGYJ7hnrrOJ4TSmwp%2FlUXMADWyKGsTl6M1m%2Fjjk725o2M7FQF1QVC%2BWdr4cbvYt07ZydSFlMsGOAD8BoK98ngz7AZx92KjzmEqXkNewaMMlLeKCxUj63VkBBBBbCqPm3HnjU9IX1DQccbCyyT1oBWJXx6fE%2FZHR87Ch3W37DlLrvpoATKzuFIcj6uVsw1y4SS3C9sbdadKKuIQmJq5UpJI%2FL8n%2Fhl2wEPI8INq%2BIF0AMJzea5sajvfxqKEwTpcCI%2BB1eBLhq7%2FcCcTOFTgKG2xCHSgQw0yyYvUYKiOg4WLpSLzTP%2B%2B2QYaSAo3DQ69YfTW4E%2Fyfub5uv%2BimLRlJY3GtSJI4%2F%2B202Poiky3aW8nRQcLqoCWs7dtmnQeAr6vGsV2LEd2uwdRQYXve7A7%2B1WtkcCrskewpY30QvFeJzVH4OXJXtdxDPWUzblSI8g4FeWb8fgWqyEwLwh6miJ1jWclzK2rsA8a5jr5i4noPlcyqDEMFy49K709tHkYqUxT8SQt1ksox35sTMMqGs8ANPHU8WvnLZ2tsPGwR15V98q9XG6X7U6f9zki0jOUys0%2BGUQ4TPKCBlMC%2BeQ0n6VmMvvPHUQRj5dJJLfeo4M4w3dOMxgY6sAEBzWuQ5bMH%2FMBg3a1NXRNmFhsyMCvI%2FoOPTxuCMwut7ECx2YbOwEm1S4gm2wJnBcCP8Qd31iHo5fUdO4dC%2BbB8jPxyh%2Fb5fpLJgHhiWmgZurM4ql8KNWP2jH9NLdxv%2BZi9x8MfXGMnTTYL43ceUvMzKQY8J%2FvxFvIAi2kT0CLsJUl%2FkPk723vqh%2FWIZrVfOn0A%2FBLIta2wTijg3itrnZYER8X%2BBSrcMHw8cAtHblhuxA%3D%3D&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20250911T204332Z&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAUPUUPRWEWUPPMNLX%2F20250911%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=dda7f43bea1f7f00507c51a611aa025ba9386abe173968804683fc1892469502&amp;amp;amp;abstractId=5082524" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scored lower on critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;. (As he notes, to date his work only provides evidence for a correlation between the two: it’s possible that people with lower critical thinking abilities are more likely to trust AI, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Are schools equipped to produce creative thinkers – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, AI-essay writing drones?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Like many researchers, Gerlich believes that, used in the right way, AI can make us cleverer and more creative – but the way most people use it produces bland, unimaginative, factually questionable work. One concern is the so-called “anchoring effect”. If you post a question to generative AI, the answer it gives you sets your brain on a certain mental path and makes you less likely to consider alternative approaches. “I always use the example: imagine a candle. Now, AI can help you improve the candle. It will be the brightest ever, burn the longest, be very cheap and amazing looking, but it will never develop to the lightbulb,” he says. To get from the candle to a lightbulb you need a human who is good at critical thinking, someone who might take a chaotic, unstructured, unpredictable approach to problem solving. When, as has happened in many workplaces, companies roll out tools such as the chatbot Copilot without offering decent AI training, they risk producing teams of passable candle-makers in a world that demands high-efficiency lightbulbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also the bigger issue that adults who use AI as a shortcut have at least benefited from going through the education system in the years before it was possible to get a computer to write your homework for you. One &lt;a href="https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HEPI-Kortext-Student-Generative-AI-Survey-2025.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent British survey&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HEPI-Kortext-Student-Generative-AI-Survey-2025.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;92% of university students&lt;/a&gt; use AI, and about 20% have used AI to write all or part of an assignment for them. Under these circumstances, how much are they learning? Are schools and universities still equipped to produce creative, original thinkers who will build better, more intelligent societies – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome years ago, Matt Miles, a psychology teacher at a high school in Virginia in the US, was sent on a training programme on tech in schools. The teachers were shown a video in which a schoolgirl is caught checking her phone during lessons. In the video, she looks up and says, “You think I’m just on TikTok or playing games. I’m actually in a research room talking to a water researcher from Botswana for a project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s laughable. You show it to the kids and they all laugh, right?” Miles says. Alarmed at the disconnect between how policymakers view tech in education and what teachers were seeing in the classroom, in 2017 Miles and his colleague Joe Clement, who teaches economics and government at the same school, published &lt;a href="https://screenschooled.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Screen Schooled&lt;/a&gt;, a book that argued that technology overuse is making kids dumber. In the years since, smartphones have been banned from their classrooms, but students still work from their laptops. “We had one kid tell us, and I think it was pretty insightful, ‘If you see me on my phone, there’s a 0% chance I’m doing something productive. If you see me on my laptop, there’s a 50% chance,’” Miles says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;In essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Until the pandemic, many teachers were “rightly sceptical” about the benefits of introducing more technology into the classroom, Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado, observes, but when lockdowns forced schools to go online, a new normal was created, and ed tech platforms such as Google Workspace for Education, Kahoot! and Zearn became ubiquitous. With the spread of generative AI came new promises that it could revolutionise education and usher in an era of personalised student learning, while also reducing the workload for teachers. But almost all the research that has found benefits to introducing tech in classrooms is funded by the ed-tech industry, and most large-scale independent research has found that screen time gets in the way of achievement. A global OECD study found, for instance, that the more students use tech in schools, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34174796" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the worse their results&lt;/a&gt;. “There is simply no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools … in essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children,” says Wayne Holmes, a professor of critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London. “Most sensible people would not go into a bar and meet somebody who says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this new drug. It’s really good for you’ – and just use it. Generally, we expect our medicines to be rigorously tested, we expect them to be prescribed to us by professionals. But suddenly when we’re talking about ed tech, which apparently is very beneficial for children’s developing brains, we don’t need to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What worries Miles and Clement is not only that their students are permanently distracted by their devices, but that they will not develop critical thinking skills and deep knowledge when quick answers are only a click away. Where once Clement would ask his class a question such as, “Where do you think the US ranks in terms of GDP per capita?” and guide his students as they puzzled over the solution, now someone will have Googled the answer before he’s even finished his question. They know students use ChatGPT constantly and get annoyed if they aren’t provided with a digital copy of their assignment, because then they must type rather than copy and paste the relevant questions into an AI assistant or the Google search bar. “Being able to Google something and providing the right answer isn’t knowledge,” Clement says. “And having knowledge is incredibly important so that when you hear something that’s questionable or maybe fake, you think, ‘Wait a minute, that contradicts all the knowledge I have that says otherwise, right?’ It’s no wonder there’s a bunch of idiots walking about who think that the Earth is flat. Like, if you read a flat Earth blog, you think, ‘Ah, that makes a lot of sense’ because you don’t have any understanding or knowledge.” The internet is already awash with conspiracy and misinformation, something that will only become worse as AI hallucinates and produces plausible fakes, and he worries that young people are poorly equipped to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the pandemic, Miles says, he found his young son weeping over his school-issued tablet. His son was doing an online maths program and he had been tasked with making six using the fewest number of one, three and five tokens. He kept suggesting using two threes, and the computer kept telling him he was wrong. Miles tried one and five, which the computer accepted. “That’s kind of the nightmare you get with a non-human AI, right?” Miles observes: students often approach topics in unanticipated and interesting ways, but machines struggle to cope with idiosyncrasy. Listening to his story, however, I was struck by a different kind of nightmare. Maybe the dawn of the new golden era of stupidity doesn’t begin when we submit to super-intelligent machines; it starts when we hand over power to dumb ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 13:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOaTlPNEh0NjJmNGVtcDUyWEJhbVZSazk1MGpMbXpFc25PTl9vZ1VBdk11a09yRnlyZXMxTEYyMmtWM1hhNEpseDRvcFNHbk5Za2lFdWh3emZyLVl4dm1rNTg5cjBJcElRMEZCaU12ZUJOQWdtcFdKWXlsakthNkJRa3E5cWpKbENXaTI0R2hpNUpTcXROTHZIb09UWlBtb1plUUtJaVVFYw</guid></item><item><title>音乐可以帮助缓解手术或疾病带来的疼痛。科学家正在倾听-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/music-pain-research-healing-surgery-medicine-495a90c22ca196da0e95ffe515fb4cbd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Rod Salaysay works with all kinds of instruments in the hospital: a thermometer, a stethoscope and sometimes his guitar and ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nonopioid-painkiller-fda-vertex-pharmaceuticals-b1dd4276fce3d88ff32e3062e95f408f"&gt;pain after surgery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Along with medications, he offers &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/895c5b00f554466894d1d50a851ef5ec"&gt;tunes on request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often smile or nod along. Salaysay even sees changes in their vital signs like lower heart rate and blood pressure, and some may request fewer painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s often a cycle of worry, pain, anxiety in a hospital,” he said, “but you can help break that cycle with music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salaysay is a one-man band, but he’s not alone. Over the past two decades, live performances and recorded music have flowed into hospitals and doctors’ offices as research grows on how songs can help ease pain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Scientists explore how music affects pain perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/c75e6a1185024a7c8892dacf56e6e308#"&gt;healing power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of song may sound intuitive given music’s deep roots in human culture. But the science of whether and how music dulls acute and chronic pain — technically called music-induced analgesia — is just catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2025/08000/individualizing_musical_tempo_to_spontaneous_rates.11.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72882-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person’s ability to tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What seems to matter most is that patients — or their families — choose the music selections themselves and listen intently, not just as background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How music can affect pain levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain is a really complex experience,” said Adam Hanley, a psychologist at Florida State University. “It’s created by a physical sensation, and by our thoughts about that sensation and emotional reaction to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body — like a hand touching a hot stove — send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain is interpreted and translated by the brain,” which may ratchet the signal up or down, said Dr. Gilbert Chandler, a specialist in chronic spinal pain at the Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers know music can draw attention away from pain, lessening the sensation. But studies also suggest that listening to preferred music helps dull pain more than listening to podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music is a distractor. It draws your focus away from the pain. But it’s doing more than that,” said Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at McGill University who studies music and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,” said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. “That changes the perception and experience of pain — and the isolation and anxiety of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Music genres and active listening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of using recorded music to lessen pain associated with dental surgery began in the late 19th century before local anesthetics were available. Today researchers are studying what conditions make music most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands conducted a study on 548 participants to see how listening to five &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72882-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genres of music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — classical, rock, pop, urban and electronic — extended their ability to withstand acute pain, as measured by exposure to very cold temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All music helped, but there was no single winning genre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more people listened to a favorite genre, the more they could endure pain,” said co-author Dr. Emy van der Valk Bouman. “A lot of people thought that classical music would help them more. Actually, we are finding more evidence that what’s best is just the music you like.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The exact reasons are still unclear, but it may be because familiar songs activate more memories and emotions, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple act of choosing is itself powerful, said Claire Howlin, director of the Music and Health Psychology Lab at Trinity College Dublin, who co-authored a study that suggested &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72882-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;allowing patients to select songs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; improved their pain tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing that people can have control over if they have a chronic condition — it gives them agency,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active, focused listening also seems to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanley, the Florida State psychologist, co-authored a preliminary study suggesting &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40225443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;daily attentive listening&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; might reduce chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music has a way of lighting up different parts of the brain,” he said, “so you’re giving people this positive emotional bump that takes their mind away from the pain.” &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple prescription with no side effects, some doctors now say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecily Gardner, a jazz singer in Culver City, California, said she used music to help get through a serious illness and has sung to friends battling pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music reduces stress, fosters community,” she said, “and just transports you to a better place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

And the chemical greeting they are extending to the bloodsuckers is more lethal than convivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;David Heaton, spokesperson for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, said the inhospitable welcome is necessary because mosquitoes are known to carry a legion of tropical diseases. Fortunately, he added, there are no known human cases of such ailments in Washington County this year, though one pool of Aedes aegypti tested positive for West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We don’t have any of those diseases for these mosquitoes to spread, and hopefully none will be imported into [the area],” Heaton said. “But there is always that potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have cropped up in Santa Clara, St. George, Washington City, Hurricane and Springdale neighborhoods over the past few weeks after several storms dumped monsoonal moisture on the drought-prone area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;While the water has been welcomed, the mosquitoes are not. Neither are the large red welts that residents who have been bitten by the bugs sport on their wrists, ankles and other thin-skinned areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“I’ve heard some people with the bites have gone to the hospital to find out what is going on,” said Sean Amodt, manager of the Southwest Mosquito Abatement District. “They didn’t know what was causing it or how to deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stealth flyers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Frequently mislabeled as “no-see-ums,” the pests tend to fly low and evade human detection, according to Amodt. He said people often don’t know they have been bitten until the welts and bruises emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In recent weeks, district abatement teams have responded to 40 requests from people pleading with them to exterminate the mosquitoes infesting their yards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“The statement we constantly hear from them is, ‘Help, we are getting eaten alive,’” Amodt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Killing the mosquitoes is easier than finding them. Often, abatement workers who respond to a complaint will have to comb an entire neighborhood to find the source of the infestation. To alert residents in an infested area about the problem, Amodt’s workers pass out public health pamphlets, directing them to remove clutter and standing water in their yards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were first detected and summarily dispatched in Washington County in 2013, in the Harrisburg area near Leeds, according to the district manager. Seven years later, they resurfaced in a St. George yard, and they have been showing up in more neighborhoods and in greater numbers over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Amodt said the mosquitoes, which are identifiable by the lyre-like mark on their upper thorax and black and white bandings on their legs, are believed to have infiltrated the area from the larvae in the potting soils and mulch from infected areas that are sold at local hardware and other stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Often labeled urban mosquitoes, he explained, their larvae are typically found in birdbaths, plant pots, tires, under rocks in decorative ponds, even bottle caps — all places where water can accumulate. Adult females typically lay eggs on the side of containers, where they hatch once the water level rises. The life cycle for the mosquitoes ranges from two to four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In that time, though, the adult females — the ones that do the biting — can wreak havoc. For starters, they bite during the day rather than just in the morning or evenings. And they are voracious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“Adult females can bite someone up to twelve times for one blood meal, which is used to secure the protein needed to develop their eggs,” Amodt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Abatement crews use spray or foggers to rid areas of adult mosquitoes. They also dump out water pooled in containers and treat water where larva is found. Despite their best efforts, abatement officials concede, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes’ range has expanded to Washington County–at least from May through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;County residents who need relief from the pests can call 435-627-0076 or fill out a service request on the &lt;a href="https://www.swmosquito.org/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;district’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 12:02:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE90cThkWUx0NVJIdmlPUEJZUi1LRGlEMF9HbFM2LVQ5dzRYbGRqUkVrTFR5RE4tZHQyRFVUOHFuMzZXNnd5bHY5eHFaN0c3YS1BWFdwSkRsRWF5OThKWTNVeEhyLWNZOWNzOUtUWTJmZXlEeHpUb2dRMVRpZ3dDcm8</guid></item><item><title>男性大脑比女性大脑收缩得更快，研究结果- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/male-brains-shrink-faster-than-female-brains-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New evidence has found that male brains really may shrink faster than female brains with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 4,726 participants with healthy cognition, brain scans have revealed "modest yet systematic sex differences" in how neurological tissue wastes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archneur.60.7.989"&gt;naturally shrinks&lt;/a&gt; as we get older, and those who die with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="177626" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease have brains that &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease"&gt;show drastic volume losses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03564-3"&gt;twice the rate of men&lt;/a&gt;, but surprisingly little is known about how a person's sex impacts their brain volume as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the female brain may actually lose &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; at a slower rate than the male brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Men And Women May Respond Differently to Latest Alzheimer's Drugs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If women's brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer's prevalence," co-author Anne Ravndal, a neuroscientist at the University of Oslo in Norway, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03353-5"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; journalist Rachel Fieldhous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ravndal and an international team of researchers pulled together more than 12,000 brain scans, collected over the years from participants aged 17 to 95. Each individual had at least two brain MRIs, with an average interval of about 3 years between them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After controlling for sex-based differences in brain size, the team found that men showed a decline in a greater number of brain regions, including many parts of the cortex, in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, women showed a decline in fewer regions, and the thickness of their cortex was less altered with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that there are real sex differences in the biology of aging, but the results should be interpreted with caution, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510486122"&gt;the authors note&lt;/a&gt;, as far more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177643" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-642x495.png" alt="Age Differences Between Sexes" class="size-medium wp-image-177643" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-642x495.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-875x675.png 875w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-768x593.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-1536x1185.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging-600x463.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SexDifferencesAging.png 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177643" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Differences between male and female participants in the study.

Today, it remains unclear whether men and women differ in the extent or speed of brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show steeper declines in gray and white matter &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2019.05.020"&gt;among men&lt;/a&gt;, while others show steeper declines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0114478"&gt;among women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, led by researchers at the University of Oslo in Norway, sought to clear up the picture. Between the sexes, researchers found sex-based differences in total brain volume, subcortical brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area, among dozens of other measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these losses mean for cognitive function requires further research. Scientists are only just starting to understand how brain shape is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-of-future-dementia-may-be-hidden-in-the-shape-of-your-brain"&gt;linked to disease&lt;/a&gt;, and some studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-alzheimers-drug-shrinks-the-brain-scientists-say-thats-the-point"&gt;suggest that shrinkage&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of volume loss can certainly give important clues. &lt;span&gt;Surprisingly, Ravndal and colleagues found no difference in volume changes to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;– a neural hub for memory and learning closely involved in dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only in older age did women in the study begin to show a faster decline in the hippocampus, once their relative life expectancy was taken into account. But this may simply be a delay in aging: a product of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-humans-females-outlive-males-in-other-mammals-too"&gt;women living longer&lt;/a&gt; than men and not necessarily a sign that explains their dementia risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the authors compared men and women who were predicted to live the same amount, some of the brain decline between the sexes balanced out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teasing apart the impact of sex on the brain from other genetic and environmental forces is tricky business, made all the more challenging by a lack of longitudinal research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 review argued that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grave-consequences-scientists-warn-of-extreme-bias-in-brain-aging-research"&gt;continued scientific bias&lt;/a&gt; in brain aging studies has "grave consequences" for wellbeing and places a "disproportionate burden" on female health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on the aging female brain is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510486122"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;PNAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Marissa Coreno was embracing a new life in 2021. She had just moved out of her parents' house and was spending more time in the gym. She liked her job at a hospital in Ohio. Everything seemed to be going great — until she found a lump in her armpit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coreno wasn't particularly concerned at first. She was 27 and had no family history of cancer. But her colleagues thought she shouldn't ignore it. An ultrasound found "questionable characteristics." That was followed by a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mammograms-breast-cancer-screening-questions-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mammogram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, then a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, Coreno was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. She said she felt like her world had been turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was devastating. It took a while to process. I knew it was positive, and I knew I had breast cancer but in my head, it was like 'No way,'" Coreno said. "You hear about these cases and you see them on TV but it was hard to believe that this was now my life." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An increase in young diagnoses &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in U.S. women aged 20 to 49, and the incidence rate of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elissa-kalver-her2-positive-metastatic-breast-cancer-memorial-sloan-kettering-ucla/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in women under 50 has risen faster than in women over 50, &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-young-women/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been a physician for over 25 years. When I first started practicing, we saw women in their 40s and now we're seeing the late 20s and early 30s more commonly," said Dr. Mary Gemignani, the director of the Women's Early Onset Cancer Program and chief of the Division of Breast Surgery at NYU Langone, who was not involved in Coreno's care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, breast cancer diagnoses in women as young as Coreno are rare. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2024/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; estimates that only about 1 in 1,344 women will develop breast cancer in their 20s. Younger patients are unlikely to have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-explains-why-mammograms-should-start-at-age-40/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;regular screenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Gemignani said, since most women &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-awareness-month-early-screening-diagnosis-northwestern-university/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;do not receive mammograms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; until they are 40. Younger women also tend to have "more aggressive" tumors or be diagnosed with rarer disease subtypes, Gemignani said. There is no &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-increase-reasons/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;proven reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the increase, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemignani said younger women tend to have unique needs, including fertility concerns, which make it important for them and their doctors to develop a personalized &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olivia-munn-breast-cancer-story-test-inside-edition-correspondent-alison-hall/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;treatment plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Coreno said she found few research studies that looked at outcomes for her age group but spoke candidly with Dr. Baidehi Maiti, a medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, about her best options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being so young and not having a lot of research or studies or proof out there, every option I had along the way, I chose the most," Coreno said. "I was very protective." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Connection amid "exhausting" chemotherapy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coreno's treatment started with four months of "exhausting" chemotherapy to stop her cancer from spreading any further. Her mom moved in to help take care of her, while her dad drove her to every appointment. Coreno said she lost her hair and could barely leave the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going from such an active life — I was in my prime, I was working out on the regular, I was so proud of what I had accomplished — to not even having enough energy to get off the couch was hard," Coreno said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one bright spot: One night, Coreno decided to "eat (her) feelings" and ordered Crumbl cookies. She posted a picture of the delivery on Instagram. She received a message about the sweet treat from Anthony, a former classmate. The two struck up a conversation and "just never stopped talking." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was so nice to talk to somebody, have somebody listen to me, have a new friend that I could confide in," Coreno said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the two went on a date. Coreno dreaded leaving the house and was self-conscious about wearing a wig but enjoyed herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He didn't even mention the wig. We just had a great time," Coreno said. "It just felt so natural." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After chemotherapy, Coreno underwent a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olivia-munn-breast-cancer-diagnosed/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;double mastectomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, followed by a reconstruction surgery and 25 days of radiation therapy, Maiti said. Coreno started hormone therapy in March 2022 and will continue it until 2032. She also has regular scans. The treatment stops her body from creating estrogen to limit the chance of the cancer returning. Coreno is currently cancer-free, Maiti said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She has not let cancer define her life," Maiti said. "She's thriving as a breast cancer survivor and living her life to the fullest." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Life is beautiful" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone therapy sent Coreno into menopause at 28. Working out is harder now, she said, and she grapples with hot flashes and has trouble sleeping. It has taken years for her to get used to the new normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought this would be the easy part," Coreno, now 31, said. "After treatment was over is when what I went through hit me the most." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the difficult adjustment, her relationship with Anthony turned more serious. They were married in August 2024 and spent their honeymoon in Italy. Over the summer, they celebrated their anniversary in Cancún, Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coreno also hopes that sharing her story encourages others to investigate any warning signs they experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just want everyone to realize that it seems like it will never be you, it seems like it's always going to be someone else, it seems like it's going to be a person on the TV, but it can happen to you," Coreno said. "If you feel uncertain about anything, you need to speak up and get checked out. If, for some reason, you don't get the best news, there is light at the end of the tunnel. It might not seem like it. It might seem like it's a very long tunnel. But life is beautiful afterwards." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Testosterone is to prostate cancer what fuel is to fire, so sometimes we administer these hormones. This can cause mood changes, fatigue, breast enlargement, breast tenderness, anger issues, brain fog, and potential long-term bone loss, similar to women in menopause. There’s also an associated risk of cardiac issues in the long term with hormone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;9. What can be done to alleviate the side effects?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have very large teams that help with these and there is a strong multidisciplinary approach. If someone has erectile issues, we can offer tablets, injections or vacuum pumps, or we can insert an inflatable cylinder into the penis – it’s rare but it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/causes-of-incontinence-how-manage-symptoms-support/"&gt;incontinence&lt;/a&gt;, most of the time normal function returns. We work on pelvic muscle training, and have pads, penile clamps, emotional support and counselling. We can implant an artificial sphincter, but robot surgery and aftercare is sufficiently advanced, meaning enough of the anatomy and nerve structure is preserved and very few people need the sphincter. Most of the time post-surgery, the first week is stormy, but within about three months, 70 per cent will regain control, and within 12 months most people are dry. Only 5 per cent have lasting issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faecal incontinence is more associated with radiotherapy and may require surgery – but this affects only 0.1 per cent. It’s extremely rare and it all improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hormone treatments, we can give drugs to prevent breast enlargement. If they are experiencing hot flushes, we can offer acupuncture. Exercise is very helpful in dealing with weight gain or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;10. Can people decide against treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose a 93-year-old man is diagnosed with prostate cancer – we put him on a watchful waiting pathway, where we do some tests and keep an eye on them. The PSA is a good marker once there is a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use doubling time. If someone has a PSA test in January and they have a PSA of four, and by March it’s eight, that is definitely something we need to investigate. We know overdiagnosis and overtreatment can be a problem and we do a lot of work to prevent that happening. If a patient doesn’t want any treatment, we will watch them and test them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;11. How do I know whether the treatment is working?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We monitor patients based on PSA levels, scans, and symptoms. We bring patients back to clinic, involve their GPs, and engage community nurses. Success rates are very high: 90-95 per cent for locally confined prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This depends on initial pathology, but if the cancer is confined to the prostate, we’re talking about a significant chance of complete cure. We’re seeing major improvements in survival data with modern treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;12. What is the effect on my fertility?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment will render you infertile. We routinely bank patients’ sperm – if they haven’t &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/parenting/fertility/"&gt;completed their family&lt;/a&gt;, we organise that the next day [after diagnosis], usually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;13. What are the chances of cancer coming back?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all depends on the treatment. Success rates are very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With surveillance alone, about 20-30 per cent of patients will need treatment in five years. With focal therapy, the recurrence rate is 20-40 per cent at five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With radiotherapy or surgery, it depends on the grade of cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-risk: Surgery – 5 per cent recurrence; radiotherapy – 5-20 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medium-risk: Surgery – 20 per cent; radiotherapy – 20-40 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-risk: Surgery – 50 per cent; radiotherapy – 50-70 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The new guidance stresses not just how much fibre, but what kind and quality of food is eaten. Among novel foods being recommended that are on the increase, kiwi fruit is noteworthy for its scientifically based gut-friendly benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The guidelines:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were developed through a comprehensive systematic review by dietitians and experts at King's college London, guidelines offer 59 practical recommendations focusing on specific foods, drinks, and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the guidelines emphasize the consumption of 2–3 kiwi fruits per day and the intake of high mineral-content water as effective dietary strategies for alleviating constipation symptoms. These approaches are grounded in scientific evidence and are considered more beneficial than generic high-fibre diets or the use of senna supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 30-gram fibre target set by BDA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BDA recommends that adults get about 30 grams of dietary fibre each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre increases the bulk and softness of stool, making it move through the intestines more easily. But fibre must be increased gradually to cause no discomfort, and always accompanied by proper hydration — about 2 litres of fluid daily. Water helps fibre swell and prevents stools from drying out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To achieve this goal, the BDA recommends a blend of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains: Oats, wholemeal bread, brown rice and cereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes and pulses: Consumption of lentils, chickpeas etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits and vegetables: Particularly those consumed with skin or seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds: Like chia, flax, and almonds for additional soluble fibre.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The kiwi connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latest nutritional surveys backed by the BDA and other British dietetic organizations highlight kiwi fruit as a natural, non-prescription remedy for constipation. New Zealand and U.K. research finds that two daily green kiwis can substantially boost stool frequency and softness within two to four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwi contains a special enzyme, named actinidin, which enhances the digestion by facilitating protein breakdown and an enhanced gut mobility. Kiwi also possesses soluble and insoluble fibre — a rare combination that ensures healthy stool formation without excessive gas or bloating. The high water content and vitamin C in kiwi also assist in hydration and soften stools naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike prunes, which act primarily through sorbitol (naturally occurring sugar alcohol that pulls water into the colon), kiwi provides a lower-sugar, less irritating mechanism that will be appropriate for individuals who find dried fruit causes discomfort or bloating. The BDA cites kiwi as an appropriate "functional food" for mild to moderate constipation, particularly in individuals looking for long-term, food-based control over symptoms and not short-term pharmaceutical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydration and meal rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water is the unobtrusive partner of every high-fibre diet. The BDA recommends retaining a minimum of 8–10 fluid cups per day — more when upping fibre.

and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/praluent" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;alirocumab&lt;/a&gt;,” Nordestgaard continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For &lt;em&gt;ANGPTL4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LPL&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;CETP&lt;/em&gt; no drugs have yet been approved but they have been or are being developed,” she added added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a scientific genetic analysis technique called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833605/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; to examine how either genetic variants or cholesterol-lowering drugs would influence a person’s dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the study’s conclusion, scientists found that reducing the amount of cholesterol in the blood by a very tiny amount — 1 millimole per liter — can reduce dementia risk by up to 80% for certain drug targets. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important [thing] about this finding is probably that since genes are with us from birth, this tells us something about how there probably is a potential for preventing a large proportion of dementia cases if prevention is started early in life,” Nordestgaard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A big problem with dementia as a disease is that we have very limited treatment options, and the few treatment options that are available do not cure the disease but simply halt the progression. Therefore, the largest potential for reducing the number of people who get dementia is in the prevention of the disease,” she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/g.-peter-gliebus/2730213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Peter Gliebus&lt;/a&gt;, MD, chief of neurology and director of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gliebus, who was not involved in the research, commented that the study provides compelling evidence that lowering &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/non-hdl-cholesterol-levels-how-to-lower-chart-and-more" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;non-HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; through specific drug targets may reduce the risk of all-cause dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is promising because it suggests that managing cholesterol levels earlier in life could have long-term benefits for brain health and potentially prevent dementia,” Gliebus explained. “It reinforces the importance of addressing cardiovascular risk factors not only for heart health but also for cognitive health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dementia is a devastating condition affecting millions globally, with significant personal, societal, and economic impacts,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite years of research, effective treatments and prevention strategies remain limited. Identifying modifiable risk factors, such as cholesterol levels, offers hope for reducing the prevalence of dementia. Exploring new prevention methods can help delay or prevent the onset of dementia, improving quality of life and reducing healthcare burdens,” said Gliebus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/yu-ming-ni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Yu-Ming Ni&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified cardiologist and lipidologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that the relationship between cholesterol and dementia is likely not direct — it’s likely something that is through multiple relationships,” Ni, who was not involved in the study, told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we do know that patients with higher cholesterol tend to develop more &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/high-cholesterol-early-in-life-can-predispose-to-atherosclerosis-in-adulthood" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cholesterol plaque&lt;/a&gt; buildup. And we know that cholesterol plaques in the brain can contribute to poor blood flow — with less blood flow to the brain, you’re going to have potentially greater problems with your memory,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, we’ve seen that high cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7624" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, which can affect your cognition. But it isn’t as clear whether lowering cholesterol consistently reduces your risk for dementia, or if it’s simply that lower levels of cholesterol are associated with less dementia. I think it’s more something where, as we study, it’s probably not just cholesterol that’s contributing to your cognition — it’s probably more things than that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Yu-Ming Ni, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So as we try to understand those risk factors, it can help to determine what therapies might be most effective to prevent dementia as people get older,” Ni added. “What would be helpful in the future is being able to really distinguish the different causes for dementia and for the different types of dementia. I think not everyone’s memory issues are the same, and the better we understand this, the better we can devise treatments for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 06:14:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNbTkyWS1McDFNZUQ2ZnhPYTR0QkRZcE9fWkphWUFjOVQ3amNMZTRjNUtUd3VZZHl2aU5KTkhzZDl1Mjhnd09IbVNsbGRWb1g2TWp2eGg0YUNpYzhpVEZDd19ZZDFtMUhZdzVhOG9mbkJPb3ZmZ3NMa01wcTBRWENBcw</guid></item><item><title>Essex MUM （英国广播公司）表示，肠癌体征并不总是适合勾选列表</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8z03kg546o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Bowel cancer signs do not always fit a tick list, says mum&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/998a/live/2eb25e70-aa81-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Paul Seager A smiling woman with shoulder length brown hair looks to camera.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol affects about 10% of U.S. adults; having it puts you at a higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When it comes to managing high cholesterol, small dietary changes can help. Eating enough vegetables not only helps reduce high cholesterol but may even prevent the condition. While many people believe that fresh veggies are healthiest, frozen veggies with no added ingredients can be just as nutritious. Plus, they tend to be budget-friendly and have a much longer shelf life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spoke with registered dietitians and dove into the latest research to share the seven best frozen vegetables for lower cholesterol.

The liver then uses cholesterol to create new bile, thus lowering blood cholesterol levels,” explains &lt;a href="https://feedyourintention.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stephanie Dunne, M.S., RDN, IFNCP&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative registered dietitian nutritionist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame is also a source of isoflavones, compounds in soy products that may help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green peas have 7 grams of cholesterol-lowering fiber per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, they’re another &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based source of protein&lt;/a&gt;, with 8 grams of protein per cup.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Higher intake of plant-based proteins has been shown to be helpful with cholesterol as they are often lower in saturated fats,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutrition educator. In other words, replacing some animal proteins—like beef, sausage, bacon and deli meat—with peas can help lower your total saturated fat intake. Consuming too much saturated fat is associated with high levels of LDL cholesterol, which is the harmful type of cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kolesa recommends tossing frozen green peas into pasta dishes, casseroles, stir-fries and soups or serving them as a side dish.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/spinach-benefits-11703396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt; is jam-packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to promote heart health. “Spinach is high in insoluble fiber and can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels. As a plant-based source of iron and protein, it’s also a great source of calcium, vitamin C and various antioxidants to help you stay healthy,” says &lt;a href="https://thepolishdietitian.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Daria Zajac, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian specializing in diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This leafy green is also high in antioxidants, particularly one of them. “Spinach is rich in a compound called lutein, an antioxidant known to help reduce inflammation. Research suggests that lutein may help cholesterol oxidation, which may help prevent cholesterol from sticking to artery walls,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vandanasheth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based and diabetes expert.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies suggest that eating more dark leafy greens like spinach is linked with lower rates of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Zajac recommends adding spinach to stews, soups or your morning eggs. It also goes great in your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899857/spinach-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-cauliflower-good-for-you-8608382" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; is another frozen veggie worth stocking up on. &lt;a href="https://heidimcindoord.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heidi McIndoo, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian focusing on budget-friendly nutrition, recommends it for its heart-healthy fiber and lack of saturated fat. Each cup of frozen cauliflower has 3 grams of fiber—about 10% of the Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's delicious roasted with just a little olive oil and kosher salt, or fancy it up with a drizzle of Buffalo sauce before popping into the oven," says McIndoo. "You can also puree it after steaming it to turn it into a perfect substitute for some or all of the cream in cream-based soups and sauces like potato soup or fettuccini Alfredo.” If you like McIndoo’s suggestion, you'll want to try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7870653/roasted-buffalo-cauliflower/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Buffalo Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; version.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like the other veggies on this list, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-benefits-8653215" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli is rich in fiber and micronutrients&lt;/a&gt;. What makes it stand out is its glucosinolate content, particularly sulforaphane. This is a phytochemical found almost exclusively in cruciferous veggies like broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research suggests that sulforaphane may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, both key factors that support heart health,” says Sheth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One small study found that eating about 1 cup of broccoli per day improved HDL cholesterol—the beneficial type of cholesterol—by 7.6% in female participants. In male participants, it reduced their total cholesterol by 10%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each cup of Brussels sprouts has 2 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, the kind that’s especially helpful for lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brussels-sprouts-health-benefits-8650195" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Brussels sprouts&lt;/a&gt; are also rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals that could provide more cholesterol-related benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brussels sprouts contain plant compounds, including kaempferol, which has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Kaempferol has been linked to promoting heart health and lowering cholesterol levels,” says Sheth.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These earthy veggies are easy to toss into pasta dishes, add to pizza or sauté on their own. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/9583/5-amazing-health-benefits-of-mushrooms/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mushrooms have unique benefits&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Mushrooms contain beta-glucans, a type of soluble fiber known to help reduce cholesterol by binding to cholesterol-rich bile acids and removing them from the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutrition writer. “Some studies suggest that certain varieties, like shiitake mushrooms, contain compounds that can further enhance cholesterol metabolism and promote heart health."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides adding these frozen veggies to your diet, there are a few other ways to improve cholesterol:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate Regular Physical Activity.&lt;/strong&gt; Ideally, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But informal movement also counts, so try &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-add-movement-limited-time-11772724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moving more throughout the day&lt;/a&gt;. This involves being intentional with looking for opportunities to move more—like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, incorporating movement breaks every hour—especially if you sit most of the day—and using a stand-up desk and walking pad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Mindful of Your Saturated Fat Intake.&lt;/strong&gt; This type of fat, found in foods like red and processed meats, baked goods, butter and full-fat dairy, can increase cholesterol levels if eaten excessively. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, a healthcare provider may recommend less if you have heart disease or high cholesterol, so make sure to check in with them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Your Alcohol Consumption.&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking too much alcohol can raise cholesterol, so be mindful of your total alcohol intake. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that women shouldn’t have more than one drink per day and men shouldn’t exceed two drinks daily—though some experts advise limiting it to less than these amounts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol-8773934" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cut back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, try a tasty mocktail, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883572/elderberry-elixir-mocktail/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Elderberry Elixir Mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7919850/moscow-mule-mocktail/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Moscow Mule Mocktail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/no-added-sugar-sangria-mocktail-11769655" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;No-Added-Sugar Sangria Mocktail&lt;/a&gt; (trust us, you won't miss the alcohol!).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plain frozen veggies are just as nutritious as fresh ones (plain being ones without added ingredients and sauces). Plus, they tend to cost less and don’t go bad after a few days, so stock up on frozen veggies. If you’re managing high cholesterol, we invite you to make room for these seven especially. They’re full of fiber, antioxidants and plant compounds that can help lower cholesterol and protect heart health. Plus, they go well in everything from smoothies to casseroles to pasta dishes and more.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — A groundbreaking study reveals that more than 99% of people who suffered cardiac events like heart attacks or strokes already had "nonoptimal" levels of at least one common risk factor, highlighting the critical importance of monitoring cardiovascular health indicators.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;this fall in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, analyzed medical records of nearly 7,000 U.S. adults and 9 million people from South Korea over more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that most cardiac events don't strike by complete surprise. Four precursors — high blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and smoking — at high levels, went unaddressed before patients experienced heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The more of these risk factors you gather along the pathway of life, the greater your risk later in life of having a heart attack," said &lt;a href="https://www.swedish.org/doctors/cardiology/wa/seattle/sarah-speck-1720003973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Dr. Sarah Speck&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and medical director of cardiac rehabilitation at Providence Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A preventable crisis&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Holm's experience illustrates the study's findings. Diagnosed with a genetic condition causing very high cholesterol levels in his 20s, the fit athlete who played volleyball for the University of Toronto initially ignored the warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had had a lifetime of very severe heart disease, which I had mostly ignored and neglected," Holm said. "I was just checked out. I tuned out. I didn't go to a doctor for like 20 years."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Holm felt his chest clench during workouts. Then one day in 2018, while swimming in Lake Sammamish, he felt the symptoms again.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It happened in the water and I couldn't reset. And so I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to drown," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this incident, Holm said he saw a doctor. Tests revealed he needed quintuple bypass surgery due to a blockage in his heart. He was only 46 years old at the time. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's the thing about heart disease is oftentimes it doesn't present. You have people that have issues and they look great. They exercise all the time," Holm said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prevention within reach&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speck emphasized that the first step to prevention is knowing your numbers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Know what your cholesterol is, know what your blood pressure is, know what your blood sugar is. These are simple tests that any physician can perform for you," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that 80% of heart disease is under our control. Speck recommends a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish, quitting smoking, and being active for even 20 minutes every day to promote a healthier, longer life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Holm, medication has brought his cholesterol to healthy levels. He now encourages others facing similar health challenges to seek each other for support.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seek out people who've had this similar experience," Speck advised. "So find a way to talk to someone who's been through what you're going through, because...you don't have to be alone."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Is it an achievable goal to remain mentally sharp while aging, or is it a pipe dream?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's entirely possible if you cultivate habits throughout your life that are beneficial to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher in cognitive neuroscience and the neuropsychology of aging processes, I aim to shed light on the ways we can maintain good cognitive health while aging in light of recent scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The importance of cognitive reserve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective strategies research has identified is developing and maintaining good cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve refers to the brain's ability to resist the effects of aging or neurodegenerative diseases without resulting in significant functional decline. This concept is now central to approaches for preventing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dementia prevention, intervention, and care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, updated in 2024, the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; highlighted the fact that 45 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 modifiable risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors include physical inactivity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="177929" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one of the earliest and most significant factors is having a low level of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education has long been considered the main indicator of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617702813248"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;. It reflects prolonged exposure to intellectually stimulating activities that promote the development of effective brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this view is now considered incomplete. Cognitive reserve is not fixed in childhood or adulthood: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.219"&gt;it can be built, maintained and even amplified throughout life&lt;/a&gt; through different experiences including learning, rich social interactions and cognitively stimulating leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific examples of these activities include playing a musical instrument or complex board games such as chess, or participating in volunteer activities that require planning and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding cognitive reserve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research offers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1684/nrp.2016.0394"&gt;several complementary models&lt;/a&gt; for understanding the mechanisms of cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some focus on the structure of the brain itself, suggesting that characteristics such as the number of neurons influence the brain's tolerance to damage. This is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0894-4105.7.3.273"&gt;brain reserve model&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the idea that some people are born with a greater number of neurons, enabling them to cope better with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others argue that active lifestyles can slow down the effects of brain aging by strengthening biological resilience — for example, the brain's ability to remain intact and functional as it ages, showing few visible signs of deterioration despite age. This is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2012.04.005"&gt;brain maintenance model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third set of models emphasizes the functional flexibility of the brain, which allows it to mobilize its resources differently or recruit alternative neural networks to compensate for age-related losses. This is known as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.03.004"&gt;cognitive reserve model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These different models are part of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.219"&gt;common conceptual framework&lt;/a&gt; that distinguishes between brain reserve, brain maintenance and cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each model is based on a specific idea, but they are complementary and supported by empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive reserve model remains the most widely studied, particularly because of its link to modifiable factors such as level of education and regular participation in cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177976" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177976" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderWomenPlayingChess-e1760653217648.jpg" alt="Older women playing chess" class="wp-image-177976 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177976" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Choosing leisure activities that require brain power can help us maintain cognitive health well into old age.

Above all, it reminds us that far from being a fixed entity, cognitive reserve evolves due to interactions with experience and learning, and can therefore be strengthened throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work supports this dynamic view. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458022002251?via%3Dihub"&gt;A team of Québec researchers, of which I am a member&lt;/a&gt;, has shown that structured learning of memory strategies, including the method of loci (associating each piece of information with a familiar place) or mental visualization (transforming information into images to better retain it), can induce significant changes in brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of increases and decreases in activation, including variations in the level of activity in different areas of the brain, was observed in different brain regions during the phases of learning and recalling information. This observation reflects the fact that the use of memory strategies allows for greater functional flexibility in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that in more educated individuals, certain regions are activated in a more targeted manner during learning and recall, suggesting that their brains use more effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research has also highlighted the role of education in brain structure and function. A study I conducted with colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9621-7"&gt;highlighted an association between years of schooling, volume of grey matter and brain activation in the context of memory&lt;/a&gt;. Another study in which I participated showed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2022.02.001"&gt;greater flexibility of activation according to task complexity in more educated individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this research confirms that cognitive reserve can be developed with experience and modulated by cognitive training at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulating your brain while having fun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, the Engage study by the &lt;a href="https://ccna-ccnv.ca"&gt;Canadian Consortium on Aging and Neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; aims to study the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of cognitively stimulating leisure activities in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hybrid intervention combines formal cognitive training (memorization strategies, attention) with structured leisure activities such as learning music, a second language or video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It offers an ecological model — in other words, an approach that is close to real-life conditions, enjoyable and motivating and conducive to sustained engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating that these natural interventions produce effects comparable to those of traditional cognitive training program, which often consist of repetitive exercises done on a computer or on paper to work on functions such as memory or concentration, Engage could transform approaches to preventing age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning another language&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my neuropsychology of aging laboratory (&lt;a href="http://www.uqtr.ca/neuropsychologieduvieillissement"&gt;NeuroÂge&lt;/a&gt;) at the University of Québec at Trois-Rivières (UQTR), we are conducting a complementary project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with professors Paul John, from the Department of Modern Languages and Translation, and Simon Rigoulot, from the Department of Psychology, we are exploring the effects of learning English as a second language on cognition and brain activity in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a protocol that integrates classes, tutoring and cognitive and electroencephalography measurements, this project aims to document the cognitive and neural benefits of meaningful, motivating and accessible learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results are promising and support the idea that intellectual engagement, even when started later in life, can generate measurable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining good cognitive health at any age requires a combination of accessible, motivating and stimulating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve, far from being fixed, is built up throughout life. Advances in research now offer us concrete tools for healthy aging, particularly when it comes to cognitive health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266451/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. It’s notoriously contagious — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;nine out of 10 unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; near someone with measles can become infected, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RQIOAX4PY5EPRIRQTWRXA3U7DM"&gt;Measles typically starts with symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. A few days later, a characteristic red rash breaks out, usually starting on the face and spreading downward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R3BJ7WHIIFAZREE6TFDX2BWFCQ"&gt;The disease can also lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and, in rare cases, death. According to the CDC, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;three confirmed measles-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EWZG4IPV3ZA4NOZLTZTQVJGVLU"&gt;Oregon health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/oregon-confirms-first-measles-case-of-2025-linked-to-international-travel.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/oregon-confirms-first-measles-case-of-2025-linked-to-international-travel.html"&gt;confirmed only one case of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far this year — an unvaccinated adult from Multnomah County who tested positive in June after returning from an overseas trip.

The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted," she remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's scary to think about that," Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But then came a staggering turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Why fatal overdoses have fallen so sharply&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Kayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Ly Jamaal Littlejohn poses in front of a police car" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Lt Jamaal Littlejohn watched his own sister deal with substance use disorder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history.

Drug dealers still go to prison in Fayetteville.

She's such a long way now from the days when she used prostitution to fund her fentanyl habit. As part of the LEAD process, her criminal record has been wiped. She recently graduated as a certified nurse assistant, and is now working in a residential home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's like the best thing ever. This is the longest time I've been clean," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Critical to Kayla's recovery has been treatment. She's been taking methadone for nearly a year when she tells her story to the BBC. "It's keeping me from going back," she believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Methadone and buprenorphine are medications used to treat opioid use disorder.  They stem cravings and stop painful withdrawal. Nationwide, treatment has played a role in puncturing the overdose fatality statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In North Carolina, it's been a game-changer: more than 30,000 people were enrolled in a programme in 2024, with numbers climbing in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'You're still playing Russian roulette, but your odds improve'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9846/live/0c239ac0-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel A worker sits behind a reception window at a clinic.

"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly," says Dr Morse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is harm reduction.  So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling.  Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether.  And in time, many will taper off their medication too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;The abstinence debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Mark Pless speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Not everyone thinks this is the right approach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic.

Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;A generational shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Testing drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Josh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Josh Stein speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;North Carolina Governor Josh Stein took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them," Stein reflects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the "abatement of the opioid epidemic". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative," says Governor Stein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Charlton Roberson speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Kayla credits Charlton Roberson, her mentor at North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, with being instrumental in her recovery&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;No one is complacent.

Today, reports are stacking up in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-lifestyle-changes-could-prevent-half-of-all-cancer-deaths/"&gt;younger adults&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors are trying to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rising-cancer-rates-in-young-adults-linked-to-accelerated-aging/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; starts in the small pouch off the large intestine, and it often hides until surgery for suspected appendicitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cancers vary in their biology – from appendiceal adenocarcinoma, which begins in the gland cells lining the appendix, to neuroendocrine tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in the digestive tract. Yet they share a troubling trend: the number of cases is steadily climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-appendix-cancer-the-numbers"&gt;Appendix cancer – the numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40489784/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found that cases of appendix cancer more than tripled among people born around 1980 and quadrupled among those born around 1985 when compared with people born in 1945. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included 4,858 adults, spanned 1975 to 2019, and tracked tumors by histologic subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers explained that people born after the 1970s, including Gen X and older Millennials, face roughly three times the risk of developing appendix cancer compared to those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They emphasized that this pattern held true across different tumor types and age ranges, suggesting that something has changed over time in the environment or lifestyle of newer generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the increase, they added, was far greater than they expected when the analysis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-the-trend"&gt;Tracking the trend&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used the National Cancer Institute’s &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SEER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program, a group of population based cancer registries that captures who gets cancer, when, and with what features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It routinely records tumor site, stage at diagnosis, treatments, and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared people by birth cohort, which means groups born in the same years, to see whether newer generations face higher risk at the same ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was clear across multiple tumor subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used five year age bands and 21 overlapping birth cohorts to reduce noise. Since rates rose after 1945 across successive cohorts, the results point away from a single explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helps separate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-could-happen-to-your-body-if-you-eat-just-one-hot-dog-processed-meat-each-day/"&gt;generational exposures&lt;/a&gt; from the simple effect of getting older. It is a way to tell whether something changed in the world that different generations share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-might-rates-be-rising"&gt;Why might rates be rising&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle, diet, and environmental changes began to abruptly shift in unexpected directions in 1970s and after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence links excess body weight, lower physical activity, alcohol, and high intake of red or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/western-diet-identified-as-major-cause-of-colon-cancer/"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt; with higher risk for colorectal cancer, which offers clues for the digestive tract more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics also came under the microscope. A recent antibiotics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953323/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; tied early life antibiotic exposure to higher odds of early onset colorectal cancer and precancerous polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings do not prove cause for appendix cancer, and the study authors were careful on that point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do hint that the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-stress-disrupts-gut-bacteria-and-fuels-cancer-progression/"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; may be part of the story because antibiotics can shift intestinal bacteria in lasting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also asking whether food processing and chemical exposures changed risk in ways we have not mapped yet. That work will need careful population data linked to biology rather than guesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-early-detection-is-tough"&gt;Why early detection is tough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no standard screening test for appendix cancer, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/colonoscopy-vs-stool-tests-doctors-found-out-which-is-better-at-detecting-cancer/"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, which is good at finding colon polyps, is not reliable for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms are often vague. People report intermittent abdominal pain, bloating, or a change in bowel habits that can look like many other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cases are found only after surgery for suspected appendicitis. The disease can spread inside the abdomen before it is noticed, which makes timing and treatment choices harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an appendix is removed, the tissue is examined under a microscope by a pathologist. That step confirms a diagnosis and helps guide the next move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-can-do-now"&gt;What you can do now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know your baseline health and pay attention to persistent abdominal symptoms that do not fit your usual pattern. If something lingers, talk with a clinician rather than waiting it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy habits still matter. The same risk factors that lift &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-plant-has-great-potential-to-fight-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk, like excess body weight and alcohol, are reasonable targets to reduce overall cancer burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of multiple cancers, ask about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-molecular-switch-revert-method-turns-cancer-cells-into-normal-cells/"&gt;inherited risk&lt;/a&gt; and whether specialized evaluation makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had appendicitis treated without surgery should also mention any ongoing abdominal symptoms at follow up visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple steps will not guarantee protection, but they can tilt the odds in your favor. Small, sustained changes add up over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-appendix-cancer-and-human-health"&gt;Appendix cancer and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians are separating appendix tumors from right-sided &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/colonoscopy-vs-stool-tests-doctors-found-out-which-is-better-at-detecting-cancer/"&gt;colon cancers&lt;/a&gt; in studies and registries so patterns do not get blurred. That clarity should lead to sharper trials and better guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency teams are also watching for appendicitis that fails to improve or that returns soon after treatment. When symptoms persist, closer follow up and imaging can speed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are updating how these tumors are coded and reported to avoid confusion with colon &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/protein-cd74-discovery-may-change-the-treatment-of-colon-cancer/"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Consistent naming helps researchers spot trends and design smarter trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health tools helped clarify this trend, but they cannot name the cause on their own. Next steps include lab work, exposure histories, and studies that connect biology with lived experience across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer generations face higher risks at the same ages as older groups did decades ago, which raises important questions for prevention and education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate task is to pay attention to symptoms, support research, and keep an open mind as evidence comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 23:27:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPZGo0R0Zscl9zOVhUUWsxcFJvNHJHVWtObkJHS0kwdTBBZVdiYXJzTzJLWG1fMVctdk9HNTQ3N05EYVlUMi16TWhMb2lDb095TVN4aUEzbmhLLWNRYnNtQnlJcGV5a2hnbVVldDNmUUNEd1RIajdzQmotRGI4NGV5T1hpdGc3enVrNXZic3lYM216Wm5LcHozdU53</guid></item><item><title>一项新研究刚刚揭示了便秘时应该食用的三种意想不到的东西-女性健康</title><link>https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a69074230/foods-for-constipation-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;div class="css-hl6xtf e1wzc3k51"&gt;&lt;img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/clock-regular.b2f2888.svg" alt="Estimated read time" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span class="css-deygkq e1wzc3k50"&gt;3 min read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;Recent research suggests new ways to beat &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993447/natural-laxatives/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993447/natural-laxatives/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="constipation" data-node-id="0.0.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; that don't involve following a generic high-fiber diet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Instead, the study singles out three diet additions you can make to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45523631/magnesium-for-constipation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45523631/magnesium-for-constipation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="get things moving again" data-node-id="0.1.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;get things moving again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;Here's what the researchers found, and why these three things should help you poop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="1" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When you're on day three of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993447/natural-laxatives/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993447/natural-laxatives/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="not going No. 2" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;not going No. 2&lt;/a&gt;, most people will do just about anything to get things moving again.

If you really want to get the most fiber from your kiwi, Cording says you can eat the fruit with the skin on, although “a lot of people find the texture off-putting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-rye-bread-help" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;How does rye bread help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Rye bread is a form of whole grain bread, Cording notes. “One-hundred percent whole rye has slightly more fiber than 100 percent whole wheat bread, and contains prebiotic fibers that help nourish beneficial gut bacteria," Gans says.  &lt;br data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Just keep in mind that this bread contains gluten. So, "if your constipation has to do with gluten intolerance, it probably won’t be helpful,” Cording says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-mineral-rich-water-help" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;How does mineral-rich water help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s a pretty big range of “mineral water” options out there, but the ones that contain magnesium and sulfates may be most helpful because the minerals can help draw water into the intestines and support smoother bowel movements, Gans says. "They may offer gentle relief for constipation, and since hydration is key for fiber to do its job, sipping mineral water can be a simple way to support digestive health," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Cording also points out: “Any water can be helpful for constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-generic-high-fiber-diets-not-be-the-key" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Why might generic high-fiber diets not be the key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s important to stress this: The researchers didn’t find that high-fiber diets were bad. They just discovered that there wasn’t enough data to suggest that following a &lt;em data-node-id="20.1"&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt; high-fiber diet is good for constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fiber is a really important piece of the picture, but fluid and movement can also be really supportive,” Cording says. “You can eat tons of fiber but, if you’re not having adequate fluids, it’s going to make things even worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;And remember that constipation's causes can be complicated, per Gans. "It’s  important to look at the bigger picture: Regular physical activity, stress levels, medications, and overall diet all play a role in keeping digestion on track," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, if you’re dealing with regular constipation and making dietary tweaks doesn’t seem to help, Cording says it’s a good idea to check in with a healthcare professional for an evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Scientists examined the insect's DNA on Sept. 17 and verified its identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is the first known detection of Ae. aegypti in the State of Idaho," Jim Lunders, the district's director, said, per CBS2 News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After the discovery, workers set up traps and monitoring equipment around the area. The search hasn't produced any more Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, but officials will keep checking the area into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This mosquito type breeds in artificial water holders and targets humans as its primary food source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are invasive mosquitoes concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The arrival of invasive mosquito species &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:threatens local ecosystems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;threatens local ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; by pushing out native insects that compete for the same resources. When non-native species move into new territory, they can disrupt food chains and spread diseases to which local populations have no resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Maintaining native species' safety helps balance natural systems. Native insects support local bird populations, preserve plant diversity, and help control pest numbers naturally. When invasive species take over, these benefits disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For people, the Aedes aegypti mosquito poses direct health risks. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, this species &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/facts/mosquito-factsheets/aedes-aegypti" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carries diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;carries diseases&lt;/a&gt; like dengue fever, Zika virus, and yellow fever. The mosquito bites during the day, making it harder to avoid than mosquitoes that only come out at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about invasive mosquitoes?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Local mosquito control teams are monitoring the situation closely. The Canyon County district has asked residents to check their properties for pooled water and drain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you own a home, drain containers like plant saucers, decorative fountains, and rain-blocked drains. Tiny amounts of pooled water create places for reproduction. These insects deposit eggs in amounts no bigger than a bottle cap holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wear insect repellent when spending time outside during the day. Long sleeves and pants add another layer of defense. Check that screens on windows and doors fit snugly without damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Contact your local mosquito control office if you notice mosquitoes biting during daylight hours. &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/take-local-action/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quick reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Quick reports&lt;/a&gt; allow authorities to map potential breeding zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rece7g7qwyRapsTHD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNR0h4dWsxR2hqbXphMFotcTJ2NVRRUmtlMVIxczVBQXM2QlZYX3RvU1U0b2NuQUVtMFJHNGN4dmJsNmFzcUFRNENQa1dfdGVBaThkVERhbGxnbnhMZXJYZENxSEdiTWlmelV3ZGtieVh5d01JX3BFd2ozSTFkcGppWkhVQnRZTExId09CTUROT2dIVjl6NFJXMg</guid></item></channel></rss>
