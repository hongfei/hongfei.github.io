&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to live a long and healthy life wants a magic formula for reaching a ripe old age. Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy ― but there are some things you can do to bolster your odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;″If you want to live longer, improve what you’re eating and start moving your body more,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/recipes/contributors/dr-linda-shiue" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7949949" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Linda Shiue&lt;/a&gt;, an internist and director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But knowing exactly which foods to eat for a longer life can be tricky. Shiue says that while no one needs to be perfect, it’s important to fill up on “foods in their natural state, like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and nuts.” By doing so, she said, we replace the “ultra-processed foods” in our diets, “such as shelf-stable foods that have refined carbs and high sugars, like white bread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even when we know which foods are good for us, it can be hard to figure out the right balance of healthy options that give us a better chance of living longer ― and hard to find sweets that are good for us when the craving strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked three top longevity experts what’s in their grocery carts. Here’s what they told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruciferous Vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;"razor-sharp" sore throat&lt;/a&gt;. Diarrhoea is also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Can I help make myself better? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images An array of tablets of varying colours" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;&lt;b id="paracetamol:" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Paracetamol: &lt;/b&gt;Provided you're okay to take it, this or ibuprofen is the first port of call.

    &lt;p&gt;President &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-autism-tylenol-medical-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Trump's suggestion last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was shocked," said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation "since the Andrew Wakefield days," referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;retracted as fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was "adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998," when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a return to a discredited strategy," Moss said. "Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age," he explained. "If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-thimerosal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/science-behind-vaccine-schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;spacing&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, now splitting MMR," he said. "Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;most contagious viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections," he said. "Undoing that progress would put children at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand — something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recycled claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself," she said. "And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine "contains fetal parts." In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mumps in particular, she said, "was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion," he said. "That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health," she said. "Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. "The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash," he said. "At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These claims aren't new; they're recycled," he said. "Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology," he said. "We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists," she said. "It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moss: "It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path."&lt;/p&gt;

                It's been hard for parents to get their kids COVID shots recently, as well as for many healthy adults, since the CDC hasn't weighed in with official guidelines for administering them.

   &lt;p&gt;Remy Sweeney-Garrett desperately wants to get her daughters vaccinated against COVID-19. But so far that's been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very worried, and frustrated," says Sweeney-Garrett, 34, who lives in Seattle with her 9-year-old daughter Maxine and 18-month-old daughter Maeve. "And, yeah, I'm angry."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett hasn't been able to get her daughters the shots because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to issue final guidelines for administering them. The rules are necessary for the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt; to start shipping the vaccines to doctors, health departments and others. About half of U.S. kids are eligible for shots through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm worried about my youngest daughter in particular having to go to the hospital because she is susceptible to respiratory complications," Sweeney-Garrett says. "And it's frustrating because I feel like this is within the control of the people in our government."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lag by the CDC is very unusual. Typically, the CDC acts within days – sometimes hours – because of the urgency of getting shots into arms before the winter surge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delay has created "a lot of confusion both among the public and even among providers around what the status is," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/communications/newsroom/2025/susan-kansagra-named-astho-cmo/" target="_blank"&gt;Susan Kansagra&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett is far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have parents asking every day for vaccines. They want the COVID vaccine," says Dr. Elias Kass, who's the Sweeney-Garrett family's doctor. "And we don't have it. And we don't have an ETA. We don't have anything. We don't want kids to be sick. We have the opportunity to prevent that suffering. And we as a society are blowing it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's delay has also forced adults seeking vaccination to continue navigating an often confusing and frustrating patchwork of state rules that have, in many places, made it difficult if not impossible for them to get vaccinated too. Even though many states have taken steps to make it easier for people to get the vaccines, some still require prescriptions and some pharmacists are still turning away people who can't document they meet new eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's a mess. And it's an easily avoidable mess," says &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "They chose not to take action. I think it will harm public health and the result will be more COVID-19 and more harm from it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's roll-out of the COVID vaccines has been unusually chaotic from the start. Until this year, anyone 6 months or older could get vaccinated by their pharmacist without a prescription. But for the first time this year, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the new shots&lt;/a&gt; for people at risk for serious complications because of their age or health,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt; causing widespread confusion and frustration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then the CDC's powerful &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, which Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. packed with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;like-minded anti-vaccine members, &lt;/a&gt;weighed in about the nuts and bolts of making them widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous two-day meeting last month, Kennedy's committee recommended adding&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt; a new hoop to getting vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, but also took steps that could &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540088/covid-vaccine-2025-cdc-fda-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;make more people eligible&lt;/a&gt;, let more pharmacists give the shots and start shipping the vaccines for kids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the CDC has yet to accept those recommendations— freezing everything in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a critical piece of enabling downstream access," says Kansagra of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "It's a huge problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And now with the government shut down, no one knows when the CDC might finally act or what the agency might do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Officials are especially worried because of the upcoming winter respiratory reason.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't know exactly how bad a season it could be, but it could certainly be very bad," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/people/philip-huang/" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Dallas Health and Human Services department in Texas. "It's very frustrating. Our jobs are being made harder rather than easier."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A 37-year-old woman’s bruising from a massage gun ended up having a cause stranger than anyone could have expected. In a recent report, doctors documented how the woman had developed the rare condition scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania detailed the bizarre turn of events in a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps2500075"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the New England Journal of Medicine as part of a regular segment highlighting medically complex cases. The woman’s bruising was only the first sign of worsening health issues that eventually landed her in the hospital. Fortunately, after several false leads, her clinicians correctly diagnosed the woman’s vitamin C deficiency, and she made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States…”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The wrong culprit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman visited the emergency room four days into having acute pain, swelling, and bruising on the upper portion of her left knee—symptoms that began after she used an electric massage gun on that area. She carried a genetic mutation that increased her general risk of blood clotting, which was managed with a blood thinner, and also had a long history of heavy menstrual bleeding. Anyone can potentially bruise or hurt themselves by applying too much pressure with a massage gun, though, and since initial tests didn’t find any other underlying reason for her symptoms, she was discharged and simply told to stop using the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, however, she visited the ER again, now with new symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath while exerting herself. She was then admitted to the hospital. The doctors suspected she had anemia caused by a lack of iron, and she was discharged with a prescription for iron pills and weekly IV infusions of iron.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Despite her treatment, her anemia and overall health continued to worsen, however. She visited the ER once more six weeks after her hospitalization with new chest pain, night sweats, and a sudden weight loss of 15 pounds. She now also had a high heart rate and low blood oxygen level, and soon enough, she was admitted to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Doctors determined she had developed pulmonary hypertension, a life-threatening type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and right side of the heart. But all of their tests continued to show no clear indication of what was causing her illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout all of this, her left leg continued to show bruising and swelling. And when doctors reexamined both legs, they found distinctive discolored spots and hairs curled up into a corkscrew shape. They also found she had developed “red-purple soft nodules” along her gums. Unlike her earlier, more general symptoms, these skin problems finally pointed to a very specific, if now rarely encountered, culprit: scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When questioned, the woman admitted that she had purposefully avoided eating anything containing citrus fruits years ago, following an episode of hives that she attributed to eating citrus. Testing failed to detect any vitamin C in her system, and she was immediately started on supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just two days into her new therapy, she was discharged from the ICU and eventually the hospital as well. Her health continued to steadily improve over the next few months, and follow-up testing showed that her heart issues had cleared up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rare but still around&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the widespread knowledge that we need regular doses of vitamin C from our diets, scurvy is no longer the fearsome threat it was centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even today, doctors do still occasionally see it. Some research has also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scurvy-is-making-a-surprising-comeback-2000509979'"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of scurvy in the U.S. has climbed lately, particularly among vulnerable groups like children with sensory issues, elderly people, and others struggling to eat or afford healthy fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This case was stranger than most, though, since pulmonary hypertension usually isn’t linked to scurvy. The authors note that the condition is often hard to diagnose at first because—as is with this case—the earliest signs tend to be non-specific symptoms potentially caused by many different things. So as rare as it is, the doctors hope their report can provide doctors a timely lesson that scurvy is still around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States and highlights its potential severity and clinical features,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                A new study found that artificial intelligence could design DNA for all kinds of dangerous proteins, and do it in such a way that DNA manufacturers' biosecurity screening measures would not reliably catch them.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Major biotech companies that churn out made-to-order DNA for scientists have protections in place to keep dangerous biological material out of the hands of would-be evil-doers. They screen their orders to catch anyone trying to buy, say, smallpox or anthrax genes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, a new &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has demonstrated how AI could be used to easily circumvent those biosafety processes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team of AI researchers found that protein-design tools could be used to "paraphrase" the DNA codes of toxic proteins, "re-writing them in ways that could preserve their structure, and potentially their function," says &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/horvitz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eric Horvitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The computer scientists used an AI program to generate DNA codes for more than 75,000 variants of hazardous proteins – and the firewalls used by DNA manufacturers weren't consistently able to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To our concern," says Horvitz, "these reformulated sequences slipped past the biosecurity screening systems used worldwide by DNA synthesis companies to flag dangerous orders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A fix quickly got written that and slapped onto the biosecurity screening software. But it's not perfect — it still wasn't able to detect a small fraction of the variants.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And it's just the latest episode showing how AI is revving up long-standing concerns about the potential misuse of powerful biological tools.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The perils of open science&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"AI-powered protein design is one of the most exciting frontiers in science. We're already seeing advances in medicine and public health," says Horvitz. "Yet like many powerful technologies, these same tools can often be misused."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, biologists have worried that their ever-improving DNA tools might be harnessed to design potent biothreats, like more virulent viruses or easy-to-spread toxins. They've even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/02/17/147053720/who-panel-supports-publication-of-bird-flu-details-eventually" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;debated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether it's really wise to openly publish certain experimental results, even though open discussion and independent replication has been the lifeblood of science.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The researchers and the journal who published this new study decided to hold some of their information back, and will restrict who gets access to their data and software. They enlisted a third party, a non-profit called the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, to make decisions about who has a legitimate need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the first time such a model has been employed to manage risks of sharing hazardous information in a scientific publication," says Horvitz.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists who have been worried about future biosecurity threats for some time praised this work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My overall reaction was favorable," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3126/arturo-casadevall" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arturo Casadevall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University. "Here we have a system in which we are identifying vulnerabilities. And what you're seeing is an attempt to correct the known vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The trouble is, says Casadevall, "what vulnerabilities don't we know about that will require future corrections?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that this team did not do any lab work to actually generate any of the proteins designed by AI, to see if they would truly mimic the activity of the biological original threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Such work would be an important reality check as society grapples with this kind of emerging threat from AI, says Casadevall, but would be tricky to do, as it might be precluded by international treaties prohibiting the development of biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting ahead of an AI "freight train"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time scientists have explored the potential for malevolent use of AI in a biological setting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a few years ago, another team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wondered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if AI could be used to generate novel molecules that would have the same properties as nerve agents. In less than six hours, the AI tool dutifully concocted 40,000 molecules that met the requested criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It not only came up with known chemical warfare agents like the notorious one called VX, but also designed many unknown molecules that looked plausible and were predicted to be more toxic. "We had transformed our innocuous generative model from a helpful tool of medicine to a generator of likely deadly molecules," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That team also didn't openly publish the chemical structures that the AI tool had devised, or create them in the lab, "because they thought they were way too dangerous," points out &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/david-relman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Relman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Stanford University. "They simply said, we're telling you all about this as a warning."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Relman thinks this latest study, showing how AI could be used to evade security screening and finding a way to address that, is laudable. At the same time, he says, it just illustrates that there's an enormous problem brewing. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it leaves us dangling and wondering, 'Well, what exactly are we supposed to do?'" he says. "How do we get ahead of a freight train that is just evermore accelerating and racing down the tracks, in danger of careening off the tracks?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns like these, some biosecurity experts see reasons to be reassured.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twist Bioscience is a major provider of made-to-order DNA, and in the past ten years, it's had to refer orders to law enforcement fewer than five times, says James Diggans, the head of policy and biosecurity at Twist Bioscience and chair of the board of directors at the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, an industry group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is an incredibly rare thing," he says. "In the cybersecurity world, you have a host of actors that are trying to access systems. That is not the case in biotech. The real number of people who are really trying to create misuse may be very close to zero. And so I think these systems are an important bulwark against that, but we should all find comfort in the fact that this is not a common scenario."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;America’s terrible year of measles is far from over. Several states have reported more cases of the vaccine-preventable viral disease as of late, while the country as a whole has hit a new record high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Michigan, California, and Illinois confirmed new cases of measles this week. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2025 has seen the highest number of cases since the disease was locally eliminated from the country a quarter century ago. Though the largest outbreaks this year have since ended, there remains a real chance measles could once again reestablish itself in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New threats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials in &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-1"&gt;Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cookcountypublichealth.org/2025/09/30/cook-county-confirms-another-measles-case/"&gt;Cook County, Illinois,&lt;/a&gt; reported a single new case of measles each this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The California case involved a toddler who had recently traveled domestically, and officials have notified people who could have been exposed to the child at a health care setting. No other community exposure is suspected, however, since the family had been isolated during the most likely period for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Illinois case involved an adult who likely caught measles from an infected individual that health officials had identified several weeks earlier. It’s the third case reported in the county this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The largest new threat of measles comes from Minnesota, however. The Minnesota Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 new cases this week, bringing the state’s total tally to 17 this year. Seven of the cases are connected to three earlier cases, while the remaining three are unrelated and tied to international travel, presumably from areas where measles remains endemic. As is often true, all of the new Minnesota cases have occurred among people unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as of September 30, there have been a total of 1,544 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. so far this year, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week. 92% of these infections have involved people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. The tally in 2025 is well above the previous modern high—1,274 cases in 2019—and is the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good and bad news&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the positive side of things, New Mexico officially &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/9/?view=2279"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the end of its large-scale outbreak late last week. The state had documented 100 cases of measles dating back to February 2025, the second largest outbreak of any state this year. The largest outbreak occurred in Texas, which saw 762 cases; the state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak over in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These outbreaks didn’t end without causing their fair share of misery, however. Around 200 children have been hospitalized for measles this year in the U.S., for instance, while three have died from it—the first U.S. deaths reported in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Measles can have long-term health consequences as well. Studies have shown, for instance, that measles can &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;induce&lt;/a&gt; a form of “immune amnesia,” causing people’s immune systems to lose their memory of other past infections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest cases also demonstrate that measles can easily spark new clusters of illness at a moment’s notice, particularly in regions where vaccine uptake is relatively low. Only a handful of states in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=subject%20to%20change.-,MMR%20vaccine%20coverage%20for%20kindergarteners%20by%20school%20year%20(2009%E2%80%932024),-The%20measles%2C%20mumps"&gt;currently have&lt;/a&gt; childhood vaccination rates for measles above 95%, the level at which herd immunity can reliably prevent widespread outbreaks. And even highly vaccinated states have communities where coverage is much lower than average (Texas’s overall vaccination rate in 2023 and 2024 was just a smidge below 95%, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while a majority of Americans &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/americans-are-already-sick-of-rfk-jr-poll-finds-2000665089"&gt;do still support&lt;/a&gt; vaccines and current vaccine requirements, many of the country’s leaders don’t seem to.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;downplayed&lt;/a&gt; the country’s measles outbreaks and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;regularly undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since taking over as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary this year, as has President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just last week, both men took the podium to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-too-much-liquid-trump-rfk-jr-still-gunning-for-vaccines-as-autism-cause-2000662667"&gt;once again endorse&lt;/a&gt; the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Trump also reiterated his support to separate the perfectly safe and effective combination measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine—a change that would undoubtedly lower vaccination rates for all three diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

(CBS12)  — &lt;/span&gt;Millions of workers spend hours sitting at desks, often with minimal movement throughout the day. But what many don't realize is that this seemingly harmless routine can lead to serious long-term health issues — particularly lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that prolonged sitting puts significant strain on the lumbar spine and surrounding muscles. According to Dr. Z, a local physical therapist and owner of Elite Therapy and Wellness, the lack of movement causes hip flexors to tighten and glute muscles to weaken, both of which contribute to lower back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The body wasn’t designed to sit still for eight or more hours a day,” Dr. Z explains. He says when you stay in one position too long — especially seated — you compress the spine, reduce blood flow, and cause muscle imbalances that lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints in the United States. The American Chiropractic Association reports that up to 80% of people will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives, with sedentary lifestyles being a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;What's Good For You... keeping your heart healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Stretching Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? A simple, consistent stretching routine can make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Z said even taking just five minutes every hour to stand, stretch, and move can reduce stiffness and improve posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the attached video, Dr. Z takes us through two stretches that will help open up your hips and get rid of that stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other common recommended stretches include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seated spinal twists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing hamstring stretches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kneeling hip flexor stretches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cat-cow movements for spinal mobility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These movements not only alleviate tension but also re-engage the core and glutes, which are essential for spinal support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news. &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Sign up for our newsletter &lt;/a&gt;to get the day's top headlines delivered right to your inbox&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC/featured" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC/featured" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s vaccine policies are confusing, to say the least, particularly for the COVID vaccine. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a Senate committee last month that anyone who wants a COVID vaccine &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-kennedy-rfk-congress-senate-vaccines-covid-deaths-hospitals-efa457f139dabcce6f54c0ac2c590512"&gt;can get one&lt;/a&gt;. But senators from both parties said Kennedy’s policies were effectively preventing access to the shot, citing incidents of people being turned away at pharmacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met last month, but some of its members—all selected by Kennedy—were themselves confused on how the panel’s actions affected vaccine access. Pharmacists have scrambled to determine if they are authorized to provide COVID vaccines and who is eligible to receive them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccine access involves a complex web of federal law, national public health guidance, and state regulations that has left even health policy scholars scratching their heads. The confusion is partly the product of a national vaccination system that has been largely unified in practice despite legal and technical distinctions between state and the federal authorities. As the Trump administration has leaned into broader skepticism about vaccines and moved to restrict federal approvals and recommendations for the COVID vaccine, the system has begun to fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the COVID vaccine is broadly accessible on paper, but the confusion surrounding the administration’s policy changes has erected barriers to access in practice, particularly at pharmacies, where roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/vaccinations-administered-pharmacies-medical.html"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of COVID vaccinations last year were administered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this evolve? The policy changes began in May when Kennedy &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;unilaterally restricted&lt;/a&gt; the CDC’s COVID recommendations. He rescinded the agency’s guidance for routine COVID vaccination for healthy children, but the CDC modified the change days later to recommend that the decision to vaccinate children between 6 months and 17 years old be discussed with a health care provider. Kennedy also rescinded the CDC’s recommendation for pregnant women to receive the COVID vaccine, effectively removing the vaccine from the schedule entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the CDC’s guidance involves recommendations rather than mandates, virtually every state pegs its vaccine policies in some way to the CDC immunization schedule and or ACIP recommendations, including what vaccines pharmacists are allowed to administer. After Kennedy’s changes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women#:~:text=Leigh%20Haldeman%2C%2033,get%20the%20shot."&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; soon emerged of pregnant women being repeatedly denied access to the vaccine at pharmacies despite recommendations from their doctors to get the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, pharmacists’ authority to vaccinate is based on state legislators, state statutes, and state regulations,” Allison Hill, the American Pharmacists Association’s (APhA) director of professional affairs, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of those state regulations either allow pharmacists to administer [Food and Drug Administration] approved vaccines or ACIP recommended vaccines.” If healthy pregnant women are a population no longer included in the CDC’s recommendations, then pharmacy access is imperiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next big change came in August when this year’s updated COVID shots were coming online. Vinay Prasad, a Kennedy ally and senior Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine official, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html"&gt;overruled&lt;/a&gt; agency scientists and approved the vaccines only for people over 65 or those with underlying conditions putting them at risk of severe COVID. The FDA normally determines only whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and doesn’t comment on public health recommendations for the vaccine’s deployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change effectively made administering the shot to anyone else “off label.” And because many state regulations prevent pharmacists from providing off-label shots without a prescription, the FDA’s limited approval initially resulted in &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-vaccine-complicated-after-new-fda-restrictions/story?id=125106993#:~:text=In%2041%20states,District%20of%20Columbia."&gt;barriers to access&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people in large states like Florida and New York and more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/cvs-pharmacy-covid-vaccine-16-states.html"&gt;a dozen&lt;/a&gt; others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access was also limited by the timing gap between the FDA’s approval and a subsequent ACIP meeting on September 18-19 to consider recommendations for the year’s updated vaccines. The prevalence of state laws relying on ACIP recommendations meant that many pharmacists could not administer the latest vaccine until the committee recommended the new shots; in 2023, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7242e1.htm#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20protect,and%20might%20be%20updated."&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; recommendations the day after FDA approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when ACIP met, its recommendation—that anyone 6 months and older consult with a provider about COVID vaccination—diverged from the FDA’s guidance. ACIP’s recommendation was broader, including healthy people that were excluded by the FDA’s approval. But the committee also added the additional step of a provider consultation for people over 65 before getting the shot whereas the FDA simply approved the vaccine for that cohort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers are uncertain about what ACIP’s updated recommendations mean for healthy pregnant women, a group excluded by Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html#:~:text=Vaccine-,Pregnancy,-Immuno%2Dcompromised%0A(excluding"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; to the schedule in May. Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that it’s ambiguous, but her understanding of the ACIP vote is that pregnant women are included in the broad recommendation. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco whose work focuses on vaccine legal issues, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; she doesn’t think ACIP intended to include pregnant women in its votes, noting the committee did not expressly address Kennedy’s previous changes. The chair of ACIP’s COVID working group &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=17474"&gt;seemed to suggest&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that the votes did not address the issue of vaccination for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; asked the CDC to clarify whether ACIP’s COVID guidance includes healthy pregnant women. “ACIP’s recommendation applies to all individuals six months and older,” an HHS spokesperson said in response to the request for comment. “It includes an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19. High-risk groups [include] those who are pregnant or recently pregnant.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the cascading uncertainty, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/29/dopl-pharmacists-dont-need-prescription-covid-shot-eligible-consumers-utah/"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; have now changed regulations to safeguard vaccine access, including allowing pharmacists to administer the COVID vaccine without a prescription and re-anchoring vaccine rules to what &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32835/AAP-releases-evidence-based-immunization-schedule"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; recommend instead of relying on just the CDC or its vaccine advisory panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[States] are giving authority to our pharmacists to do this,” said Kates, who co-authored a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of state vaccine changes. “It’s basically, ‘Here’s our recommendation that they can give COVID vaccines to anyone ages 3 and older. Or, we are changing … our regulation or language” to align with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHIP, the health insurance industry’s trade association, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that its members would continue to cover vaccines including COVID and flu shots. The announcement came the day before the ACIP meeting, reflecting both a pointed rebuke of the committee and further fragmentation of vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people in most states should now technically be able to get the vaccine at a pharmacy. Amy Thibault, a spokeswoman for CVS, said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s pharmacies currently offer COVID vaccines to most people without a prescription in 48 states. CVS pharmacies in Georgia and Louisiana still require a prescription until the CDC formally adopts ACIP’s recommendations into the agency’s immunization schedule. Thibault added that the minimum age someone must be in order to get the vaccine at a pharmacy will vary by state rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibault also told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that in all 50 states pharmacists are able to fulfill the “clinical decision-making” role of a provider required for COVID vaccination; HHS also said in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html#:~:text=Individual%20decision%2Dmaking%20is%20referred%20to%20on%20the%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20adult%20and%20child%20immunization%20schedules%20as%20vaccination%20based%20on%20shared%20clinical%20decision%2Dmaking%2C%20which%20references%20providers%20including%20physicians%2C%20nurses%2C%20and%20pharmacists."&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that pharmacists can serve in that role. When asked whether the new consultation requirement could create workload problems for pharmacists, she said there shouldn’t be challenges: “It’s simply a conversation between the pharmacist and patient to gauge whether the patient has any questions or concerns.” Hill, the APhA director, agreed, saying the additional burden would be marginal but adding that, “It may take a little bit longer than it used to in pharmacies because the pharmacist has to have a conversation with the patient about their overall health status, underlying conditions, and just discussion about the risk and the benefits of getting the vaccination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the state changes, confusion and uncertainty about vaccine eligibility and access are still widespread among pharmacists, doctors, and patients alike. What has emerged on the ground is patchwork access with individual pharmacies and pharmacists coming to different conclusions about administering COVID vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are continued &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/covid-vaccines-are-hard-to-get-even-in-states-that-expanded-access/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of problems with vaccine access even in states that have adjusted their regulations and at large chain pharmacies, companies presumably best positioned to push out updated guidance to their stores. Independent pharmacy owners also are struggling to track the state and federal changes. “Each store manager is interpreting it differently and maybe each pharmacist is interpreting it differently. In the absence of standard guidance, that’s what happens,” Jennifer Avegno, the director of the New Orleans Health Department, &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=Dr.%20Jennifer%20Avegno,that%E2%80%99s%20what%20happens.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the problem is likely due to providers’ uncertainty navigating fragmentation in vaccine policy and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/well/covid-vaccines-guidelines-fall-2025.html#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20if,policies%20didn%E2%80%99t%20require."&gt;fears&lt;/a&gt; about taking actions &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=COVID%20vaccines%20are,in%20doing%20this.%E2%80%9D"&gt;they feel&lt;/a&gt; could expose them to liability or risk their licenses. National emergency authorizations and authorities exercised during the pandemic meant that pharmacists didn’t have to worry about state law versus federal guidance or even insurance coverage. “The fact that states had varying policies before, that didn’t matter in the emergency,” Kates said. “Not only was the government providing free COVID vaccines, but pharmacies, and pharmacists were all protected from any liability concern and given broad emergency authority to vaccinate anyone 3 and older, which helped get people very used to going to pharmacies [for vaccines].”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond access issues, the message coming from public health authorities like ACIP is that the vaccine is not recommended as routine, and Trump administration officials and advisers have &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt; misleading and inaccurate claims about the risks of the vaccine itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the current administration’s messaging on vaccines, the CDC had already begun moving away from recommending that providers and patients simply discuss whether to get the vaccine—a process known as shared clinical decision-making (SCDM)—because the framework created confusion for doctors and patients. For example, last June, ACIP voted to shift its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) guidance away from SCDM and to routine recommendation for specific groups. ACIP working group members noted that “[c]ompared to universal recommendations, SCDM does not have a clear call to action” and “not all providers who give vaccines are comfortable with SCDM or feel it is within their scope of practice.” They cited a 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8342675/"&gt;physician survey&lt;/a&gt; that found 76 percent of respondents thought that shared clinical decision-making creates confusion and 42 percent said they didn’t know how to implement it as intended by ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez—the administration’s own pick who spent just a month on the job. Monarez testified to Congress that she was fired because she refused to preemptively rubber-stamp ACIP’s upcoming recommendations. Monarez was replaced by a senior Kennedy aide who’s currently serving as acting CDC director. But after the latest ACIP meeting, the panel’s updated COVID recommendations—while narrower than past guidance—are broader than the FDA’s and unlike Kennedy’s May changes to the CDC schedule, they appear to include healthy pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More uncertainty about vaccine access could follow if Kennedy decides to reject ACIP’s recommendations or issue new CDC recommendations of his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 14:51:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5LVTdwVzRDTWkwZlhoaWFlMHMwY09wVl9SOEc5YjFydXg3WGo1bmFRUTA0U1VZWkZERmV1WlhpdWN6a1BuSkdiWnRsdlhTbVB0bDl1ZGNjZENvSS0wZGFyTDhDUVhTYkJEd2I3VkdydHZTcm9DQ3c</guid></item><item><title>FDA负责人表示，预计更年期症状激素治疗的“黑匣子”警告将很快发生变化- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/02/health/menopause-hrt-warning-change-makary</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Food and Drug Administration plans to make changes soon to the lengthy black box warning on many hormone replacement products for women with menopause symptoms, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00042e6euz6hjv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are in serious discussions now about what to do about the black box warning, and I think you’ll hear something on it very soon,” Makary told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/chasing-life"&gt;Chasing Life&lt;/a&gt;” podcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00052e6eqyl89zt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warn about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00062e6eydtauwl4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The warning was added after &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195120" target="_blank"&gt;a large government-funded study&lt;/a&gt; found that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had higher risks for some kinds of cancers, heart disease and stroke compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00072e6erd0ydgwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the study and the label change, prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy drugs for women dropped by more than 70%, and doctors became reluctant to prescribe them.

            “It’s really a tragedy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2823976?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamahealthforum.2024.3128" target="_blank"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000a2e6eeahhqn3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer analyses of the original study, called the Women’s Health Initiative, have since found that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, may safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000b2e6eq8utzfsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also said hormone replacement therapy may also have important benefits like reducing bone loss, heart disease risk and memory loss,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000c2e6efzlmyczo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women live longer and feel better on hormone replacement therapy when started before age 60,” Makary told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000d2e6el3zwtay9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The potential change follows a July &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;meeting of experts&lt;/a&gt;, convened by the FDA, to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000e2e6e1gf8kh7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am begging the FDA, and all of us are begging, please remove the box label,” said Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “And please stop harming women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000f2e6e2vb3kdk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some women’s health experts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;say the FDA overstepped when it applied the boxed warning to all forms of estrogen replacement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000g2e6ebps4216p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is a real mistake,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the principal investigators of the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000h2e6ezlo35gk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some forms don’t raise estrogen levels in the blood, so they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;aren’t likely to raise a woman’s cancer risk.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For example, studies have found that low doses of estrogen delivered by tablets, creams or rings in the vagina can safely treat symptoms of dryness, painful sex and urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women, Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000i2e6eo8ak6a09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning, though, may stop women from using them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000j2e6ep9nps398@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It scares them away. And even after they purchase the product, they just don’t take it,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000k2e6evbrrtjuy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is really where women are being tremendously undertreated and are suffering unnecessarily due to a boxed warning that is just class labeling. All hormone therapy products get exactly the same boxed warning, and it is really harming women,” said Manson, who is chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000l2e6e9ijl6hnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson said it would also be reasonable for the FDA to consider removing the warnings on estrogen-containing therapies that are delivered through the skin in patches, sprays or creams to relieve the symptoms of menopause like hot flashes and night sweats. Those deliver hormones into the bloodstream, but observational studies suggest that they have a more favorable balance of risks and benefits than pills, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000m2e6ehkbfxnpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson feels less certain about removing the boxed warning from estrogen-containing pills that are taken by mouth, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000n2e6e5thizgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s where it’s evidence-based and justified,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000o2e6esv56zmbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797867" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; by the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that, in women who are past menopause, there was no net benefit to taking either estrogen alone – prescribed for women who’ve had their uterus removed – or a combination of estrogen and progestin – which is typically prescribed for women who still have their uterus – to prevent chronic health conditions such as heart disease and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000p2e6e7a4xb2au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s less clear is whether a woman who starts hormone therapies in perimenopause need to stay on them long-term to get memory, heart and bone benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000q2e6e33aad8en@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a very good question,” said Dr. Roberta Diaz Brinton, a neuroscientist who studies estrogen’s effects on the brain at the University of Arizona. “We need to answer that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000r2e6em089svhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts say there’s not enough scientific evidence to support long-term use of hormones to prevent heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000s2e6ek7txx1zv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;Four medical societies&lt;/a&gt; — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology — support the use hormones to alleviate menopausal symptoms, but they don’t recommend continued use for preventing chronic conditions like heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000t2e6ew8v7t6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leslie Cho, who runs Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center, said she’s supportive of the idea of lifting the warning from vaginal estrogen cream. “It’s never made sense on the cream,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000u2e6e83yb1330@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Cho said she’s worried that some of the benefits being discussed are drawn from after-the-fact analyses of studies that weren’t designed to look at those outcomes in the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000v2e6e30si3go3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m so glad to hear the FDA chair talk about this, because then, if that’s the case, they should do a study. They should fund a study,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000w2e6e178cjacs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a world where people can get hormones prescribed over the internet, Cho said she worries too many women could start taking hormones when they have risks like high blood pressure, obesity or high cholesterol that could overshadow the benefits. Even in younger women, studies show hormones may increase the risk of dangerous blood clots, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000x2e6e9nbxedog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women have to talk to their physicians about hormone replacement therapy before they believe in all the hype that’s currently ongoing, because so much of it is hype,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stem cell therapy reversed stroke damage in mice, regenerating neurons and restoring movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The findings bring scientists closer to human treatments that could one day transform recovery after brain injury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough in Stroke Recovery With Stem Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in four adults suffer a stroke in their lifetime, leaving around half of them with residual damage such as paralysis or speech impairment because internal bleeding or a lack of oxygen supply kill brain cells irreversibly. No therapies currently exist to repair this kind of damage. “That’s why it is essential to pursue new therapeutic approaches to potential brain regeneration after diseases or accidents,” says Christian Tackenberg, the Scientific Head of Division in the Neurodegeneration Group at the University of Zurich (UZH) Institute for Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells have the potential to regenerate brain tissue, as a team led by Tackenberg and postdoctoral researcher Rebecca Weber has now compellingly shown in two studies that were conducted in collaboration with a group headed by Ruslan Rust from the University of Southern California. “Our findings show that neural stem cells not only form new neurons, but also induce other regeneration processes,” Tackenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_495468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-495468" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-495468" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-777x437.jpg" alt="Human Neural Stem Cells in Culture" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-777x437.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-400x225.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-768x432.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-150x84.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-450x253.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-495468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human neural stem cells in culture. Cell nuclei are stained in blue, the neural stem cell-specific filament protein Nestin is shown in green, and the neural stem cell transcription factor Sox1 in red. Credit: University of Zurich&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;New Neurons From Human Stem Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies employed human neural stem cells, from which different cell types of the nervous system can form. The stem cells were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which in turn can be manufactured from normal human somatic cells. For their investigation, the researchers induced a permanent stroke in mice, the characteristics of which closely resemble the manifestation of stroke in humans. The animals were genetically modified so that they would not reject the human stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week after stroke induction, the research team transplanted neural stem cells into the injured brain region and observed subsequent developments using a variety of imaging and biochemical methods. “We found that the stem cells survived for the full analysis period of five weeks and that most of them transformed into neurons, which actually even communicated with the already existing brain cells,” Tackenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Brain Regeneration Beyond Neurons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found other markers of regeneration: new formation of blood vessels, an attenuation of inflammatory response processes, and improved blood-brain barrier integrity. “Our analysis goes far beyond the scope of other studies, which focused on the immediate effects right after transplantation,” Tackenberg explains. Fortunately, stem cell transplantation in mice also reversed motor impairments caused by stroke. Proof of that was delivered in part by an AI-assisted mouse gait analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clinical Application Moving Closer to Reality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was designing the studies, Tackenberg already had his sights set on clinical applications in humans. That’s why, for example, the stem cells were manufactured without the use of reagents derived from animals. The Zurich-based research team developed a defined protocol for that purpose in collaboration with the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA) at Kyoto University. This is important for potential therapeutic applications in humans. Another new insight discovered was that stem cell transplantation works better when it is performed not immediately after a stroke but a week later, as the second study verified. In the clinical setting, that time window could greatly facilitate therapy preparation and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges, Safety Measures, and Future Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging results of the studies, Tackenberg warns that there is still work to be done. “We need to minimize risks and simplify a potential application in humans,” he says. Tackenberg’s group, again in collaboration with Ruslan Rust, is currently working on a kind of safety switch system that prevents the uncontrolled growth of stem cells in the brain. Delivery of stem cells through endovascular injection, which would be much more practicable than a brain graft, is also under development. Initial clinical trials using induced stem cells to treat Parkinson’s disease in humans are already underway in Japan, Tackenberg reports. “Stroke could be one of the next diseases for which a clinical trial becomes possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983" target="_self"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of colonoscopy patients revealed that most used their phones on the toilet at least once a week -- and that those phone-on-the-toilet users showed a 46% increased risk for hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;The cause and effect are clear. Caught up in news or games or social media, bathroom users stay seated on the throne longer, with research showing phone users tend to spend more than 5 minutes doing their business. The study says that hemorrhoids are associated with prolonged sitting on the toilet, as well as constipation and increased straining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Add%20CNET%22%7D" target="_self"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as a preferred Google source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 125 colonoscopy patients at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Study who participated in the study answered questions about their bathroom phone habits, and endoscopists evaluated their hemorrhoids (just in case you think you have a bad job). Of all the respondents, 66% used smartphones while sitting on the toilet, and those participants tended to be younger than those who didn't. More than one-third (37.3%) of smartphone users spent more than 5 minutes sitting on the toilet per visit, while only 7.1% of those without smartphones spent that long seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the numbers were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, exercise activity and "straining and fiber intake," results showed a 46% increased risk for hemorrhoids. Men were more likely than women to spend 6 minutes or more on the toilet, in case you wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who used smartphones while on the toilet also admitted to getting less exercise than those who didn't, which the researchers said "could signify a higher level of engagement with technology and a more sedentary lifestyle outside of the toileting environment." (Yes, "toileting environment." Otherwise known as just "the toilet.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common toilet phone activity was reading news, with 54.3% admitting to doing so, and 44.4% saying they were participating in social media while on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn't directly connect constipation with time spent on the toilet, but Dr. Eamonn Quigley, chairman of gastroenterology at Houston Methodist, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/well/phone-use-toilet-hemorrhoids-constipation.html" target="_self"&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that it's likely those who sit hunched over their phones while on the toilet might be more likely to experience constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're grossed out by the idea of your phone being in close connection with toilet time, you're not alone. Doctors told the NYT the obvious: Fecal material can get on your hands while you're wiping and be transferred to your phone, and flushing with the toilet lid open can also spray fecal matter onto your phone. Sure, you wash your hands, but now the stuff is on your phone, so it jumps right back on your hands after you dry them and start scrolling again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, you're probably going to scroll your phone while occupied in the bathroom. But this study notes that you should be aware that the phone's fun distractions might make you sit there longer than you planned, and that could have painful consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 13:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNaW1LV0g3M29NcVROdGxzdy04SzhiVDhQM2JhMlRYWEhGdzEyWmVBb2JFczFHWXBETzlpOEpaXzdiY1ZjNUNmSUx6RGE2dmNtQVNqa0ZSOVh0aDd4Y1lyWU9BRFZlYmd1LXBqQm1Bc1JmVmRycjVnZ1U1M3VLNkZ4N05RZml4OXR5cm9PMEhVR0ItYkl1bFlFNXMtdlh1OW5ybEE</guid></item><item><title>研究将自闭症的起源追溯到人类智力的崛起- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study finds  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; may lie at the crux of what makes humans uniquely intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that some of the same genetic changes that make the human brain unique also made humans more neurodiverse," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1096746"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University neuroscientist Alexander Starr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both autism and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental brain differences that can have a mix of negative and positive impacts (including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-015-2518-2"&gt;increased creativity&lt;/a&gt;), to be very clear, the new study's findings don't indicate that neurodivergent people are more or less intelligent; that's not at all what was measured here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, the researchers found that genes responsible for human intellect also increase our chances of having autistic or &lt;span&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/span&gt; traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-can-boost-cognitive-performance-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;Autism Can Boost Cognitive Performance, And We May Finally Know Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is rare to find the behavioral traits of autism or schizophrenia in non-human primates, Starr and colleagues suspected there may be a genetic reason these conditions seem to be unique to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they compared RNA from over a million cells across three brain regions in six mammalian species: mice, marmosets, rhesus macaques, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that generally, the most common types of brain cells stayed relatively unchanged, even between species. There was one major exception, however: the most abundant type of neocortical neurons, layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons, changed much quicker in humans than other primates across evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pattern was confirmed across multiple databases, and using brain  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; made from chimp and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"&gt;neocortical&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain is involved with high-order functioning, including cognition, reasoning, and language. The rapid transformation of specialized neurons in this region includes changes in genes associated with autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175791" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404.jpg" alt="Autism May Be a Trade-Off For Human Genius, Study Finds" class="wp-image-175791 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404.jpg 641w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404-600x217.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175791" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As the researchers predicted, the strongest selection pressure was detected on brain cell types that were rarer in most primates. (Starr et al., &lt;em&gt;MBE&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's still unclear why these genes helped our human ancestors survive&lt;/span&gt;, but as some of the genes have been associated with a delay in brain development, the researchers suspect these changes may have helped increase our capacity for language and complex thinking. These traits have clear advantages, even if they also increase the chances of certain neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best-known example of this type of evolutionary trade-off is in human populations living in regions with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. People here have a higher chance of developing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876"&gt;sickle cell anemia&lt;/a&gt; because the gene behind the condition also conveys a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-our-red-blood-cells-keep-evolving-to-fight-malaria-96117"&gt;30 percent reduction in susceptibility&lt;/a&gt; to the malaria parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date supporting the long-standing hypothesis that natural selection for human-specific traits has increased the likelihood of certain disorders," Starr and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf189"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They caution, however, that while they have established a correlation, more research is required to understand the drivers of the strong selection forces they've uncovered. If their suspicions are correct, it would mean humans wouldn't exist as we are without the existence of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a little over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html"&gt;3 in 100 children in the US&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with &lt;span&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/span&gt;. This is controversially increasing (only slightly, to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/autism-is-not-a-scare-story-what-parents-need-to-know-about-medications-in-pregnancy-genetic-risk-and-misleading-headlines-264964"&gt;about 4 in 100&lt;/a&gt;), due to increased awareness of autistic traits and the broadening of diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-finds"&gt;adds to&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02009-6"&gt;mountain of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that autism is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.015"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt;, with up to 80 percent of cases linked to inherited gene mutations. New mutations likely account for &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/news-article/is-autism-genetic"&gt;the remaining 20 percent&lt;/a&gt;. A similarly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1163361"&gt;high level of heritability&lt;/a&gt; is seen in schizophrenia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf189"&gt;Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how every dog has their own “thing?” Some are professional couch potatoes, while others act like wannabe sprinters at the park. Then there’s Oatmeal. Not only is this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; wholesome and comforting, just like his name, but he’s also an expert in making lake day funnier, as can be seen in this video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His mom, who posts about his adventures on @adriaandoatmeal, filmed him in Lake Tahoe, striking poses that honestly make him look more like a human than a dog. The clip has been making the rounds online for all the right reasons, because when Oatmeal decides to put on a show, it’s equal parts impressive and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owner-shows-golden-retriever-s-impressive-skills-in-lake-video"&gt;Owner shows Golden Retriever’s impressive skills in lake video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video drew over 10.9K likes and plenty of comments from fans who were seriously impressed by Oatmeal’s water skills. Golden Retrievers are bred to be excellent water dogs. They are intelligent, highly trainable, and extremely focused when given a task. Oatmeal is showing off these traits by standing nearly upright in the water, three-quarters submerged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He shuffles his feet, balancing exceptionally well. His human is amazed: “Wait, this is actually really impressive,” she says. He then strikes a pose, leading his mom to exclaim, “This is his hunting stance, by the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the hunt is secretive, his mom tries to give him a mission: “Do you want to get that rock for me?” Oatmeal swims right up to her, ready for instructions. While there’s a little mix-up with which rock he’s supposed to grab, his determination doesn’t waver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He approaches a rock on the lake bed, feeling it out with a paw. He then dunks his head under the water to grab his prize. “Yay, good boy,” his mom cheers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The feat is so impressive that even his friend, Crusty Carl, is seen celebrating his success. One fan called it “top-tier hunting stance.” Another commenter was equally impressed by his aquatic gymnastics: “No arm floaties and balancing on back legs is hella impressive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: My daughter was recently visiting and tested positive for COVID. Since my last COVID vaccine was eight months ago, I searched for how much protection I still had and understood the response to be little to none. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5TSLBKBR35BMNJUZR7UGW4SXMQ"&gt;So, why is the recommendation for vaccination only once per year and not more frequent so that we always have some protection? -- B.J.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F54ZCL6T75AFVDA2OQLDZP4YEM"&gt;ANSWER: The vaccine ideally provides immunity to an infection. Many of the best vaccines that we recommend provide high-level immunity against getting the disease, although there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BAWSEEXUNBD2TA5RTQCIN67YZE"&gt;The mRNA COVID vaccines provide 85% to 90% protection for the first three months or so, but the immunity wanes to only 50% to 60% effectiveness against getting the disease after six to eight months. The vaccine efficacy depends on the particular vaccine and precise variant of COVID. So, you are right that the vaccine you got eight months ago provides little protection against getting the disease now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2ZROTX76ARAZLF2DUFKNI2OHZA"&gt;However, the vaccine also protects people against severe diseases and the currently circulating variants of COVID, even if it can’t protect you as well in getting the disease at all. The likelihood of hospitalization and death is decreased for much longer after vaccination, especially if a person has had multiple vaccines. This protection extends for a year and possibly longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FTMP5S3CSJDERNUMCEWERMWLDU"&gt;Getting vaccines twice yearly is not harmful and would provide more consistent (but still not perfect) protection, but once yearly vaccination does protect against severe diseases, including hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7KLLF2HTZ5GYJHBEPTDGCTCCVM"&gt;People with immune systems that don’t work perfectly, such as the elderly, and people who are on medicines that affect the immune system (such as organ transplantation, chemotherapy, and some treatments for severe autoimmune diseases) will not respond as well to the vaccine. So, they may particularly benefit from more frequent vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QTDVVZ4H55BHHAASSR3F6XCJRE"&gt;Another prevention option for people with severe immune system diseases is a monoclonal antibody called pemivibart, which is given by an intravenous infusion.

ROACH: A beloved cousin of mine was given the wrong type of blood as a teenager and subsequently died. I, myself, am type O Rh-negative. What are the odds of this happening today, and how can this be prevented? Is this a huge problem in this country, and if one is traveling abroad, how can the hospital staff be alerted? Is the blood tested before every transfusion? -- R.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GLK64DJPEJAWLDDYBVZ7VJVFB4"&gt;ANSWER: I am very sorry about your cousin. This is an extraordinarily rare event, with four definite cases occurring in the United States (out of 10 million transfusions) in the most recently reported year. It should never happen; there are supposed to be multiple layers of protection to keep this from occurring.

Hotel staff were immediately alarmed upon her arrival, as workers reported she was “emaciated” with sunken eyes and protruding collarbones. She had grown so weak that one evening, she had to be escorted back to her room by the night clerk as she was unable to do so herself, the staff recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her deteriorating health was also evident. Her fingernails had turned yellow, her teeth had begun to rot, and her body showed signs of severe nutrient deficiency. Concerned for their guest, the hotel employees requested Karolina to seek medical help multiple times. However, each request was met with the same declinatory answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, three days into her stay, hotel workers grew concerned after receiving a message from one of Karolina’s local friends who had not heard from her since her arrival. The hotel staff rushed to check on her, but when they entered her room, they found her motionless and unresponsive. She was later declared dead from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Also Read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/14yearold-girl-dies-after-secret-breast-enlargement-surgery-father-demands-investigation-101758815083551.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="14-year-old girl dies after secret breast enlargement surgery, father demands investigation"&gt;14-year-old girl dies after secret breast enlargement surgery, father demands investigation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is a fruitarian diet dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to The Sun, at the time of her death, Karolina was suffering from osteoporosis and an albumin deficiency, both linked to prolonged malnutrition. Her friends said that she had long struggled with body image issues and had battled anorexia during her teenage years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, while studying in the UK, she developed an interest in yoga and veganism, which eventually led her towards “fruitarianism” - a restrictive diet that relies almost entirely on raw fruit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, her social media posts reflected her deteriorating health, prompting her parents and friends to repeatedly urge her to seek treatment. However, despite several interventions from loved ones, she refused to abandon her extreme dietary practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time of her death, the 27-year-old weighed just 22 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 12:39:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的疫苗接种图揭示了疫情爆发的风险。您的县受到保护吗？ -今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/10/02/vaccination-rates-drop-maps-outbreak-risks/86224099007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vaccination coverage is eroding across the United States at the same time measles cases are surging, according to new county-level data compiled from state health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles outbreaks are infecting more people this year than in any year since the early 1990s and have already killed three. So far in 2025, all but eight states have reported measles cases, a disease the U.S. declared eliminated in 2000. Nearly 92% of these cases were among the unvaccinated or people with unknown vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Federal data released in July showed that childhood vaccination rates, which had remained steady for years, have declined, while the share of children exempted for religious and philosophical reasons has increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What we see is that as trust erodes, as vaccination rates drop, the first thing that you see are measles outbreaks,” said Adam Ratner, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ratner said the outbreaks should act as a public health warning system, signaling that other diseases could follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to look beyond that, because the diseases that are also vaccine-preventable, but maybe are a little less contagious than measles, are the ones that you'll see after that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To assess coverage at the local level, Johns Hopkins University compiled &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/MMR_data/refs/heads/main/mmr_data_sources.csv" data-type="link" data-id="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/MMR_data/refs/heads/main/mmr_data_sources.csv" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from state health agencies that, in the absence of a federal database, sheds light on how vulnerable communities are to outbreaks. USA TODAY later expanded this effort by adding data for states missing from the university's database and filling gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An analysis of this combined data, covering counties in 41 states, showed that routine vaccine coverage among children has slipped in most counties, leaving more communities vulnerable today than before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In at least three out of four counties, vaccination coverage is below 95%, an immunity threshold experts say is needed to prevent widespread outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The fact that there are so many counties below this threshold means there is a lot of exposure risk,” said Lauren Gardner, director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It doesn’t mean there’s definitely going to be an outbreak, but the risk is higher if a case is introduced in a community,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts also warn that when coverage falls below 90%, the risk of outbreaks rises sharply. Children who are immunocompromised or too young to be vaccinated rely on community immunity, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Today, about 63% of counties meet that minimum threshold, compared to 84% before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The data, together with interviews with public health experts, underscore that skepticism around the COVID-19 vaccine has seeped into broader attitudes toward immunization, worsened by the spread of misinformation and disinformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vaccine skeptics falsely claim that the measles vaccine causes autism, a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism" data-type="link" data-id="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;claim repeatedly disproven by extensive scientific research&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, rising vaccine skepticism has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children against dangerous diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A September &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/new-kff-washington-post-survey-explores-parents-trust-in-and-confusion-about-childhood-vaccines-as-the-trump-administration-revamps-federal-policies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation–Washington Post survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 9% of parents believe the false claim linking the MMR vaccine to autism, and nearly half are unsure what to believe. About one in six parents reported delaying or skipping vaccines (excluding seasonal flu and COVID-19), often citing safety concerns or distrust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Parents who identify as Republican, younger, or homeschool their children are among the most likely to delay or skip vaccines, the survey found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for children: first at 12–15 months, then at 4–6 years. The agency also recommends vaccines for polio, chickenpox, and hepatitis B, a viral infection affecting the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Public health experts say these recommendations are facing challenges under Health Secretary &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-autotag="1eef402e-8d6b-4ca9-ae4b-46a1674522c3" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, an outspoken vaccine critic. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in June, replacing some with vaccine skeptics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The ACIP has &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/09/18/rfk-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-mmrv-babies/86199355007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/09/18/rfk-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-mmrv-babies/86199355007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;already changed the MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, removing the recommendation for children under 4. The committee also considered changes to hepatitis B recommendations, but a vote was delayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts warn these shifts could add confusion and further erode vaccination rates, even as clarity on vaccine safety and access remains critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To that end, Ratner said, granular data collected by Johns Hopkins University and USA TODAY is important for identifying vulnerable populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Often people will look at state rates, which are important,” Ratner said. “But really what we find is that what matters is much more local rates — at the level of the county or even smaller.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University-USA TODAY data is based on county-level vaccination compliance among kindergarteners — and, in a few cases, K–6 or K–12 students — covering either MMR vaccinations or all doses required for school enrollment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are caveats: record collection varies by state, so state-by-state comparisons should be made cautiously. Because some agencies track students’ compliance with vaccine requirements — not actual vaccination status — the true vaccination rate could be lower than reported in those instances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For example, Oregon excludes exempted students in completion rates, while Wisconsin doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“A student can be compliant with the school law either by being up to date on vaccines or by submitting a waiver, so school compliance rates could be higher than the vaccination rate of the school population,” said Jennifer Miller, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles once sickened millions of Americans and killed hundreds each year. In the 1960s, the U.S. launched its vaccination program, eventually eradicating measles before the turn of the century. By 1980, all 50 states had adopted school vaccine mandates, requiring children to be vaccinated before enrollment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is particularly dangerous because it can spread before symptoms appear. Even with a low fatality rate, the virus can cause lasting complications, including brain damage, neurological problems, and blindness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As of September 30 this year, the U.S. has reported nearly 1,550 measles cases, surpassing totals from any outbreak since the early 1990s. Only 2019, when the disease spread through unvaccinated communities in New York, comes close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The first outbreak in 2025 occurred in the Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccination rates are low. The virus then spread across West Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Gaines County has reported 414 cases this year, nearly a quarter of the national total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There, vaccination coverage among kindergartners has averaged around 82.4% in recent years, 12.6 points below what experts call community immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 57% of counties were considered fully protected against outbreaks. That figure has since dropped to 25%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The decline in coverage spanned nearly three-quarters of counties, with each experiencing an average four-point drop. Only two states, Connecticut and Maryland, now have every county above the immunity threshold, while nine in 10 counties in Maine and New York meet it. No counties clear the bar in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Utah, or Wisconsin — the same states with high exemption rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In July, the CDC estimated that &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/kids-back-to-school-vaccine-rates-exemptions/85629130007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/kids-back-to-school-vaccine-rates-exemptions/85629130007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;nearly 286,000 kindergarteners lacked proof of completing the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; series during the 2024–25 school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Meanwhile, more parents are exempting their children from vaccination on religious or philosophical grounds, though medical exemptions have remained flat. Non-medical exemption rates rose to 3.4% in 2024–25, up from 2% a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even small increases can have a big impact, said Elizabeth Williams, senior policy manager at Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Every increase reduces the ability to reach the threshold that scientists believe protects the community,” Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts recommend keeping exemption rates below 5%, yet 17 states now exceed that level. Idaho leads at 15%, followed by Utah and Oregon at 10% each, and Arizona and Alaska at 9%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Rising exemption rates are concerning; especially if you work under the assumption that a child who has an exemption on file with their school is unvaccinated,” said AJ McWhorter, a spokesperson for Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“During a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak, then there are more children who would be at risk for contracting the disease and who would presumably need to be excluded from school,” McWhorter said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Policy shifts may further lower vaccination rates.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;New research reveals that three venomous snake species—including one of the most venomous snakes in the world—are even worse than we thought. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/mamba"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mambas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—large, highly venomous arboreal snakes in sub-Saharan Africa—weren’t bad enough, researchers have discovered that the venoms of three mamba species have a nasty one-two-punch attack that explains why antivenoms sometimes don’t work. The study reveals that the venoms are more neurologically complex than previously believed, with significant implications for antivenom treatments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Black Mamba, Western Green Mamba and Jamesons Mamba snakes aren’t just using one form of chemical weapon, they’re launching a coordinated attack at 2 different points in the nervous system,” Bryan Fry, a biologist at the University of Queensland and a co-author of a study published late last month in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/17/10/481"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said in a university statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The solution to a clinical mystery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mamba snake bites are responsible for 30,000 deaths every year, according to the statement. If you’re unlucky enough to be bitten by one of the aforementioned three mamba species, you’ll experience flaccid or limp paralysis. The good news is that limp paralysis is treatable by current antivenoms. The bad news is that, according to the study, these venoms then attack another part of the nervous system, triggering spastic paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The venom first blocks nerve signals from reaching the muscles but after the antivenom is administered, it then overstimulates the muscles. It’s like treating one disease and suddenly revealing another,” Fry explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study solves an enduring mystery regarding mamba victims; some patients initially seem to get better with antivenom but then start experiencing painful, uncontrolled spasms. Before this study, the researchers thought it was only the fourth species of mamba—the Eastern Green Mamba—capable of triggering spastic paralysis. Talk about a nasssssty sssssurprise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A call for specialized antivenom&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more bad news!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We also found the venom function of the mambas was different depending on their geographic location, particularly within populations of the Black Mamba from Kenya and South Africa,” Lee Jones, a co-author of the study and a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland, said in the statement. “This further complicates treatment strategies across regions because the antivenoms are not developed to counteract the intricacies of the different venoms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers should now seek to create specialized antivenoms to improve outcomes, Fry said. Investigating venom dynamics and the limits of current antivenoms has obvious implications for snakebite treatment, the researcher concluded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This kind of translational venom research can help doctors make better decisions in real time and ultimately save lives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;P.S. What’s a snake’s favorite dance? The mamba!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Public trust in the agency had dropped considerably since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. And US health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00439-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00439-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who oversees the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, had called the agency a “cesspool of corruption” that needed to be fundamentally rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a month into Monarez’s tenure, US President Donald Trump fired her. She had lost the trust of Kennedy, who only a month earlier had said he had “full confidence” in her ability to lead the agency and that she had “unimpeachable scientific credentials”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conflict spilled into public view when each presented their version of events to US senators at separate hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Monarez was dismissed, she said, for refusing to fire top scientists at the agency or pre-approve vaccine recommendations without first considering the relevant scientific data. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02845-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02845-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Kennedy testified that Monarez had told him that she wasn’t trustworthy&lt;/a&gt;, so he ousted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy had also told Monarez that CDC employees were “killing children and they don’t care”, were “bought by the pharmaceutical industry” and “forced people to wear masks and social distance like a dictatorship”, she testified. These alleged comments came after a deadly shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, soon after she became director. The gunman, who targeted the campus to protest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00290-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00290-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, killed police officer David Rose and shattered some 150 windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past few months, Monarez says, have included both “the highlights of my professional career” and the “absolute worst days of my life”. In an exclusive interview — her first since she became CDC director — she tells &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; about the consequential decisions that cost her the job and what’s next for public health in a politicized world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC director is an “inherently political position, but that doesn’t mean that it has to be politically compromised”, says Monarez, who is an immunologist and microbiologist. “The CDC is far too important to just give up on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Before our call, you sent me a photo that seems to be of you as a child with your father and siblings sitting on a tractor with a barn in the background. What was that about?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in rural America, in a family that didn’t have many resources — my dad was a dairy farmer. You live without expecting to have the privileges and material possessions that so many people have. We just knew that you worked hard. You got up early and you treated people with kindness. We lived at or below the poverty line for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents, they’re still alive, thankfully. But they’ve never been wealthy, and they don’t have the advantages of immediate access to high-quality health care, and so I see them still struggling today. When we’re talking in Washington DC, we have to remember that there are millions and millions of Americans like my parents. We can’t leave them behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Before the CDC, you worked at the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00817-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00817-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health&lt;/a&gt; (ARPA-H), a government agency supporting high-risk, high-reward biomedical research. How did that work inform your priorities for CDC?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much of what we built at ARPA-H was free from all of the bureaucratic impediments. We gave ourselves permission to ask: ‘What if we could change the world?’ I wanted to bring that mindset to CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just eight days into your tenure, there was a deadly shooting at CDC headquarters that terrified many members of your staff. Tell me about that experience.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first week was probably one of the highlights of my entire professional career — meeting hundreds of CDC employees who wanted to make a difference and change the world. I got on the plane to come back to [Washington] DC. And I finally got WiFi just before we landed, and all these texts had started coming through: ‘Something’s happening here, we’re hearing there’s a shooter.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03014-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03179-1/d41586-025-03179-1_51459098.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Three ways ex-CDC chief says that Trump team is sidelining science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the most surreal, painful change between this extraordinary enthusiasm of ‘we’re going to change the world with the most amazing people’ to ‘has anyone been killed?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[As I spoke to more CDC staff,] it looked like most were OK, but highly traumatized, because so many people were literally in the line of fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father — after we lost the farm — became a police officer. It was so near and dear to my heart, the willingness of these police officers to sacrifice themselves. I couldn’t stop thinking about Officer Rose losing his life. It could have been my dad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t an abstract, faraway thing. These were real humans who were targeted with real bullets that were not intended for buildings — they were intended to cause harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do you make of Kennedy’s characterizations of CDC employees, such as his suggestion they have been ‘bought by the pharmaceuticals industry’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not meet a single human that embodied that rhetoric. They could be making a lot more money [in the private sector].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am worried about the context that we’re placing on our public-health officials, who just want to help people. To contextualize it any other way is to do them such an extraordinary disservice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are we going to incentivize our best and our brightest to contribute to public health, which is thankless? And what happens if we don’t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You also testified that Kennedy had asked you to pre-approve vaccine recommendations that hadn’t yet been made. Was that the main sticking point for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And firing scientists without cause. [At CDC, I] had been with selfless, brilliant, amazing people who just wanted to contribute to wellness. We had already started talking about, ‘How do we restore public trust?’ because ‘just trust us’ doesn’t work any more. So it was [against] that backdrop and then being told I had to fire these people without cause that — as a human, I wouldn’t do that. And as a leader, I wouldn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And being asked to commit [wholeheartedly] without evidence — I would never do that, as a scientist. You have to gather the right data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; last month that Monarez “acted maliciously to undermine the president’s agenda and was fired as a result”. Kennedy conceded, in remarks to Congress, that he had asked Monarez to fire CDC staff members.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;At least ten states say they can no longer trust the CDC and have formed their own alliances, one on the West Coast and one in the Northeast. What do you make of these efforts?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These states are worried about the people who live in their communities. They’re worried about whether they will be able to help to prevent public-health harms. I understand their concerns. It is a reflection of [how much some people can trust] what’s emanating from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t this in some ways playing directly into what this administration is pushing for — a dismantling of the federal government in favour of states’ rights? Is that compatible with the fundamental principles of public health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health doesn’t respect state boundaries. We do need to find a way to work together. I’ll go back to my own upbringing. The rural community where I grew up could easily be left behind [if access to high-quality healthcare is available in one state but not another] and we don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Nutritionally, HFCS is very similar to table sugar (sucrose), which is also made of glucose and fructose in roughly a 50/50 split. &lt;span&gt;However, unlike sucrose, which is a disaccharide (where the two sugars are bonded together), HFCS contains glucose and fructose as individual monosaccharides. In high-fructose corn syrup, “the two are not bonded together and the ratio might be slightly different than 50/50 in the overall product,” Pasquariello said.&lt;/span&gt; Because of its sweetness, stability and low cost, HFCS is commonly used in the food industry, especially in sodas, packaged snacks, condiments and desserts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there health benefits to consuming drinks made with cane sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite any claims you may have heard from cane sugar advocates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; — such as those &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1946694089954771123" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="calling" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68cc1c8fe4b0aa8d99fe99fc" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1946694089954771123" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;calling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; high-fructose corn syrup &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/22/coke-cane-sugar-health-rfk-jr/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="poison" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68cc1c8fe4b0aa8d99fe99fc" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/22/coke-cane-sugar-health-rfk-jr/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or suggesting it is uniquely harmful to the liver and more strongly linked to chronic illnesses like obesity and type 2 diabetes —&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;there aren’t any benefits to consuming cane sugar rather than HFCS.

And if you’re not moving enough and providing your body with a way to use energy from high added sugar intake, health risks rise, Gnau added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxObkxWQVR3Z1FBWXQzVFFlWTE5RkY5Y1JraVpCRzVLakxOMWlBZzhLNVZnbUladGxET1N3bV9ZY3diUTJUbHJIcHFMLU9VSnU3VklwdmVSS0Z1M3didWxuYmRFZ096TDBubnFiVzFHTEFWdzJ2U0hINUVNZFEwaTVvOFlDZENMS0VybEJiNTVZVGdmSHJWaUU2bHhxSDhHdERYQ1pLaWIwUlVweGpoaEg2RdIBtgFBVV95cUxPUmRCc0NpMlJwb2MxREZrcXp2SHRhWVo1WFJUQk5teThXeGtKRlIxaWZXWTdYR2ZEZWo1R3NDQ215U3NEc2NRLUtCYjhWWDkxdmotWGxVTTlrQlRkVFdwSHFpcE5mY20xQ1l0OVVvakVnQms0dWV2TmJWZzd6QmxqZ2x4dk5rOUhySVlNU0pmQXROcExlN1B2STJUcEtzN093UnQ5SE94OE1xakpVVjBkTWhoOElpUQ</guid></item><item><title>在感冒和流感季节您可以做的最糟糕的事情- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-things-cold-flu-season_l_68d95052e4b040e2851e5164</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s officially fall, which means crisp air, cozy sweaters, autumn leaves ― and a fresh wave of colds and flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost inevitable that we will come into contact with at least one of the common respiratory viruses each cold and flu season,” &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1831552298/andrew-b-fleming" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Andrew Fleming" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d95052e4b040e2851e5164" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1831552298/andrew-b-fleming" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Andrew Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, section chief of infectious diseases and immunology at New York University Langone Brooklyn, told HuffPost. “A well-maintained immune system can halt these viruses before an infection sets in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the unpleasant symptoms and schedule disruption, getting sick is hardly anyone’s idea of a good time.

In fact, it’s a matter of etiquette. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These protocols are not just about health ― they are about civility,” said &lt;a href="https://fromtheinsideoutsoe.com/about-founder/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jackie Vernon-Thompson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d95052e4b040e2851e5164" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fromtheinsideoutsoe.com/about-founder/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Jackie Vernon-Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of From the Inside-Out School of Etiquette. “We never know how severely another person may be affected by a virus.

Instead, this should be a frequent practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hand-washing is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick,” Horn said. “Always wash your hands before you eat or after you have been out and about touching things in public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlooking Nutrition And Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor nutrition and dehydration work against you,” Tossounian said. “Your body needs the vitamins, minerals, and hydration from a healthy diet to mount an effective defense, not the inflammatory effects of processed foods and sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should prioritize healthy eating with plenty of immunity-boosting nutrients like vitamin C. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t let yourself get dehydrated,” Horn advised, adding that it’s especially important to drink water and eat nourishing foods when you’re feeling sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleming similarly pointed to the role of heavy alcohol consumption, which can be dehydrating and otherwise impact your immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Both binge drinking and regular heavy alcohol use suppress the immune system and make us more susceptible to respiratory &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;viruses,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: juanma hache via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;juanma hache via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;There are many things you can do to prevent the spread of germs, strengthen your body’s defenses and otherwise decrease your risk of infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently Touching Your Face&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the germ-spreading front, one of the most detrimental habits is infrequent handwashing combined with unconsciously touching your face,” Tossounian said. “Viruses enter your body through the mucous membranes of your eyes, nose and mouth, and your hands are the primary vehicle for getting them there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touching your face is a common habit that can be hard to break, but try to at least reduce the frequency with which you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to minimize touching your face,” Horn said, adding that you might also consider washing your hands before or after you touch your nose or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring Basic Cough And Sneeze Etiquette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most basic actions can really be effective,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.emoryhealthcare.org/provider/sarah-catherine-dupont/2287396" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Sarah Dupont" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d95052e4b040e2851e5164" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://providers.emoryhealthcare.org/provider/sarah-catherine-dupont/2287396" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Sarah Dupont&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at Emory Healthcare and assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine. “Cover your cough, discard used tissues.

Also, avoid sharing food or utensils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t visit grandma if you’re sick,” Dupont said. “Or, if you can’t visit at any other time, at least wear a mask, avoid hugs and kisses, and try to hang out in a well-ventilated area, like outside. Older adults, especially those living in communities with a lot of other older adults, are at much higher risk of being hospitalized if they catch the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vernon-Thompson similarly recommended reconsidering physical greetings if you’re feeling a little under the weather or visiting someone else who is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of shaking hands, a gracious alternative is to place your right hand over your heart, offer a slight nod, and warmly say, ‘It is so nice to see (or meet) you,’” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Going To The Doctor When You Aren’t Getting Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a fever is lasting more than three days, if you are having trouble breathing, or if you have chronic medical conditions that could be worsened from a viral illness, it helps to go see your doctor earlier rather than later,” Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been feeling unwell without improvement, consider reaching out to a health care professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Last summer, when Catherine, Princess of Wales, was &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;diagnosed with cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 42, it was tragic, but it landed a bit differently. At that point, it was clear her diagnosis was part of a &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;clear narrative&lt;/a&gt;: More and more relatively young adults are developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But now, a more complicated story is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to a new study published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2839347"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some of the rise in early-onset cancer is a diagnostic mirage: Doctors are finding cases that would never have led to serious illness anyway. Younger adults — those under 50 — are indeed being diagnosed with cancer at nearly twice the rate they had been in 1990: 60 cases per 100,000 people, up from 30. But the number of metastatic cases, those that are more likely to be aggressive and/or were detected late, has not increased at nearly the same speed. The death rate for the eight cancers covered in the study has remained flat over the last 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Overall, the rise in early-onset cancer appears to be less an epidemic of disease and more an epidemic of diagnosis,” the authors — researchers from Harvard, Brigham Women’s Hospital in Boston, and the University of Texas at Austin — write in their paper’s conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This surprised me. I’m a bit of a hypochondriac, and I’m an adult under 50, and so when I read a headline about the uptick of cancer among my own generation, I certainly think, &lt;em&gt;Oh no, more young adults are getting sick and dying from cancer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there are ways to double-check that assumption — which is exactly what this new paper tries to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The authors decided to look deeper into the overall rising rate of cancer incidence among middle-aged adults and focus specifically on rates of metastatic cancer and death rates, metrics that correlate with more serious illness. And the findings suggest something else besides exposure to new toxins (whether &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904962/"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/ultra-processed-foods-and-cancer-whats-the-connection/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320524005277"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;) could be contributing to the surge of cancer diagnoses among younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It may be that at least &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the story is that we have simply improved our ability to detect cancer. That would frame the recent rise in cases a little differently: Perhaps cancer rates among relatively young adults are soaring because we are catching more cancers that were always out there but used to escape diagnosis, sometimes until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That would be welcome news. But this is a complicated story. Let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-think-about-this-important-new-study-on-early-onset-cancer" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to think about this important new study on early-onset cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The new study examined eight categories of cancer that have been the fastest-rising over the past few decades: thyroid, colorectal, endometrial, kidney, anal, pancreatic, myeloma, and small intestinal. The combined incidence for those cancers has doubled since the 1990s — but the overall mortality rate has barely budged: 5.9 deaths per 100,000, identical in 2022 as it was in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This pattern is particularly apparent for breast cancer, still the most common form for people under 50. While the number of excess diagnoses compared to historical trends has increased substantially since the 1990s, the number of excess deaths compared to the historical average is actually down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The excess diagnoses similarly likely reflect the increased screening intensity in younger patients (i.e., more mammograms, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging) than an increase in the occurrence of clinically meaningful breast cancer,” the study’s authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is nuance to the findings: Death rates for colorectal cancers, the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/well/colon-cancer-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt;much of the recent media coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and uterine cancers have noticeably increased over the study period, for example, even as mortality has fallen for other diseases. When I asked researchers who were unaffiliated with the findings, they emphasized that there are clearly at least some cancers that are genuinely becoming more common and leading to serious illness and death. Grouping all cancers together risks masking those more specific trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I think we should focus more on the individual cancers and what’s going on with them and try not to lump them all together when making the overall inferences,” Timothy Rebbeck, a cancer researcher affiliated with Harvard and Dana Farber, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He said the paper raised important points that should continue to be investigated, but added that “I hope the field and the public do not interpret this single paper as an indictment that increases in early onset cancer are either unimportant or not worthy of a better understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other limitations and alternative explanations for the study’s findings. For example, it is possible that perhaps we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; getting more serious cancers earlier in our lives, but faster detection is preventing cases from becoming metastatic or leading to death. The flat mortality rates may also reflect &lt;a href="/health/415812/cancer-death-rates-myeloma-immunotherapy-smoking"&gt;the many improvements in cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;, such as recent breakthroughs with immunotherapy drugs that have sent survival rates soaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The paper’s researchers argue against both. They point out that previous research into specific cancers, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7232665/"&gt;thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt;, has already found evidence of overdiagnosis. On the possibility that serious cases are being caught earlier, the authors argue that we should then see a decrease in cancers diagnosed after age 50 — but that hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But other experts do see the evidence differently: Rebbeck told me he thought that both improved treatment and earlier detection that staves off serious illness probably explain at least some of the study results. But we need to know more, he emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what are we, the potential patients, to think about this? As a young person prone to health anxiety — I’m 37 — that is an urgent question to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, one study is never the final answer in medical research. The findings here suggest overdiagnosis may explain some of the rise in early-onset cancer, but we need more research to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And second, people should be aware that certain cancers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; appear to be occurring more frequently and with serious clinical consequences.

This is not the first research to raise the possibility that we are too aggressive about diagnosing issues without a clear clinical imperative for doing so. &lt;a href="/health/414241/medical-diagnosis-cancer-autism-long-covid"&gt;I interviewed Dr. Suzanne O’Sullivan earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote an entire book on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;She wrote specifically about cancer overdiagnosis and the mental and financial burden placed on the patients who are told they have cancer, even if that cancer might not actually be a threat to their well-being, the kind of cases contemplated in this new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Within the medical community, this has been well-known for a long time, but it just doesn’t leak into the general conversation,” she told me. “The bottom line is if you screen healthy people for an illness, any illness, be it cancer or high blood pressure, diabetes, then you will be picking up borderline cases and overtreating them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Doctors are under pressure to deliver concrete answers to patients, but even something like a cancer diagnosis — which feels like it should be black or white, yes or no — requires interpretation.

    &lt;p&gt;With winter fast approaching, many of us have already been struck with runny noses, dry coughs and fevers. Right now, chances are these symptoms are caused by Covid, with levels of the pandemic-causing virus among the highest they have been all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the scientists explain exactly why Covid is on the rise again and, vitally, how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do so many people have Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infection rates always go up because of one of three reasons,” says Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s either because immunity to Covid among the population has fallen; a new and more infectious variant is spreading; or behaviour has changed in a way that increases the risk of exposure to the virus, he explains. All three factors are currently at play, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The new ‘Stratus’ variant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;XFG, a sub-variant of the once infamous Omicron, was first &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; in January. This strain of the virus, which has been nicknamed Stratus, is currently responsible for the majority of Covid cases in the UK and has two main variants – XFG and XFG.3. The former is responsible for 38.3 per cent of UK Covid cases and the latter 32.8 per cent, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stratus” is also responsible for over 60 per cent of Covid cases globally, according to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/summary"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is actively monitoring the variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has become dominant because it is more infectious (able to bypass existing immunity to some degree) than prior variants,” explains Prof Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But its relative growth advantage is only about 31 per cent, which is not great compared to many previous variants,” he notes. For comparison, the Omicron variant, which caused chaos when it swept the world in late 2021, had a growth advantage of around 200 per cent when it emerged. “So it will be contributing to the growth in cases but I suspect not the main driver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Covid infections are now asymptomatic in many people, there have been reports that an XFG infection may be more likely to cause a hoarse, scratchy or raspy voice. Other common symptoms are still a cough, fever and change of taste or smell, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen the comments on hoarseness but given we see and diagnose such a small proportion of infections now and then usually only the more severe cases, I am not convinced,” Prof Hunter says. “Also adenoviruses [a cause of the common cold] are almost as common in lab tests and they do cause hoarseness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Immunity against Covid is low&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid cases are no longer being tracked as thoroughly as they were during the pandemic, when tests were dished out for free. However, monitoring shows that cases are currently at their highest level this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures, compiled by the UKHSA, show that around nine per cent of all Covid tests taken in the week to &lt;strong&gt;September 7&lt;/strong&gt; were positive, which is the highest level seen since last November. The figures show that 10.8 per cent of people tested in GP practices were infected, while 8.9 per cent of swabs among hospital patients were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reporting rates have been around base levels for almost a year now and so population immunity will be relatively low,” Prof Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming infected with Covid, the immune system develops antibodies against it. These are fighter cells that recognise and neutralise the virus when the body comes into contact with it again. “Immunity to infection probably lasts only a few months on average,” Prof Hunter notes, after which point the body is once again vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that is probably the major factor,” fuelling the current upward trend in infections, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Schools reopening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools reopening earlier this month could further encourage the spread of the virus, notes Prof Peter Openshaw, a respiratory physician and mucosal immunologist at Imperial College London. This could mean that, by October, cases are even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that during October we’re going to be seeing a lot more Covid around,” he says. “There was quite a peak in October 2024 and then it settled around Christmas time and was replaced by influenza. It could be that we’re going to see more cases but I think we’ll have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big question is how high will reporting levels go and when they will peak,” Prof Hunter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to avoid it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of isolating yourself at home, there’s unfortunately no magic bullet that will guarantee that you won’t catch Covid or other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regular hand washing and sanitising communal surfaces, such as trays on aeroplanes and trays, as well as gym equipment can reduce your risk of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us, the need to avoid infection is not as great as we will have had multiple infections by now and most infections are asymptomatic,” Prof Hunter says. “On average in England, we will have had about four infections each by now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older and medically vulnerable people should remain more cautious, he says. “Wear masks if in crowded environments, accept the offer of a vaccine if made and discourage visits from people who are suffering from a respiratory infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid autumn vaccination booster programme launches on October 1. Care home residents, over-75s and anyone aged over six months who is immunocompromised is eligible for the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines that are on offer are extraordinarily effective,” Prof Openshaw says. “If you’re offered a vaccine, I would definitely take it and I personally have taken every offer of the vaccines I’ve been made.” The jab can reduce the likelihood of outbreaks and prevent the virus from causing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What to do if you get Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the most effective way to get over Covid is to rest at home and drink plenty of fluids and remain vigilant for worsening symptoms,” says Dr Adrian Hayter, medical director for clinical policy at the Royal College of General Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the counter medications – paracetamol or ibuprofen – can help alleviate symptoms such as aches, a sore throat or a blocked nose, and increasing airflow by sitting upright and breathing slowly can help with feelings of breathlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small group of people remain eligible for antivirals, which are medicines that stop Covid from growing and spreading through the body, including those who have certain immune conditions, blood disorders or receiving specific cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone has concerns for their health, or if their condition is getting worse or not improving, they should seek health advice to determine whether further treatment is needed,” Dr Hayter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises people with Covid symptoms to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for at least three days, while the infected should steer clear of people who have a weak immune system for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The condition is highly infectious, and some people can be particularly vulnerable to the worst effects, which is why it’s important that we take appropriate measures to avoid transmission,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Penn Medicine have identified specific brain circuits that are impacted by psilocybin—the active compound found in some psychedelic mushrooms—which could lead to new paths forward for pain and mental health management options.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain affects more than 1.5 billion people worldwide and is often deeply entangled with depression and anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that amplifies suffering and impairs quality of life. The study from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania—published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;—offers new insight into ways to disrupt this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As an anesthesiologist, I frequently care for people undergoing surgery who suffer from both chronic pain and depression. In many cases, they're not sure which condition came first, but often, one makes the other worse," said Joseph Cichon, MD, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at Penn and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This new study offers hope. These findings open the door to developing new, non-opioid, non-addictive therapies as psilocybin and related psychedelics are not considered addictive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting the brain's pain and mood hub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studies using mice with chronic nerve injury and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory pain&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that a single dose of psilocybin reduced both pain and pain-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, with those benefits lasting almost two weeks. Psilocybin acts by gently activating specific brain signals, called serotonin receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT1A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike other drugs that fully turn these signals on or off, psilocybin acts more like a dimmer switch, turning it to just the right level," said Cichon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pinpoint where the effects originated, researchers injected psilocin—the active substance into which the body converts psilocybin—into different regions of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used advanced fluorescent microscopy, a technique that uses glowing dyes to see and capture neuronal activity, to see chronic pain neurons spontaneously firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When psilocin was injected directly into the prefrontal cortex of the brain, specifically the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anterior+cingulate+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; (ACC), a part of the brain that processes pain and emotions, it provided the same &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pain+relief/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; and mood improvements as when psilocybin was given to the whole body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also injected psilocin into the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spinal+cord/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't have the same calming effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Psilocybin may offer meaningful relief for patients by bypassing the site of injury altogether and instead modulating brain circuits that process pain, while lifting the ones that help you feel better, giving you relief from both pain and low mood at the same time," said Cichon.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Results can drive future psilocybin research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the findings from this study could also inform therapies for other conditions involving dysregulated brain circuits, such as addiction or post-traumatic stress disorder. Cichon adds that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In my anesthesiology practice, I often see that both pain and mood symptoms can worsen following surgery due to the physiological and psychological stress imposed by the procedure. While psilocybin shows promise as a treatment for both pain and depression, it remains uncertain whether such therapies would be safe, effective, or feasible in the context of surgery and anesthesia," adds Cichon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penn team plans to investigate optimal dosing strategies, long-term effects, and the ability of the brain to rewire itself in sustaining these benefits in rodent models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While these findings are encouraging, we don't know how long-lived &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psilocybin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;'s effects are or how multiple doses might be needed to adjust brain pathways involved in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; for a longer-lasting solution," adds Stephen Wisser, co-author and a Penn Neuroscience Ph.D. student in Cichon's lab.&lt;/p&gt;

                Sleeping in an awkward position for many hours at night can cause morning aches and pains. One way to guard against them is to focus on your sleep posture, say medical experts.

   &lt;p&gt;Ever wake up with a sore lower back or achy shoulders that just ruin the rest of your day? Or get up from bed and try to greet the morning, only to find your neck is too stiff to turn to the window?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morning muscle pain along your spine is often the result of hours of improper support while sleeping, says &lt;a href="https://restorativesleepmedicine.com/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ellen Wermter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a nurse practitioner who runs &lt;a href="https://restorativesleepmedicine.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Restorative Sleep Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep clinic in Virginia. One easy way to guard against it, say medical experts, is to focus on your sleep posture.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Sleeping in an awkward position tends to create gaps between your body and your pillow or mattress, Wermter says. "Your soft tissue is going to want to sag into those gaps, and the muscles tense to make up for that" in order to protect against potential injury.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of a night, that muscle tension can cause inflammation and pain, Wermter says — and bad sleep from all that tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether you sleep on your back, side or stomach, experts share advice for those looking to minimize morning aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Sleep the same way you stand &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91427" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                When you sleep the way you stand, it reduces the possibility of muscle strain, says &lt;a href="https://restorativesleepmedicine.com/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;Ellen Wermter&lt;/a&gt;, a nurse practitioner who runs &lt;a href="https://restorativesleepmedicine.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Restorative Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep clinic in Virginia. This illustration offers guidance on how to sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of your spine.

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The best defense against an achy neck or back&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the morning is to sleep just like you stand, Wermter says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When you sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of your spine, it reduces the possibility of muscle strain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While lying down, your body should form a straight line from the top of your head to your tailbone. Wermter suggests placing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;your ears over your shoulders and your shoulders over your hips. Point&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;your chin straight ahead, not tucked into your chest or stretched up toward the sky. Aim for symmetry with your arms for proper circulation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you're a back sleeper, this tip will be easier to follow. But if you're a side or stomach sleeper, you may need to adjust your sleep space for better spinal alignment — or even train yourself to sleep in this position, Wermter says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Avoid sleeping on your stomach &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While this position can open up airways for struggling snorers, it's often associated with its potential downsides, Wermter says. That includes neck, back and shoulder aches, and fragmented sleep from switching positions more often throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When you sleep on your stomach, it's easy to overextend your neck, she says. Creating breathing room for yourself often pulls your neck out of that ideal spinal alignment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91451" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pillow height, or loft, is important to maintaining proper sleep posture and preventing neck pain. &lt;strong&gt;The left column&lt;/strong&gt; shows improper pillow height for back sleepers, side sleepers and stomach sleepers, respectively. &lt;strong&gt;The right column&lt;/strong&gt; demonstrates the proper pillow height for a neutral spine for each sleeping position.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Choose the right pillow for your head  &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's important to rest your head on something that supports your spine and promotes maximum restfulness at night, says &lt;a href="https://fabianmorales.com/meet-fabian" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Fabian Morales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine physician.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back sleepers: &lt;/strong&gt;Morales suggests a pillow with medium firmness and loft, or something with an ergonomic design. "A good orthopedic pillow designed to support the curvature of the neck can minimize your risk of neck pain down the line. It reduces pressure on the neck and supports alignment," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side sleepers: &lt;/strong&gt;To find a pillow with the right loft for side sleeping, "measure from the bend of your neck to the edge of your shoulder," Wermter says. The ideal pillow will support your head without pushing your head and neck further up.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomach sleepers:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're stuck on stomach sleeping, Wermter says it might be best to go without a pillow to avoid extra strain on your neck. If you do need some cushion, aim for low-loft options to keep your spine aligned.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Replace your pillows every few years or as soon as you notice your pillow starts to lack support, Morales says. Pillows hold on to dirt and dust — and they lose their structure over time, which can lead to aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Support any gaps with smaller pillows &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91429" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;
            
&lt;div class="credit-caption"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Pillows can be used to support proper sleep posture for back sleepers, side sleepers and stomach sleepers.
                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When your spine isn't properly supported, pain is likely to follow, Wermter says. That's why it's important to align and cradle the entire length of your spine — not just your head and neck — to make up for any gaps between your body and the mattress. Use smaller pillows or even rolled up blankets or towels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back sleepers:&lt;/strong&gt; Be mindful of any gaps at the small of your back or under your knees, which can be a source of lower back pain. Add support to those areas as needed, Wermter says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side sleepers: &lt;/strong&gt;Many side sleepers like placing a small pillow between the knees or hugging a body pillow to align the hips and reduce pressure in the hips and lower back, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomach sleepers:&lt;/strong&gt; Wermter says just sleeping on a flat surface is fine for stomach sleepers, but some may find that a thin pillow under the hips and stomach can reduce strain on the back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Opt for a mattress that's not too soft and not too firm &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Evaluate the quality of your mattress and replace your bed every seven years at most, says Wermter. If a mattress is too soft, the heavier parts of your body can sink and your spine will likely get out of alignment. If a mattress is too firm, it can create those pain-inducing gaps between body and bed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Try other pain relief remedies &lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What should you do if you have a great sleep setup and you still wake up with an achy back or a crick in your neck?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a very common experience, especially as we age and our spines experience more wear and tear, says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1417115767/charla-r-fischer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Charla Fischer,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;orthopedic spine surgeon at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That kind of muscle pain can be, well, a pain in the neck — but is usually not cause for major concern. Consult a medical professional if you have consistent pain for a week or more; experience numbness, tingling or weakness in the neck, arms or hands; or if you just have concerns, Fischer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, don't forget the power of basic pain relief remedies. Take &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5254350/advil-tylenol-which-painkiller-take-when" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, massage the area, do gentle stretches, or place ice or heating packs in 20- to 30-minute bouts on your body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Don't underestimate the power of a hot shower, she says. "It can go a long way in calming down those unhappy muscles."&lt;/p&gt;
