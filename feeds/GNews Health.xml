Shaker cup in hand, a classmate extolled the virtues of the supplement, promising that a tiny scoop of powder taken daily would make us both “superjacked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The unscientific advice fit into a broader &lt;i&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/i&gt;-mentality of the time. Creatine was an accessory as vital to the lifestyle as tanning beds or wearing two polo shirts at the same time. Culturally, the supplement is only recently shedding that alignment with bro culture, in part because of changing ideas around body image and muscle mass, but also because of a renewed interest online in the benefits of creatine for both physical and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine became popular in the early nineties with the discovery that top Olympics athletes were using the supplement at the Barcelona games. Since that time, it’s been called one of the most researched &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/"&gt;supplements in the world&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 500 peer-reviewed publications evaluating its effects on the body according to PubMed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A 2021 review from the &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w"&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; noted that the use of creatine resulted in less muscle damage, inflammation and muscle soreness in response to training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;We’re also starting to see promising research about creatine and cognitive benefits. A 2023 study pointed toward the supplement’s potential in treating memory loss and even Alzheimer’s (though for the latter, human trials are still forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Fitting creatine into your daily routine is simple and inexpensive. Here is a breakdown of the supplement and why you may want to try it, even if you don’t regularly go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is creatine and what does it do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is a substance we all produce naturally. It’s also found in meat and seafood. Supplementing our natural creatine aides in the recovery process for our muscles, helping to increase mass and strength. Practically, that means lifting heavier things for more reps. A 2019 study from the Journal of Clinical Medicine spoke about how the supplement can also assist in maintaining muscle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/"&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;, decreasing the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“It’s something that I like to talk about with my clients because it’s an easy benefit toward their goals, whether that’s body composition or just feeling better in their bodies,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremy.fernandes6/"&gt;Jeremy Fernandes&lt;/a&gt;, a health coach with &lt;a href="https://procoach.app/jeremy-fernandes?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZPatIm6IbdrWw3iB-L2nRzJ9SZX_yFgHNETEkrihA2iWhgDnWLCDVGcyo_aem_mJyav96s7Ow5MkLW-tkMNA"&gt;Precision Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “It lets us do more high intensity work and add additional volume to that intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While creatine has definitely improved my workouts, I’ve also found it helpful with concentration and brain fog. A review from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556518300263?via%3Dihub"&gt;Experimental Gerontology&lt;/a&gt; touted the supplement’s cognitive benefits, showing improvements in overall memory and potential improvements in brain function during stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“There does seem to be some benefit for memory recall in stressful environments,” Fernandes said. “It’s been shown to be specifically helpful in situations that are highly cognitively stressful, or where sleep deprivation is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The effects of creatine on women’s health are less studied than its impact on men. But a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7998865/"&gt; 2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; showed use by premenopausal females was effective for improving strength and exercise performance. Many postmenopausal females also experienced benefits, particularly in relation to skeletal muscle size and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to use creatine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Most commercial creatine comes in a powder you can add to water, juice or a shake. When starting out the goal is to saturate your muscles; that’s how you’ll start seeing the most benefits. To do that you can “load” by taking 20 grams a day for a week. If you’re fine waiting a little longer to get results, take three to five grams daily for about a month. The maintenance dose after that is also three to five grams daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Compared with many other supplements, it’s affordable. A five-gram dose runs between 35 and 70 cents depending on the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does creatine (unfairly) get a bad rap?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is sometimes conflated with steroids because the supplement has been associated with increased strength and muscle growth. While creatine is effective for gains, it does not produce results anywhere near the rate of testosterone or anabolics. Creatine is also safe to use as long as your kidneys are working fine. The major side effects when starting out are potential gas and bloating, which reduces with use. Most people hesitant to use creatine avoid it because they’re worried about looking bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“The question that comes up often is … ‘Won’t I just gain a bunch of weight, gain a bunch of water or get really bulky?’” says Toronto based trainer and nutrition coach &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/coachmegs.me/"&gt;Megan&lt;/a&gt; Dancey. “But it can aid in attacking our fitness routines a little bit better and get us into an environment where we can then get the results we want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Dancy has suggested clients use creatine as part of a supplementation routine. When included in a well-rounded plan, it can have huge benefits toward body composition, recovery and mental alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you’re exploring different supplements to help you in your fitness routine, it hits the top of my list along with protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYlJYS0tVRVNEemZaZWtFUlJheTV1Tl9oUFJLTXRkS2pvTi1aQkM5eWJsTm50SGpoUi05ZC0zUkhlZHp0WkUyYUN3OWk0NnRuX3BlSEl5N1ZkdXZvMmliRE5NVF9XanA3UjFkbjJJdEMzTFliREdOY0tJS195cklFZmNMQjZCS09Gay1kbTBQWmw3alA3SzU0WTlrb1Z2eGxNa0JVLXJnREhfWnk2Z2Ffbzg2ekFNd2Z1aUZ3</guid></item><item><title>7 disadvantages of drinking too much water - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;Benefits of chewing paan leaves after me...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 reasons to start the day with 5 round...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>My Neighbors Have a Terrible Relationship.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="5" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ckj7r003w3b72jmywrxqv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear How to Do It,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu41001b3b724v5utygi@published"&gt;I live next to a nerdy early 30s guy, Kris, and his younger jock boyfriend, Karl. At first, I didn’t think much of them, but over the past few weeks, their relationship has turned into a total soap opera. Karl is this tall, muscular, macho dude. Kris is a great guy, but from what I can overhear, Karl treats him like garbage. They’re constantly arguing, and Karl has started bringing another guy over for loud, obnoxious sex almost every night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu8x001c3b72qsl1s2fn@published"&gt;I have always considered myself straight. But lately … something’s changed. Hearing them has started to turn me on. I know it’s wrong, and I know I shouldn’t be getting involved, but I can’t stop thinking about it. The idea of Karl hearing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; with Kris is driving me crazy. I know it’s messed up, but the thought of “cucking” Karl, this super-masculine guy who seems to think he’s untouchable, is weirdly thrilling to me. Kris and I have flirted a few times in the hallway, and I know he likes me. I’m sure he’d be game.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceudt001d3b72mbhmi6tu@published"&gt;There’s something about Karl’s arrogant confidence, his total dominance, that’s making me feel things I don’t understand. And the idea of getting one over on him by being with Kris is just … I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I hear them, the more obsessed I become with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuir001e3b72rc3kxkic@published"&gt;I know I shouldn’t get involved, but the temptation is overwhelming. What should I do? Is this just some weird fantasy I need to get out of my system, or is there something deeper going on here? I’ve never felt this way before, and it’s freaking me out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuxf001h3b72zdch5evo@published"&gt;You’re right, you should not be getting involved. Inserting yourself (literally) into a soap opera will likely only beget more drama. Given the volatility of the Kris-Karl dynamic, and your suspicion that Karl is mistreating Kris, consider a possible outcome of you having sex with Kris: more mistreatment. Even worse, the scenario you envision is one in which Karl &lt;em&gt;hears&lt;/em&gt; you with Kris, which implies at least the possibility that you want to do this without Karl’s knowledge or consent ahead of time. Do you think someone who is already shitty to his boyfriend will take hearing his boyfriend get railed a wall away in stride? It’s possible, but the risks are great.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev2a001i3b7248ngc4bo@published"&gt;The fact is that you do not know the terms of these dudes’ arrangement. Whether it seems fair or not, they may have a rule where only Karl gets to have outside sex. They may both need to be present. Maybe Kris isn’t allowed to bottom for anyone besides Karl. You would have to navigate the terms of their openness (if they are in fact open, which seems likely but is also unclear) with both of them in order for this to be ethical. You can’t cuck Karl without Karl’s consent, and if he is into it then you’d kind of be doing him a favor no matter how much you tear into Kris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev7a001j3b72yn2xb6ey@published"&gt;I say let this Kris-Karl cuck concept exist as a fantasy. If you’re curious about guys for real, there are plenty of gay couples who would gladly have a straight dude over to plow one or both of them. Go on a hook-up app, label yourself as a straight guy who wants to cuck a gay couple and watch the requests pour in.&lt;/p&gt;

One morning last week, I cut my hand while doing dishes at my girlfriend’s house. It was a small cut, so I called her while she was at work to ask if she had some Band-Aids. She told me they were in the bottom left side drawer of the bathroom vanity. There, on top of the box of Band-Aids, was a tube of vaginal itch cream (Vagisil). I put it back and checked the next day when getting another Band-Aid, and the tube had been turned. I checked the next day and it had been moved again. Same thing the following day. It seemed like she was using it on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszr00283b72diejt7ba@published"&gt;This wouldn’t normally be a concern, but after going for years without a case of jock itch, I have had two recent cases. A prescription from my doctor cleared it up, but it got me thinking: Am I “catching” something from her? We are exclusive, so we no longer use condoms. Should I be concerned about catching (I couldn’t think of a better term) something more serious? Is there reason to be alarmed she uses this stuff everyday? If there is a concern, how do I bring it up to her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002b3b722mkmsth5@published"&gt;It’s very difficult to say for sure what’s going on in the absence of a known diagnosis for your girlfriend. But here are a few things we do know: Jock itch is absolutely contagious and can be contracted &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/men/causes-and-prevent-jock-itch"&gt;via skin-to-skin contact&lt;/a&gt;, including during sex. Jock itch is caused by a fungus (tinea cruris). &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/product/regular-strength-anti-itch-creme"&gt;Vagisil, in its original-recipe form&lt;/a&gt;, is not an antifungal medication. Its main active ingredient is benzocaine, an anesthetic. If your girlfriend has jock itch, Vagisil may alleviate the pain, but it won’t clear it up. However, Vagisil does make &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/products/yeast-infection-treatment"&gt;a line of yeast-infection treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain miconazole nitrate, an antifungal that &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618061.html"&gt;used to treat jock itch&lt;/a&gt; as well. (The fungus that causes yeast infections is Candida, typically Candida albicans. It can also itch and may result in a cottage cheese-like discharge.) My guess is that she’s using the plain, old anti-itch version to alleviate her pain without actually getting rid of the fungus. So the fungus persists and so does pain, which leads to further Vagisil use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002c3b72a8z6hcza@published"&gt;So yes, the jock itch may have been transmitted from her to you. But, as you can see, this is something that is cleared up easily. I think it’s quite reasonable to tell your girlfriend, “Look, I had jock itch twice and I noticed that you have been using Vagisil. Do you think maybe you have jock itch, too?” If she isn’t already using an antifungal, then giving her this heads up will help mitigate her pain and allow her body to recover. As her boyfriend, you should be so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002d3b72inaz3hzz@published"&gt;Should you be concerned about something more serious? I mean, not based on the fact that your girlfriend may have jock itch alone, but sure, transmission is a possibility with partners. Viruses like HPV and herpes may be dormant or totally asymptomatic. When you’re having sex with someone, there’s always the risk of bacterial infections like syphilis and gonorrhea as well. Even in theoretically monogamous arrangements, sometimes people cheat, which can lead to infection risk. Trust is going to be key here, but I really don’t think a persistent case of jock itch is a good cause to become distrustful. Truly not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002f3b725xuji8kk@published"&gt;I’m a 31-year-old gay man who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1: genital herpes caused by the cold sore virus. I honestly had no idea that you could get genital herpes by receiving oral sex from someone who has ever had a cold sore on their mouth (even if they don’t have one when you hook up).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002g3b72uk0mo97g@published"&gt;My doctor told me that I don’t need to “walk around with a red H on my chest” and said that he does not think it’s necessary to tell sexual partners that I have HSV-1. He said that the risk of transmission is very low without symptoms, and that I just got very unlucky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002h3b72p8jqnn4a@published"&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about this, because there is technically a small risk of transmission. Unlike with HIV, you can’t take medication to prevent getting herpes, and taking herpes antivirals cannot suppress the virus to undetectable levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002i3b72k2p3p58y@published"&gt;I was recently chatting with a guy on Scruff for a couple days. Once the conversation turned towards meeting up, I told him that I had GHSV-1, that the risk of transmission was very low but not zero, and to feel free to read about it and let me know if he had any questions. He flipped out at me and said I wasted his time, and blocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002j3b72e42b9r2q@published"&gt;I feel pretty down after this experience. Most people already have HSV-1 and have antibodies to it. But I feel like the stigma is too great to not tell this to sexual partners. At the same time, I sincerely doubt that anyone with cold sores on their mouth is telling sexual partners they could give them genital herpes. So, am I just making this way harder on myself than I need to by being honest?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002m3b72vbnk1mll@published"&gt;There is no real easy answer to this, as your letter suggests. If you think about the man-on-man hook-up app ecosystem, it is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; rare for people to disclose any kind of herpes upfront, by which I mean in their profiles. It’s probably a bit more common in private chats, but still unusual, at least in my anecdotal experience. I can think of one or two guys who have mentioned it, out of what must be thousands that I’ve talked to through the years. It’s not like HIV in that respect, where there are plenty of guys who note their status in their profiles. Also, while inconvenient, sometimes painful, and occasionally responsible for complications, herpes is nowhere nearly as serious as HIV. You’re right, valacyclovir isn’t a magic bullet (though it does &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14702423/"&gt;significantly reduce the risk of transmission&lt;/a&gt;), but a key difference here is that if you don’t take herpes antiretrovirals, herpes in all likelihood isn’t going to kill you. The same cannot be said for HIV in the vast majority of cases. Herpes stigma is high, but its actual stakes on quality of life are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="189" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002n3b72xtsgqt41@published"&gt;Given the cultural vibe, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by being honest (no one said that being ethical is easy!) You say it yourself in your letter: You feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about your herpes. And so, you should do what you think is right. For a lot of guys, the risk of contracting herpes is implicit and that’s why they don’t talk about it. Group/public sex is a major feature of modern urban gay culture, and in the age of PrEP, this activity is often done without physical barriers like condoms. I’ve never been to a sex party where I’ve heard the guys discussing their HSV or HPV status. It is assumed that possible contraction of these viruses, if it hasn’t happened already, goes with the territory. That doesn’t mean you need to fall into lockstep with the prevailing laissez faire attitudes of gay hook-up culture. You can be different and disclose and shoulder the rejection that may come with it. I bet you’ll encounter guys, unlike your Scruff near miss, who don’t care and will hook up with you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszu002o3b72g83nne3b@published"&gt;Just one thing to keep in mind, though: According to herpes expert Anna Wald, a doctor and professor of medicine and epidemiology at University of Washington School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/boyfriend-girlfriend-third-rules-relationship-questions.html"&gt;whom I have interviewed before for this column&lt;/a&gt;, “Transmission from genital HSV-1 is unusual, because genital HSV-1 does not reactivate very often.” So you’d be disclosing a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slight amount of risk. If that helps you sleep at night, though, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

Another cat linked to Savage was diagnosed last month with H5N1, the medical designation for the disease, and had similar symptoms. A third city cat also linked to Savage products likely had bird flu but survived and it’s now too late to test for the infection, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savage co-founder Audrey Brady said the company was notified of the issue in February. In a statement she said “we are incredibly saddened” by the deaths and added the company issued a recall notice on February 17 after a customer in Colorado reported their cat had fallen ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The product in question was then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing,” she said. “As a precautionary measure for our consumers, we initiated a market withdrawal while awaiting final test results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company and city officials said the poultry in question was part of a specific lot, code 11152026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered&lt;/a&gt; several live poultry markets in New York City to shut down temporarily last month, following several previous detections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials urged pet owners to keep cats indoors and to steer dogs clear of any dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caroline Lewis contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQbHIyTmNkR25rVW1ZM0xHT0JMb2YxNUhua0hra2EzWXd6UEZuNUJrOS13eDk1MEVtemdaaVQxSDFSMEFNVVlFanM4Q3RWMnZNNmRBckRONXFVa1FtekJLWDZPb1NUbWNvcHlNc2ZNcjhKUnlJeHBRbk5oak9GOVk5WE5NZklnNTIwUWdOU0ZkZUdsb2pEdU84a25HaFdfUGRpSUlUSVR3UWtIaTA</guid></item><item><title>I had just months to live after cancer diagnosis, the reason I'm still here should instil hope in everyone - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A father-of-one who had just months to live after being diagnosed with America's most common &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4324d380-fb7f-11ef-866b-07b6fc3248df"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been cured thanks to an experimental treatment he received in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mexico/index.html" id="mol-0ca6d880-fb93-11ef-89c8-4b52ae29f609" class=""&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May 2023, Allen Rapert, now 62, was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma — a type of&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13352967/How-does-melanoma-cancer-treatment-vaccine-work.html"&gt; skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; — that affects about 1million people in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said the cancer was stage four, with a tennis ball-sized tumor below his eye that had eaten through his skull bone and was growing quickly into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommended surgery to cut out most of the tissue on the right side of his face, his nose and his right eye ball, which would have left him permanently disfigured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He would also have had to undergo a course of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even then, doctors said they were not sure the cancer would be cured — with &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31587382/"&gt;studies suggesting&lt;/a&gt; only six percent of patients live four years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing for his life and appearance, Mr Rapert decided — after an online search — to skip the surgery and instead opt for an experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He went for five rounds of the treatment in Mexico, and was declared cancer-free just seven months after his diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Allen Rapert, who suffered with a stage four skin cancer that formed a tennis ball-sized tumor under his right eye.

That is my experience and that is how we have used them in studies with mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, why is it the case that with humans we test it intravenously? Why are we treating human patients differently?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, immunotherapy drugs tend to be administered into the blood stream and circulated around the body rather than directly into the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams says injecting them into the tumor would make them more effective, however, because it is more likely to show the immune system where the cancer is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Institute told DailyMail.com it has had an upwards of 85 percent success rate in treating advanced stage four cancers using its method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the third case of an advanced cancer being cleared by the Institute that DailyMail.com has reported, after a doctor&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13962537/scientist-cured-pancreatic-experimental-treatment.html"&gt; reversed his stage four pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; in six months after being treated at the Institute and a professor &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988951/florida-mother-terminal-breast-cancer-revolutionary-treatment.html"&gt;reversed her stage four breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rapert is pictured above while receiving the treatment.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a way to feel more energized, focused, and less distracted during the day, the solution might be simpler than you think—&lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, you read that right. Starting your morning with a breakfast packed with 30 grams of protein can completely change how you feel throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Protein Should Be Part of Your Morning Routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know that protein plays a critical role in our health. It helps build muscles, repair tissues, and produce essential enzymes and hormones. But did you know that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/30-grams-of-protein-for-breakfast?fbclid=IwY2xjawJCAFxleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaQpE3TKma2VNkvUB4rRRrp62nphOg5TjUPk0SEvYyO3QXJwOrsXtDw7tA_aem_PcL9i5J6lqkFaorD8h3ESA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein is especially important for &lt;strong&gt;women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It helps regulate hormones like &lt;strong&gt;estrogen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;progesterone&lt;/strong&gt;, which are key to balancing mood and sleep cycles. A lack of protein can even disrupt hormonal levels, leading to fatigue, mood swings, and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein supports the body in building and repairing muscles, skin, and organs. It also helps in the production of enzymes and hormones that regulate metabolism and the immune system. Incorporating enough protein into your diet, particularly at breakfast, can ensure that you feel better and stay fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How I Upped My Protein Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I used to start my day with something light—a boiled egg. But that only gave me 7 grams of protein, which is far from ideal. After realizing how important it was to have a more balanced meal, I decided to switch things up. Here’s how I now make sure to hit 30 grams every morning:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omelet&lt;/strong&gt; made with three eggs, a cup of &lt;strong&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, and a side of &lt;strong&gt;avocado&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tomatoes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cucumbers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-fat Greek yogurt&lt;/strong&gt; with flaxseeds, organic berries, and a tablespoon of &lt;strong&gt;almond butter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A delicious recipe: &lt;strong&gt;rolled oats&lt;/strong&gt; boiled in unsweetened &lt;strong&gt;almond milk&lt;/strong&gt;, mashed with half a banana, and topped with cinnamon, berries, and &lt;strong&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these options gives me the protein boost I need to start the day strong. The oats with cottage cheese, although initially unconventional, became a surprise favorite after I tried it. The sweet and salty flavor combination is actually quite delightful!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Impact of a Protein-Packed Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results? Nothing short of amazing. From day one, I noticed a boost in &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt;. No more mid-morning slumps or distractions from hunger. With 30 grams of protein in the morning, I’m fueled for several hours without feeling the urge to snack constantly. Plus, the clarity and &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve experienced at work have been remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Eating a protein-rich breakfast isn’t just about keeping hunger at bay; it also brings a sense of calm into my day. The &lt;strong&gt;peace of mind&lt;/strong&gt; I now have when tackling tasks at work has been transformative. Rather than worrying about when my next snack will be, I can stay present and engaged throughout the morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Protein is Especially Important for Women&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein is crucial for regulating hormones like &lt;strong&gt;estrogen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;progesterone&lt;/strong&gt;, two hormones that influence everything from mood to sleep. For women, protein can also help balance these hormones, keeping things in check, which is vital for overall well-being. Insufficient protein intake can lead to hormonal imbalances, leaving you feeling fatigued, moody, or even more prone to cravings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keeping Protein in Your Routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat at breakfast—it’s about making protein a staple of your routine. By ensuring that you get between &lt;strong&gt;28 and 32 grams of protein&lt;/strong&gt; each morning, your body will benefit from increased &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;calm&lt;/strong&gt; that lasts well into the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

CHANAKARN LAOSARAKHAM/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorazepam, a common anti-anxiety medication, makes frequent appearances in Season 3 of “The White Lotus” on HBO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This type of benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and certain types of insomnia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The drug slows activity in the brain, promoting physical relaxation and reducing anxious thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorazepam has the potential for dependence and may cause life threatening problems when used with opioid medications, alcohol, and certain illegal drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;HBO’s third season of “&lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-white-lotus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;” is underway. A mostly new cast of guests flock to Thailand’s Koh Samui to stay at the show’s namesake luxury spa and wellness sanctuary. Here, spirituality and a possible whodunnit are served up to loyal fans of the beloved comedy-drama series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season begins similarly to others, with plenty of intrigue, leaving behind a string of mysteries about who died and how. The show opened with gunshots and a dead body, this time floating face down in a lotus pond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As storylines are introduced, a surprising theme running throughout this season is the frequent mention of lorazepam, a prescription medication used to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-treatment" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;treat anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and certain types of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria Ratliff, played by Parker Posey, whose Southern drawl brings a distinctive ring to the word “lorazepam,” can’t seem to get through the day without popping these anti-anxiety pills like candy, sometimes downing them with white wine at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her overuse of the pills leaves her slurring her words, zoning out, and dozing off at the dinner table. At one point in episode 4 (which was released on March 9), Victoria’s daughter Piper exclaims, “You don’t have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Victoria’s husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. While attending a yacht party with their three children, he steals Victoria’s prescription bottle from her bag, drinks a few glasses of what looks like whiskey and becomes incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about this drug and whether it’s safe for anxiety, read on. We’ll break down how the drug is meant to be used, the main risks, and other ways to manage your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/lorazepam-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is the generic name for the prescription medication Ativan. It belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bipolar-disorder/benzodiazepines" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;benzodiazepines&lt;/a&gt;, which also include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xanax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halcion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Klonopin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lorazepam is a commonly prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-drugs" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;medication for anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also used to treat panic attacks and can be used for insomnia,” said &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/psychiatry/ca/santa-monica/david-merrill-1902923410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;David Merrill&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug works by slowing the activity in the brain, which promotes relaxation in the body and a reduction in anxious thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “the first-line treatment [for anxiety] is typically antidepressants like SSRIs [antidepressants], plus &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/talk-therapy/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;,” Merrill told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; or mindfulness-based stress reduction — where you get a better understanding of what’s driving your anxieties and how to manage the anxiety when it comes up, versus just popping a pill like is done on a TV show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/internal-medicine/ca/tustin/victoria-leigh-1619372265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Victoria L. Leigh&lt;/a&gt;, DO, FACOI, an internal medicine specialist with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, CA, said in certain cases, benzodiazepines may be used first, such as with anxiety experienced by cancer patients and hospice or palliative care patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. These are a normal part of the body’s stress response, said Merrill, not something that is dangerous or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you learn how to counteract those sensations when they come up, whether by taking a deep breath or taking a break from what you are doing, you can keep them from becoming a full-blown panic attack,” Merrill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can manage their anxiety without medication, using therapy alone. However, “with more severe cases of anxiety, we see the best outcomes with a combination of meds and therapy, at least over the short-term,” Merrill noted. “Then sometimes people can taper off the medications when their anxiety is under better control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used as prescribed, lorazepam can cause the following side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;drowsiness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unsteadiness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;diarrhea or constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;appetite changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restlessness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;changes in sex drive or ability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More serious problems, such as life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma, can occur if lorazepam is used alongside &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/opioids-and-related-disorders" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;opioid medications&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/codeine-vs-hydrocodone" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;codeine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/oxycodone-vs-oxycontin" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;oxycodone&lt;/a&gt;, and tramadol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol or using certain illegal drugs alongside lorazepam can also increase these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are using illegal drugs or other substances should not use lorazepam. People with a history of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/alcohol" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol dependence&lt;/a&gt; or abuse should not use lorazepam unless recommended by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because lorazepam is short-acting, its onset is faster, making &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/is-addiction-a-mental-illness" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; more likely,” Leigh told Healthline. In addition, “withdrawals from this medication are more abrupt than the longer-acting medications in this family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once dependence occurs, “if lorazepam is stopped suddenly, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/withdraw-from-benzodiazepines/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can lead to seizures, altered [thoughts], and can be fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines can cause &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;physical dependence&lt;/a&gt; and withdrawal symptoms, even when taken as directed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend upon the dose you are taking, how long you’ve been taking the drug, other sedating drugs you are taking, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;agitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;poor memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;panic attacks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;muscle fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tremor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;seizures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill said other signs of lorazepam dependence include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;needing to fill your prescription early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using the drug above the amounts or more often than recommended by your doctor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;having to use someone else’s pills because you ran out early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using the drug alongside alcohol in order to manage your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-symptoms" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;neglecting your responsibilities at work or in your personal life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing physical dependence or if you had withdrawal symptoms when you tried to stop taking lorazepam, ask your doctor about tapering your dose. Tapering means taking smaller doses over the course of a few or several weeks until you can safely stop the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many non-medication options have been shown to help relieve anxiety symptoms. Some of these may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-exercises" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also help to balance the ‘&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;fight or flight&lt;/a&gt;’ nervous system response that drives anxiety-related feelings,” said Leigh. “Reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; and focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/balanced-diet" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; can also impact the ‘gut-brain axis’ and can improve mental health as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the nervous system controls unconscious processes such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. It’s also in charge of keeping us safe through the body’s fight, flight, fawn and freeze responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the role of the nervous system really shifts the paradigm from ‘I’m broken,’ to seeing that your symptoms make sense when put into the context of basic biological needs, your past trauma history, and how that gets stored in your body,” said Armstrong, who is based near Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When viewed through the lens of the nervous system, anxiety symptoms are a survival response, one that makes sense in the context of the human body and a person’s current and past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors can also contribute to anxiety, such as sleep deprivation, being overstressed or over-caffeinated, suffering from micronutrient deficiencies, or lacking connection to other people and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, Armstrong teaches clients two types of tools for managing their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First are tools that people can use in the moment if they are feeling anxious or having a panic attack. This includes visual orienting (slowly looking around your space), biting into a lemon, and certain kinds of breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These help people move up what Armstrong refers to as the autonomic nervous system ladder — away from the sympathetic activation response (also known as fight or flight mode) toward a state of calm and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other group of tools helps reduce people’s anxiety symptoms long-term. Part of this proactive approach is helping people understand what might be contributing to their anxiety symptoms, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;past trauma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;current &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;life stressors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lifestyle habits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;micronutrient deficiencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;health conditions (i.e., &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hyperthyroidism" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;thyroid issues&lt;/a&gt; or hormone imbalance)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once clients have mapped out these factors, Armstrong asks: “What feels meaningful, and what feels accessible for you to take on right now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Armstrong said there’s a time and a place for the use of anti-anxiety medications, she empowers clients by educating them about how their bodies work and giving them tools to manage their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach can also pave the way for deeper &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/do-i-need-therapy/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;work with a therapist&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s talk therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/shadow-work/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;shadow work&lt;/a&gt;, or somatic parts (aka inner child) work. If the nervous system is well regulated, therapy is often more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, “the approach I use gives you an entire new framework for understanding yourself, and navigating your world and your symptoms in a way that is not associated with brokenness,” Armstrong told Healthline. “There’s also more space for compassion and curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Season 3 of the HBO series “The White Lotus,” some characters appear to pop lorazepam like candy. This prescription drug is used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia due to anxiety or situational stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective for treating both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. However, antidepressant SSRIs are more commonly used first because they have a lower risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam carries a risk of dependence and potential for misuse. This drug can also cause life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma when used alongside &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/opioids-list" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;opioid pain relievers&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol, or certain illegal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:20:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNVzRFcDNIMWRWYnZaR094QzBtejU1cGREV1pNSGZldGVSMUZHQ0lCNWhFYzF0ckh6Vk1JZHJjWE1ZemFIWmcwc2RuMlVDY3lHZ2NWV21nMGNldlI4d3JJZEtpbDU5SEV6Mzl4XzJwc29hbmtFUVdHLVkycklWaW9CVjhpRW1jV28</guid></item><item><title>Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For - Times Now</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_11eW" id="progressBarContainer_0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_2F9L _1WiC" id="119078362"&gt;&lt;div class="sBre _3NUG"&gt;&lt;div class="_3lDd"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-119078914,thumbsize-45840,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/119078914.jpg" alt="Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For" title="Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For"&gt;&lt;div class="_39Jh"&gt;&lt;div class="_24EZ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For (Image Credits: iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=" _2k5A _1_01"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_3XO4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, has been diagnosed with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/human-coronavirus-hku1"&gt;human coronavirus HKU1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (HCoV-HKU1) and is receiving treatment at a private hospital in South Kolkata. She had been suffering from a fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days, but doctors say her condition is stable. While this virus is not as well-known as COVID-19, it can still cause respiratory infections. Health experts say there is no need to panic, but it’s important to be aware of the symptoms and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Human Coronavirus HKU1?&lt;/h2&gt;Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) belongs to the Betacoronavirus family, the same group that includes the SARS and MERS viruses. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, HKU1 is generally associated with milder respiratory illnesses. The virus primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, causing symptoms similar to the common cold, though it can sometimes lead to more serious lung infections like pneumonia or bronchiolitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Human Coronavirus HKU1&lt;/h2&gt;Most cases of HCoV-HKU1 resemble regular flu-like illnesses and include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose or nasal

citizens, young children, and those with weakened immune systems may experience more severe complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who Is at Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;Though human coronavirus HKU1 is not as widely discussed as COVID-19, certain groups are more vulnerable to its effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Senior citizens (above 60).&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infants and young children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with chronic lung diseases such

class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does It Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;Like other respiratory viruses, human coronavirus HKU1 spreads through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Direct contact with infected respiratory droplets (e.g., coughing or sneezing)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth, or nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close contact with an infected person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Protect Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;While there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for human coronavirus HKU1, following basic hygiene and preventive measures can help reduce the risk of infection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Wear a mask in crowded or high-risk areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Avoid close contact with people showing symptoms of respiratory infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Sanitize frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs, mobile phones, and countertops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing to prevent droplet spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Boost immunity by eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Be Worried?&lt;/h2&gt;Doctors treating the Kolkata patient have assured that her infection is an isolated case and does not indicate an outbreak. While human coronavirus HKU1 is not new, it is rarely tested for because its symptoms closely resemble other seasonal respiratory infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news"&gt;Latest News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Now</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Potential Ozempic Rival That Could Help People Lose Weight With Less Nausea - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxNS0hfQ1JSZ2VfNkktX0s4azJXTlRBazRGc1VWc2xTZmdJODYxZ2tZSXRLWThwc3JSS0ZNYkI0OEVlb2pLWU4yWFlsR2FKWnY1QjZpVlZvSUtRS1R0cG5uNVJCV19UdUJjRUpKeFFjaHU0UkpnNEpsTlRoMGo1dGZUQ25vTVBxelpMOWw4M0tTelpzQzZfYmtZLWc0ZU93QWlNNnpmRXpNamlNVHdyRzQ1OWp0dUNpTmREWDI3MkZQdHB2UFJ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Wegovy, eat your heart out. In a new research paper, scientists say they’ve discovered a naturally occurring hormone that might help people lose weight while avoiding the side effects commonly associated with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Stanford Medicine conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Nature. With the help of artificial intelligence, the team identified a previously unknown peptide that appeared to safely reduce the appetite and weight of mice and miniature pigs without causing nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. More studies will be needed to verify the molecule’s safety and effectiveness in people, but the findings provide a tantalizing preview into what could be the future of obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emergence of semaglutide and similar drugs in recent years has been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;truly revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; for the field of obesity medicine. These medications, also used for type 2 diabetes, have proven to be far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone, with results ranging from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-super-ozempic-higher-dose-semaglutide-leads-to-even-greater-weight-loss-in-major-trial-2000551828"&gt;15% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; lost weight in clinical trials. Semaglutide works by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate our appetite and metabolism, among other functions (some drugs like tirzepatide mimic both GLP-1 and other related hormones).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As groundbreaking as these drugs are, they are known to commonly cause annoying GI symptoms, and may rarely cause more severe complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Scientists have also been working to find and develop newer generation drugs that could provide even greater weight loss or offer other conveniences, such as being available as a pill. In that vein, the Stanford Medicine researchers devised a novel strategy to find their drug candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many hormones in the body are activated only when their precursors are cleaved by specific enzymes. These precursors are called prohormones, and the family of enzymes that chop them up are called prohormone convertases. The researchers looked at one of these enzymes, prohormone convertase 1/3, which is known to help produce GLP-1. They decided to see if they could find other useful hunger-related hormones naturally produced by the enzyme. To greatly speed up this discovery process, they developed a computer algorithm (nicknamed Peptide Predictor) to narrow the list of potential molecules that fit their criteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This screening found an initial batch of 373 prohormones that could yield some 2,700 different peptides (peptides are often the building blocks of larger proteins, but they can have their own distinctive functions in the body). From there, the researchers tested 100 peptides they knew or suspected could affect the brain’s hunger drive (including GLP-1 for comparison). And ultimately, they identified one molecule that appeared to be particularly promising, a 12 amino acid-long peptide called BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The scientists then tested BRP on lab mice and miniature pigs (minipigs are thought to closely resemble people &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tox/20/3/20_3_125/_pdf"&gt;metabolically&lt;/a&gt;). They found that a single dose of BRP greatly reduced the appetite of both animals in the short term, sometimes by as much as 50%. And obese mice given BRP significantly lost weight over a two-week span, with most of this weight being stored fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that BRP’s hunger-reducing effects on the brain don’t involve the GLP-1 receptor at all, and it simply didn’t cause the animals to experience the GI symptoms commonly associated with Ozempic-like drugs. The dosed animals also didn’t experience changes to their movement, level of anxious behavior, or water intake, suggesting that BRP can be safely tolerated when taken as a drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues. That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels.” said study senior researcher Katrin Svensson, an assistant professor of pathology at Stanford, in a &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings are, of course, preliminary at this point. It will take plenty more time and research, including early successful clinical trials in humans, before BRP should be seen as the next big thing in obesity treatment. But the team’s discovery is the latest to suggest that semaglutide has truly sparked a sea change in obesity treatment. There are now dozens of experimental drugs in the pipeline that are threatening to rival or even surpass Ozempic/Wegovy, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-super-ozempic-higher-dose-semaglutide-leads-to-even-greater-weight-loss-in-major-trial-2000551828"&gt;different formulations&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide. For their part, Svensson and her colleagues have already filed patents on BRP, and she has co-founded a company that she hopes will develop the molecule for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No drug comes without side effects, but the future of obesity treatment could someday involve a lot less nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dessert for people concerned with their blood sugar should be balanced with protein, fiber and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Greek yogurt bark is a great choice for better blood sugar, since the Greek yogurt is a good source of protein and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way to support a healthy blood sugar is eating balanced meals throughout the day, so try to incorporate treats like yogurt bark into a balanced day of healthy eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our No. 1 dietitian-approved dessert for better blood sugar is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259080/strawberry-chocolate-greek-yogurt-bark/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strawberry-Chocolate Greek Yogurt Bark&lt;/a&gt;. “Whole-milk plain Greek yogurt is a great source of protein and fat paired with fiber-rich strawberries that are a source of natural sugar,” says Brown. Berries like strawberries can improve blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal for people with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can even add nuts to this recipe for added crunch and fiber. Recent research shows that a high-fiber diet may help improve blood sugar control, blood lipids and inflammation—all important health markers for anyone living with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, combining a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7957893/high-protein-diabetes-friendly-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy protein source&lt;/a&gt; (like Greek yogurt) with a carbohydrate-rich food leads to a slower, steadier rise and fall of blood glucose compared to eating carbs alone, which can cause a rapid spike followed by a drastic drop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that 2-to-1 or 1-to-1 ratio of carbs to protein that Brown recommended? This dessert fits the bill, with 4 grams carbs, 2 grams protein and 1 gram fat per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is the perfect final touch to this tasty dessert. “Cocoa found in dark chocolate is a functional food that is high in polyphenols and is associated with reduced insulin resistance,” says Brown. Overall, the ingredients in this bark make for a balanced blend of carbs, protein and fat to support blood sugar control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-blood-sugar-friendly-dessert"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Blood-Sugar-Friendly Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many desserts are high in simple carbohydrates, added sugars and saturated fat. These may be fine to eat from time to time for someone without diabetes. However, if you’re living with diabetes, you may benefit from being more intentional with your dessert consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research shows that combining protein with carbohydrate helps improve blood sugar response,” says &lt;a href="https://victorem.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jena Brown, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports dietitian and owner of Victorem Performance Nutrition in Brenham, Texas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Look for a 1-to-1 or 2-to-1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein with some added fat when reading food labels or Nutrition Facts,” recommends Brown. Fiber can also be beneficial. “Fiber is a key component in managing blood sugar because it helps maintain and stabilize glucose levels,” says Smolen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8061127/low-calorie-diabetes-friendly-desserts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood-sugar-friendly dessert&lt;/a&gt; has a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, fiber and fat. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes from a high-carb, low-fiber and low-protein dessert like cake or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chocolate-strawberry-nice-cream-11683637" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Preventing constant blood sugar spikes is important because having persistently high blood sugars may lead to a number of health complications, including eye disease, nerve damage, gum disease, heart disease, kidney disease and skin infections.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-balancing-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Balancing Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the simplest yet most effective nutrition tips for balancing blood sugar is eating regular meals. Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561431/scary-things-that-could-happen-to-your-body-when-you-skip-meals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping meals&lt;/a&gt; may be tempting if you’re short on time or trying to lose weight, it can ultimately lead to a blood sugar (and energy level) roller coaster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Waiting too long between meals can cause big dips in glucose levels,” says Smolen. “These big dips can lead to energy crashes, which is why it’s important to eat balanced meals and snacks throughout the day.” Plus, some research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/skipping-breakfast-dementia-risk-study-8757557" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is linked with prediabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Both Smolen and Brown recommend eating every three to five hours to avoid major shifts in blood glucose and energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing which carbs to eat, Brown also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;looking for whole grains &lt;/a&gt;and fiber-rich foods with at least 3 grams of blood-sugar-balancing fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy blood sugar isn’t just about what you eat. Other lifestyle factors, such as getting regular physical activity and sufficient sleep, can also help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Have no fear! Eating and enjoying dessert is still possible with diabetes. For a diabetes-friendly dessert, include fiber, protein and fat to prevent blood sugar spikes that may occur after a carb-rich dish. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259080/strawberry-chocolate-greek-yogurt-bark/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strawberry-Chocolate Greek Yogurt Bark&lt;/a&gt; offers a tasty blend of protein-filled yogurt, fiber-packed fruit and polyphenol-rich dark chocolate to satisfy your taste buds and your health.

The thought of performing in front of other people, especially in a way that was meant to be silly, sent my anxiety into the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZFFVZRRJBDQZKNIQDREGJLXJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I had signed up for improv to boost my levels of the personality trait of extroversion for a book I was writing about personality change. There was only one problem: My high levels of “neuroticism,” the trait associated with anxiety, immobilized me every time I started to improvise. I felt like everyone could hear my heart pounding; I obsessed over trying to calm down instead of moving the scene forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZJS6X7KSNDBFA446ETWRNOYG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For a while, I coped with improv class by trying to will my anxiety away. I got mad at myself for being so nervous during something that was supposed to be fun, and I tried to wave off the butterflies filling my stomach. But it turns out that was the wrong approach. Some psychologists now think a certain amount of anxiety can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AAH4HFIJMJARHMXVDZRR7KEKVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A concept called the &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/yerkes-dodson-law" target="_blank"&gt;Yerkes-Dodson&lt;/a&gt; curve shows that when people have very high levels of anxiety, they don’t tend to perform well. They might be so worried about a big work project that they avoid getting started, for example. But at very low levels of anxiety, performance also suffers: They might be so relaxed that they rush through the project to watch Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECMW4DD2WNDOJAJ3AGL7ROLPMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s actually the sweet spot in the middle, where anxiety is really adaptive,” or helpful, says Shannon Sauer-Zavala, a clinical psychology professor at the University of Kentucky. At that middle-ground point, anxiety “tells you, ‘This is important, I should pay attention to it, I should prepare for it.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQ5HMOKLMNFIFOXKD7UJQH6TMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Psychologist Tracy Dennis-Tiwary writes in her book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Tense-Anxiety-Though-Feels/dp/0063062100" target="_blank"&gt;Future Tense&lt;/a&gt; that anxiety can help narrow attention and heighten focus and detail orientation. It spurs creativity and motivates us to problem-solve. In some studies, people who felt anxious came up with more and better solutions to problems than those who felt calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AZUE45R5TFENJLN5KP5YJUJOXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dennis-Tiwary writes in her book that when her son was diagnosed with a heart condition as a baby, anxiety and worry fueled her efforts to get him help. “Worry pushed me to figure out how to maximize the chances of a successful surgery,” she writes. Her mind racing, she read academic articles about her son’s condition, made lists of questions for his doctors and scoured community forums for information. “In the end,” she writes, “it was the worry that helped us get through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KU7TODFIZVA3FK6AMIZO6NWA3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anxiety can be a form of caring, of our minds highlighting what matters. It tells us that accomplishing our goals will require effort, and it pushes us to think about what efforts, exactly, we should take. It motivates us to take action. In one study, people who were somewhat, but not overly, anxious were more likely to pursue follow-up care after a heart transplant — and to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYPNQLNHHJHNDBVDAHTZVLG6TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In other words, you shouldn’t want to live completely free of anxiety, because you need anxiety to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DKUY7VDEUJCNJHOLTGEMMZQJUM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DKUY7VDEUJCNJHOLTGEMMZQJUM"&gt;Helpful or unhelpful?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S3EMFU4DRFDHVFHQIP32GMACMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The line between helpful and unhelpful anxiety is whether it causes what scientists call “functional impairment,” meaning it prevents you from living your life: Doing your job, caring for your family or interacting with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QEIGNEA5D5C6BJMDUNIEA4TTXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel your worrying is spiraling out of control, Dennis-Tiwary said when I called her, you should make a list of all the things that can go wrong. But also think about all the things that can go right. “Anxiety evolved to help us navigate uncertainty in life,” Dennis-Tiwary told me. “It evolved to help us focus on potential danger in our future. But to also remember that positive outcomes are still possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JCICVNJNNFEJHJBSSRI34NI2OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For me, this was a new way of thinking about anxiety, and by extension, about neuroticism. Which meant if I wanted to deflate my neuroticism the best way to do that would be to listen to my anxiety, rather than to treat it like a pointless affliction and struggle against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7M37PRKHWZBNPFIS7PNIJJOZPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anxiety can be almost like a gut instinct, providing information from our subconscious about something bad looming ahead. It can be irrational, but it can also be rational. The trick is to learn from it, then let it move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZNPJWQEFS5A6JM6SSUJVBXT6SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s not just the feeling of anxiety that can be helpful in life. Actually &lt;i&gt;experiencing&lt;/i&gt; a moderate number of stressful situations might be beneficial, as well. Just as you shouldn’t shy away from sometimes feeling anxious, you shouldn’t shy away from situations that might provoke anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XMNPE7F5M5CP7B22WFNJSHAQUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Having a child, getting a new job, winning a sports game or performing in front of people — those are all stressful,” says Jeremy Jamieson, a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester who researches stress. “If we didn’t engage with stress, if we just tried to avoid it, we really wouldn’t do anything that was innovative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPM6OFR7TVB7HCLSEQ3FXQCMZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research on both &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://escholarship.org/content/qt4b6787gk/qt4b6787gk.pdf__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CBB932IJ9kMjV2Vf7RlLSO7FH8WSXxyFDLNlFOp1MIcDZvu1rVOSTN007IgpUTl4stVjKwr2CeeL4fvoOKcIRBH7$" target="_blank"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16473950/__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CBB932IJ9kMjV2Vf7RlLSO7FH8WSXxyFDLNlFOp1MIcDZvu1rVOSTN007IgpUTl4stVjKwr2CeeL4fvoOAyJWclW$" target="_blank"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; has found that enduring a small number of adverse events, such as a loved one’s illness or a parent’s divorce, can result in better mental health than experiencing either lots of adversity — or no adversity at all. Even severe misfortunes, such as bereavement, have an eventual silver lining by contributing to resilience. (Though this number is very approximate, Mark Seery, a psychologist at the University of Buffalo, said his research suggests that five adverse events across a lifetime seems like the happy medium.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MQSOTDMCZRBTRAK4AN5FZAXQ6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experience with hardship seems to fortify you for the challenges that inevitably come up in life. Seery compares this “toughening” phenomenon to physical exercise — if you never work out, you’ll never be sore, but you also won’t grow stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="H5QMQXLQHZEB7DNVBYWFAYTNVI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="H5QMQXLQHZEB7DNVBYWFAYTNVI"&gt;How to cope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QFVGZ37KM5FNBHUN4MFUK4WVGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One way to cope with these stressors is to acknowledge that yes, the situation is stressful, but you can handle the stress, because your jitters are giving you fuel. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett-Peters/publication/261767554_Rethinking_Butterflies_The_Affective_Physiological_and_Performance_Effects_of_Reappraising_Arousal_During_Social_Evaluation/links/5773d65908aead7ba06e586c/Rethinking-Butterflies-The-Affective-Physiological-and-Performance-Effects-of-Reappraising-Arousal-During-Social-Evaluation.pdf__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CBB932IJ9kMjV2Vf7RlLSO7FH8WSXxyFDLNlFOp1MIcDZvu1rVOSTN007IgpUTl4stVjKwr2CeeL4fvoOK_e1oCd$" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED566260.pdf__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CBB932IJ9kMjV2Vf7RlLSO7FH8WSXxyFDLNlFOp1MIcDZvu1rVOSTN007IgpUTl4stVjKwr2CeeL4fvoOGIZOmJb$" target="_blank"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that reframing anxiety as a benefit — i.e., anxiety will help me think of the right answer — can help people feel less incapacitated by their &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://escholarship.org/content/qt9n46p04q/qt9n46p04q_noSplash_350ecfb9ba8515f86d07f5bb36a8f8d5.pdf__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CBB932IJ9kMjV2Vf7RlLSO7FH8WSXxyFDLNlFOp1MIcDZvu1rVOSTN007IgpUTl4stVjKwr2CeeL4fvoOFl6orSc$" target="_blank"&gt;nerves&lt;/a&gt;. When we feel this kind of “good” stress, our heart rate increases and our blood vessels dilate to deliver oxygen to the brain. Our bodies produce anabolic hormones, the kind of hormones that help boost performance. (Meanwhile, “bad” stress occurs when you decide you can’t handle the stressor. In that case, your body floods with hormones like cortisol, which don’t aid performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U6MCJCM62RFXTGJRFX6KZDCIYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Jamieson believes it’s preferable to go into a challenging situation, like a work presentation or first date, feeling a little bit amped than feeling totally calm.

However, a significant portion of the population remains uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around twenty-five percent are unsure about the safety difference, while 12 percent believe raw milk is just as safe as pasteurized milk. Six percent think raw milk is actually safer, according to a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center (&lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APPC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-children-face-greater-health-risks"&gt;Children face greater health risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concerning survey finding reveals that two-thirds of respondents, about 66 percent, do not know that children face higher risks from consuming raw milk. This lack of awareness can lead to serious &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bird-flu-outbreak-has-killed-20-million-chickens-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consuming raw milk and raw milk products can make you sick and pasteurization reduces the risk of milk-borne illness,” said Patrick E. Jamieson, director of &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APPC’s Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking for the pasteurization label before buying or consuming milk or milk products such as cheese is good practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bird-flu-cases-linked-to-raw-milk-and-poultry"&gt;Bird flu cases linked to raw milk and poultry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of March 10, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) confirmed 70 cases of H5 bird flu in 13 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most infections were linked to exposure to infected poultry or dairy herds. One person in Louisiana has died from the virus. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since January 2022, bird &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/long-flu-may-be-more-harmful-to-the-brain-than-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; has affected nearly a thousand dairy herds in 17 states and infected over 166 million poultry and wild birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global data from the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) reports 954 cases of human avian flu infections between 2003 and December 2024, with 464 fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-of-bird-flu-in-raw-milk"&gt;Risks of bird flu in raw milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of U.S. adults are unaware that bird flu has only been detected in raw milk. Only 17 percent correctly recognize this fact, while 68 percent remain uncertain. Some incorrectly believe bird flu has been found in pasteurized milk or both types of milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found that mice can contract bird flu by drinking raw milk, raising concerns about potential human transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the FDA has not confirmed whether H5N1 can spread to humans through raw milk, studies suggest a possible risk. The &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; states that untreated milk containing the virus could infect those who consume it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-perception-of-raw-milk-safety"&gt;Public perception of raw milk safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APPC survey found that 22 percent of Americans believe drinking raw milk increases the risk of contracting bird &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/efforts-to-control-bird-flu-are-not-working-are-humans-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;. Another 22 percent think it has no effect, while 53 percent remain unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; stresses that pasteurization eliminates harmful bacteria and viruses, including H5N1 if present. Yet, misinformation continues to influence public opinion on raw milk safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-misunderstood-health-benefits"&gt;Misunderstood health benefits  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite scientific evidence, raw milk advocates continue to make claims about its supposed health benefits. The APPC survey examined several of these beliefs and found that many Americans remain uncertain about their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six percent believe raw milk is as effective as pasteurized milk in preventing osteoporosis. Ten percent incorrectly believe raw milk is more effective, while 59 percent are unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty percent recognize that raw milk does not cure lactose intolerance. Ten percent incorrectly believe it does, while 50 percent remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine percent correctly identify that raw milk does not reduce asthma symptoms, while 54 percent remain unsure. Seven percent believe it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty percent believe raw milk does not enhance the immune system, but 23 percent think it does. Nearly half of respondents, about 47 percent, are unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA refutes these claims, stating that raw milk does not provide superior health benefits and poses serious risks, especially for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-regulations-and-public-opinion"&gt;Government regulations and public opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1987, the FDA has banned the interstate sale of raw milk. However, 30 states permit some form of legal sale. Public opinion on regulation remains divided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 24 percent of survey respondents support allowing raw &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/raw-milk-could-carry-deadly-flu-viruses-for-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; sales across state lines, while 28 percent oppose it. A significant portion remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-state raw milk sales also generate divided opinions. About 24 percent favor unrestricted sales, while 25 percent support limiting sales to farm owners selling from their own land. Fourteen percent believe raw milk sales should be completely banned in their states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal regulations on raw milk spark debate. About 32 percent believe these rules represent unnecessary government intrusion. Another 34 percent disagree, while 33 percent neither agree nor disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of respondents believe state laws prohibiting raw milk sales violate the constitutional rights of sellers. A slightly larger group, about 34 percent, disagrees. Over 40 percent remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-and-warning-labels"&gt;Testing and warning labels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of Americans, about 56 percent, do not believe that state laws requiring warning labels on raw milk containers violate sellers’ constitutional rights. Fourteen percent think they do, while 30 percent are unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Americans remain unaware of the extent of bird flu testing in raw milk. When asked how many states participate in USDA testing, 74 percent of survey respondents said they were unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of January 8, 2025, the USDA reports that its National Milk Testing Strategy includes 28 states. These states account for nearly 65 percent of the nation’s milk production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pasteurized-milk-is-the-safest-choice"&gt;Pasteurized milk is the safest choice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw milk carries significant health risks, including exposure to harmful bacteria and potential bird flu transmission. Many Americans remain uninformed or misinformed about these dangers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research consistently supports pasteurization as the best method to ensure milk safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health organizations continue to emphasize the importance of choosing pasteurized milk to protect consumers, especially vulnerable populations like children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 12:11:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPUEhmYzdVTzJUd1pzXzVLYl9aaUhQYjQ3cHRUZUZzckQ1cjUzRkxjOG80OHNUbWJGWUdmNmZiVkFJcks0cWtjaGxlOGVRUUJiRllWdkE5MFRUb1J5QnZ1bUIxbi1MSnBmS0ZqRjZlTzRFbHo4X2I1NUVQekZRRk5pMG9xS19SR1hSeFJWdEdEaVhFTmM</guid></item><item><title>Sunday Puzzle: Celebrity jeopardy - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQaU9LVXI1M1JjVmpYMllWaDhCVzJoSl9WREdHOU1RR19TREQ5MW9JZXJSSkI4LWFKVEtIN1VSa3JnbXdmaFpnV1ZLZzV4Wk95clNRSUtNdmdWOGNna2Vsd1ZBbWRnY3BidUdjeTRNa1hjQ0xOOFB0emVodlE5UTNOWkFUSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

Among its many effects, the disease often disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, worsening cognitive decline, particularly at night. These disruptions also cause persistent sleep problems, further complicating patients' daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists viewed these sleep and circadian disturbances as mere symptoms of the disease. But emerging research suggests they might play a more active role in its progression. This shift in perspective is prompting a closer look at how managing circadian rhythms could influence the course of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from the &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California San Diego School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; explores one potential intervention: time-restricted feeding. This approach involves eating only within a specific daily window, aligning food intake with the body’s internal clock. Researchers believe this method could help stabilize disrupted rhythms and, in turn, ease some of Alzheimer’s most challenging symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, and her team found that daily eating habits might be more significant than previously thought. Their findings challenge long-held views about Alzheimer’s, shifting attention to how lifestyle factors could influence the disease’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD.

When this rhythm is thrown off balance, it can disrupt nearly every system in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alzheimer’s patients, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/alzheimers-disease-affects-men-and-women-very-differently-experts-find/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;circadian dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; is especially common. Estimates suggest up to 80% experience significant sleep disturbances, which not only interfere with rest but also accelerate cognitive decline. These disruptions often intensify at night, leaving patients disoriented and more vulnerable to confusion and agitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists once assumed these circadian issues were just another consequence of neurodegeneration. However, mounting evidence suggests the relationship may be more complex. Rather than being a passive byproduct of the disease, circadian dysfunction could actively contribute to its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery has sparked fresh interest in potential treatments that target the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-technology-enables-smartwatches-to-detect-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body’s internal clock&lt;/a&gt;. If stabilizing circadian rhythms can slow cognitive decline, interventions like time-restricted feeding could become valuable tools in Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paula Desplats, the senior author of the study and a professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, has highlighted the significance of these findings. Understanding the role of circadian disruptions in Alzheimer’s could lead to groundbreaking shifts in treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For many years, we assumed that the circadian disruptions seen in people with Alzheimer’s are a result of neurodegeneration,” Desplats said. "But now, evidence suggests that circadian disruption might be a primary driver of Alzheimer's pathology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="time_restricted_feeding_a_potential_solution"&gt;Time-Restricted Feeding: A Potential Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a subset of intermittent fasting. Unlike other fasting methods that may restrict calorie intake, TRF solely limits the window of eating. The recent study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413123002735?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, explored the potential of TRF in mice models mimicking Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;This confocal microscopy image shows amyloid plaques (blue and red) in the brain of a mouse.

The outcomes were promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to their counterparts who had unrestricted access to food, the TRF mice &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-ai-technology-predicts-likelihood-of-developing-alzheimer-s-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;showcased enhanced memory&lt;/a&gt;, reduced nighttime hyperactivity, and exhibited a consistent sleep pattern. Moreover, these mice outperformed the control group in cognitive assessments, emphasizing that TRF might curb the behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper, the researchers discovered molecular-level improvements in the TRF mice. There was differential expression of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-ai-technology-predicts-likelihood-of-developing-alzheimer-s-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;multiple genes related to Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and neuroinflammation. Most notably, TRF reduced the accumulation of amyloid proteins in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capability of a mere adjustment in feeding schedules to modify Alzheimer’s progression at the molecular level is nothing short of revolutionary. The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity – it mandates a lifestyle change instead of drug-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Daniel Whittaker, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Desplats Lab at UC San Diego School of Medicine, led the mouse experiments and data analysis for the study.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some high-calorie foods can be a nutritious addition to a balanced eating pattern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like nuts, eggs, dairy, rice and potatoes are packed with healthy fats, fiber, protein and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding these high-calorie foods into balanced meals can help you feel more satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to nutrition advice, the term "&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8033186/what-are-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-calorie&lt;/a&gt;" can have a bit of a bad reputation. The word alone might make you think of fast food or high-added-sugar treats you "shouldn't" be eating. But here's the thing: just because a food is high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8033186/what-are-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mean it can’t be a nutritious part of a balacned diet. Some are packed with nutrients and can actually benefit your health when enjoyed in the right way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Backed by insights from dietitians, we'll shed light on why these “bad” foods deserve a place in your diet. Spoiler alert: it's not about counting every single calorie, but about instead choosing foods that fuel your body and enrich your well-being. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nuts-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8667336" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; may be tiny, but don’t be fooled, they pack a serious calorie punch. Their high calorie content often comes from their impressive levels of healthy fats—like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats—which are essential for brain function and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beyond the calories, they’re loaded with fiber, protein and a range of vitamins and minerals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almonds are one nut that deserves a spot that offers unique health benefits. “Adding almonds to a heart-healthy diet can help &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22722891/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress for those with type 2 diabetes,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.melissarifkinnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Melissa Rifkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.melissarifkinnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;, M.S., RDN, CDN,&lt;/a&gt; a Connecticut-based registered dietitian. “Their low glycemic index and high content of healthy fats, fiber and magnesium may help improve blood sugar control, making them a great choice for individuals with diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, Rifkin highlighted the link between almond intake and gut health benefits. “Almonds contain fiber, polyphenols and unsaturated fats, all of which play a role in supporting gut health. Research suggests that almonds may positively alter gut microbiota functionality, promoting a healthier digestive system,” Rifkin explained.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though eggs are more calorie-dense than some other foods, those calories pack a powerful nutritional punch, thanks to their yolks. “Eggs are full of essential micronutrients like choline, vitamin B12, vitamin D and selenium,” shared &lt;a href="https://nutritionbymegan.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Huff, RD, LD,&lt;/a&gt; registered dietitian. “They are also a great source of protein and are an easy way to get protein in at breakfast,” she added. Plus, they’re incredibly versatile—you can scramble, fry, boil, bake or even poach them into your meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Contrary to what you may think, eggs cholesterol content doesn’t translate to high blood cholesterol levels. Most current epidemiologic studies indicate no significant association between consuming one egg daily and blood cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk, per a review published in &lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack, these eggs are great for when you need something fast, nourishing and easy. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/avocado-deviled-eggs-8609205" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocado Deviled Eggs&lt;/a&gt; for an egg-forward dish that is equally delish and easy to prepare.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Full-Fat Dairy  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The consumer perception is that whole milk is either mostly or entirely fat,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarah.hester.rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Hester, M.S., RD,&lt;/a&gt; a North Carolina-based registered dietitian. But she clarified that this is not the case. “Most people are surprised to learn that whole milk on store shelves is only 3.25% fat. All dairy milk, no matter the fat percentage, contains the same essential nutrients as well as carbohydrates and protein,” Heister added. Many of the nutrients found in whole milk help keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, full-fat dairy can keep you feeling fuller for longer, thanks to fat adding a satiety factor. Data published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt; highlights that dairy foods, regardless of their fat content, did not negatively impact cardiometabolic health and may instead alleviate certain cardiometabolic risk factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One easy way to include whole milk in your diet is to make a smoothie, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249318/fruit-yogurt-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fruit &amp;amp; Yogurt Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Cheese  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cheese often gets a bad rap for its fat content, but some cheeses can actually be beneficial to your diet,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Dish LLC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is a good source of protein, with each ounce providing about 7 grams. “Protein helps to repair muscles, support cell transport and increase satiety levels,” Kolsea explained. She also highlights the micronutrients cheese provides. “Cheese is also a great source of calcium, with each serving providing 20% of the recommended daily value. Calcium supports muscle contractions, cell signaling and maintaining strong bones,” Kolesa shared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in &lt;em&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; showed that eating cheese was associated with slightly lower risks of heart disease, stroke, some types of breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, bone fractures and dementia. For some other health conditions, they didn’t find any clear link (neither positive nor negative).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might be easy to overdo cheese (remember: one ounce is typically considered a serving), but when enjoyed in moderation, it’s a fantastic way to add nutrition and flavor to your meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-rice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Rice  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This humble grain is a powerhouse that deserves a spot on your plate. It’s versatile, cost-effective and provides a steady energy boost that can help fuel your day. Whether you're opting for classic white rice or nutty brown rice, this pantry staple is a fast and easy way to round out a meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “White rice is a low-FODMAP food, so it works great for individuals with IBS,” shared &lt;a href="http://www.dietitianmoushumi.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Moushumi Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://dietitianmo.wordpress.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;, M.S., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; registered dietitian. It’s rich in carbohydrates which your body prefers as an energy source. She also shared that it provides key nutrients, like magnesium. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in &lt;em&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; showed that there were no significant associations between white rice intake and higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and metabolic syndrome after evaluating available related data.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to mention, rice pairs with almost everything. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279075/chicken-broccoli-curry-with-turmeric-brown-rice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Curry&lt;/a&gt;? Check. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/stir-fry-dinner-recipes-to-make-forever-8416882" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Stir fry&lt;/a&gt;? Definitely. Even a bit of melted butter or splash of soy sauce transforms it into a simple, cozy side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Potatoes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatos have had such a bad reputation, but it’s time to correct the record. Yes, they’re a bit higher in calories, but they’re also jam-packed with essential nutrients like&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044322/are-potatoes-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; potassium, vitamin C and fiber&lt;/a&gt; (especially if you leave the skin on). These nutrients help support heart health, immune health, gut health and more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mashed, roasted or baked, they’re incredibly versatile and work as both a star on the plate or a supporting sidekick. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/creamy-roasted-potato-salad-8416793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Roasted Potato Salad&lt;/a&gt; is a simple dish to enjoy that includes a healthy dose of potato. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s time to move past the outdated fear of high-calorie foods and recognize their place in a balanced, nourishing diet. Foods like nuts, eggs, full-fat dairy, cheese, rice and potatoes show that calories aren't the sole determinant of a food's nutritional value. These so-called "bad" foods offer a wealth of nutritional benefits, from essential vitamins and minerals to healthy fats and high-quality protein. By focusing on the bigger picture of health and not just calorie counts, you can better appreciate how these foods contribute to your overall well-being. It's not about labeling foods as "good" or "bad," but about recognizing the variety of ways they can support your health and fuel your body.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Despite her doctor noticing high protein levels in her urine during an annual check-up, she didn’t think much of it—until she suddenly had to be rushed to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I literally woke up one day and I was peeing straight blood,” Eve recalled, explaining that she was given morphine at the hospital and later passed a kidney stone. She attributed her symptoms to excessive protein intake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Experts warn against high-protein diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, consuming too much protein can be harmful, particularly for individuals with kidney disease, as it affects how the body filters out protein waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, high-protein diets often lack sufficient fiber, which can lead to issues such as constipation, headaches, and bad breath. Diets high in saturated fat from red meat may also increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eve, who previously admitted to being “addicted to protein”, criticized the restrictive diet, stating, “The carnivore diet is so stupid.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Carnivore diet’s growing controversy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carnivore diet has gained popularity on social media, with many influencers promoting its benefits. The diet mainly consists of beef, poultry, fish, pork, and other animal products, and has even been endorsed by podcaster Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier, another content creator took to Instagram to share, “carnivore diet destroyed my kidneys!!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, health experts have warned of its potential dangers, including the risk of kidney stones, which are hard deposits that can be extremely painful to pass. Some researchers have also described the diet as inflammatory and pro-aging, cautioning that following such extreme food restrictions is like “playing with fire.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some social media users dismissed Eve Catherine’s health scare, others appreciated her for raising awareness about the risks associated with extreme dieting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Urging her followers to be cautious, she advised, “Don’t eat too much protein, OK? Don’t neglect your fiber intake.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/jpmorgan-staff-vents-about-rto-in-private-chats-after-bank-disables-employee-comments-101742111177446.html"&gt;Also read: JPMorgan staff vents about RTO in private chats after bank disables employee comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:01:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>I was diagnosed with a brain tumour after getting blurry vision while I was pregnant - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQel9uMTAzNy1wMVZ2U2lDenlINWZzWG5FSjZJSC1vdGZfeldvdkc1dU80QmV0VFc3WW0wS3V5VDl6Z2dTSUF4dGlaMjlDeUF0alRXTWgwdm1HZ2dhRU9CZ0JlWHI3elliN1gyQXM4cEc1b3NIYnJJY25sQ3RrczZ4cXdGcjlXSTJPcE4tR1ZoZ1JhdWdwaEFR0gGcAUFVX3lxTFBjcTdhNVl0Z1YzVVg3S3g5S3hkNHh2MnZfY1RRaVNwYXl0V2cxeVd0OGg2ZEhvNXFwZ2JRVTI1clJLY0JJQ1NDZGUxSWtjaFppVWxtQXB6QnktNHpMSGZZbVhKelJjZHJ5MVVDQjk2aVpyczFnOWlRc0tqQTdoR04wcW0xSXpJLWtYMTdPdDRjV0ZJZF9obU1JamxHdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman was diagnosed with a brain tumour after getting blurry vision while she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abbie Keet developed the golf ball-sized tumour and started having eye problems when she was pregnant with her first child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 24-year-old said that after the birth of her son Hudson in August 2023, it got worse - and she would go blind for 30 seconds every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She booked an appointment with her local opticians, who suspected she had papilledema - swelling of the optic disc - but hospital tests revealed she had a large mass on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Keet later had a biopsy, which confirmed she had craniopharyngioma - a rare, non-cancerous brain tumour which usually grows near the pituitary gland - and was booked for an operation to remove the tumour in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons were able to remove most of the tumour, but due to its location, they were unable to remove it all and Mrs Keet has to go for tests every six months to check for any growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her symptoms starting whilst she was pregnant, doctors told her they didn't relate to her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Keet, a stay at home mother from Bognor Regis, Sussex, said: 'I didn't really have a good pregnancy from the start, but in my second trimester, my sickness was awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Abbie Keet developed the golf ball-sized tumour and started having eye problems when she was pregnant with her first child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is Abbie Keet's brain scan showing the tumour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 24-year-old said that after the birth of her son Hudson in August 2023, it got worse - and she would go blind for 30 seconds every five minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In my third trimester, my eyes started to go funny - my vision was going blurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I gave birth to my son, and my eyes got worse. I was going blind for 30 seconds at a time every five minutes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Keet was transferred to the eye clinic at Chichester Hospital, where she had further tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'The hospital called me within a few hours, they did more tests on me, and sent me to the emergency floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had some blood tests and a CT scan. The doctor came back into the room and told me I had a large mass on the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From there, she was transferred to a neurosurgeon at Southampton Hospital, where doctors said she had a craniopharyngioma - but needed a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2024, Mrs Keet went into hospital for a biopsy, which confirmed her initial diagnosis given to her by her neurosurgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I first got referred to Southampton, I was going blind every couple of minutes, and I was blind for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When the biopsy confirmed that I had a tumour, it was a sigh of relief that I knew what tumour it was and that it was benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we got the news, it was a sigh of relief that it wasn't cancerous, but I had a whole new worry about the surgery that I was preparing for.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February 2024, she went for surgery to remove the tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgery lasted eight hours, and doctors were not able to remove all the tumour due to its location on her pituitary gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother said: 'My tumour was pushing on my optical nerve, which was linked to my pituitary gland, so they had to leave the tiniest amount, but they got the most out that they could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was in there for eight hours, my pituitary gland died in the process, so I am on hormone replacement, and I could go through early menopause because of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her operation, Mrs Keet said she struggled with recovery; her wound kept weeping, and in November 2024, she underwent more surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is Abbie Keet's biopsy scar after her operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Surgeons were able to remove most of the tumour, but due to its location, they were unable to remove it all and Mrs Keet has to go for tests every six months to check for any growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will also have to go for scans every six months to make sure the tumour doesn't grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to return to the hospital multiple times to have a wound cleaned out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I then underwent more surgery to have my bone flap removed due to the infection. In November 2024, I then had my last surgery, which was having my metal plate fitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have to go for a regular scan due to them not being able to remove all of the tumour because of the area the tumour was in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Keet said her diagnosis meant she missed out on most of Hudson's early years' development, and she is keen to make up for lost time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This had a massive effect on us as a family,' the mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I missed my son's first year of growing up due to spending a lot of that time in and out of hospitals. My partner was left to care for me while taking care of our son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My mother-in-law had to move in with us because I couldn't even be alone with him, as I could go blind at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am making up for lost time now and spending as much time as I can with him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Catherine Fraher, Director of Services and Digital Health at The Brain Tumour Charity, said: 'Thank you to Abbie for bravely sharing her story to raise awareness of brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know that every family deals with a brain tumour diagnosis and its aftermath in their own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why The Brain Tumour Charity offers support to anyone who needs it.

People who have minimal or no cardiovascular risk can prevent disease, while those who deal with things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or obesity can use walking to reach their health goals and prevent future strokes or heart attacks, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, walking is so good for so many different things, the Harvard Health report stated that “the next time you have a medical check-up, don’t be surprised if your doctor hands you a prescription to walk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Sawitree Pamee / EyeEm via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Sawitree Pamee / EyeEm via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Approximately 21 minutes may be the magic number, but short walking bursts each day are beneficial, too.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking keeps you from prolonged sitting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working from your living room, your kitchen or your office may have its perks (no commuting!) but there are also some disadvantages. Many of us are sitting more than ever because of the current work-from-home lifestyle, and sitting all day can affect our bodies over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not so much that chairs are evil and sitting is really bad for you,” Harvard evolutionary biology professor Dan Lieberman &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sitting-all-day-bad-for-health_l_6022a938c5b6d78d444a1819" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="previously told HuffPost" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d34253e4b0756a721abf18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6022a938c5b6d78d444a1819" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;previously told HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s that sitting too much is bad for you if you don’t also exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh noted that walking in any capacity keeps you from prolonged sitting, which can only be a health benefit in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you need motivation, try walking with a friend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh said that going for a walk with friends is a great way to create accountability for both you and your walking buddies. Think about it: You’re more likely to lace up your sneakers if your friend is heading over to meet you for a walk you agreed to earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll each hold each other accountable to developing a walking habit and sticking to it,” Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don’t have to task your friend group with high-stress, quick-paced walks. As long as you get out there, you’re benefiting your body. Plus, if you’re someone who likes to walk and talk, you’ll get some enjoyable conversation and laughter out of a walk with a friend, Singh noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also listen to music or a podcast on your walk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are more of a solo exerciser, Singh suggested that you save a good podcast, audiobook or soundtrack for your walks to make them more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try telling yourself that you can only listen to these things during your walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’ll get you excited to go on a walk, and [you’ll] get the ‘reward’ of listening to your favorite thing,” Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SolStock via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SolStock via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Turn on your favorite podcast to make your walk more interesting.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can’t fit in the full 21 minutes a day, that’s OK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between work, errands, family obligations and household chores, life is busy. Taking time for yourself may not be feasible right now and that’s OK. If you can’t fit in the recommended 21 minutes of walking a day, start small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a quick one-minute jaunt pays off,” according to the report by Harvard Health. The report noted that a 2014 study from the University of Utah found that “for every minute of brisk walking that women did throughout the day, they lowered their risk of obesity by 5%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So start small. Task yourself with a minute-long walk down your driveway this afternoon, or take that 10-minute work check-in call as you walk around your block. No amount of time is too short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

In her own words, she "busted her knee training for a marathon" which put plans to complete a triathlon on ice indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something I've had to come to terms with, too. Anterior cruciate ligament ruptures to both of my knees caused by playing soccer in my mid-20s and early-30s have rendered my lower body highly susceptible to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything is connected," Mounsey-Jennings tells me. An initial runner's knee diagnosis led to issues affecting the patellar tendon, knee pad inflammation, the knee pad tracking incorrectly, and years spent on physiotherapist and osteopath treatment tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I essentially experienced knee pain anytime I ran so had to stop running altogether, which was incredibly sad," says Mounsey-Jennings. "Physio and osteopathy helped but never sorted it. I also discovered I had a pelvis torsion/imbalance, though I'm not sure which came first, so a lot of my knee issues were connected with my pelvis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a final bid to resurrect ambitions to one day finish a triathlon, Mounsey-Jennings turned to reformer Pilates. "After each class I felt taller, more stable, and most importantly my knee felt better," she says. It prompted her to train as a Pilates teacher, which led to her launching two studios in London under her brand &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.avalonpilates.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.avalonpilates.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Avalon Pilates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more I learned about my body, the more I learned about the exercises that help with hip and knee strength and mobility. I focused on these over the years, and before you know it I've signed up to a triathlon and managed to do it with no pain," says Mounsey-Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-pilates-can-protect-and-strengthen-weak-knees"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How Pilates can protect and strengthen weak knees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounsey-Jennings's experience should offer a roadmap to recovery for anyone struggling with weak and injury-prone knees. "Quite often runners are quad dominant and our glutes don't fire up as much as they should," says Mounsey-Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4ZDTmXXrPYCBYMUpWoZgLF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4ZDTmXXrPYCBYMUpWoZgLF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knee issues, she says, can also be triggered by "kinetic chain injuries" caused by imbalances or dysfunction affecting muscles or joints further up or down the body—such as weaknesses in the feet, ankles or hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pilates really helps address body imbalances and strengthens all those stabilizer muscles around the knee joint," says Mounsey-Jennings. "Any lunge, scooter or side-lying glute work is amazing for building back knee strength and moves performed with feet in straps does a great job at mobilizing and strengthening the hips."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, she adds, a strong core is essential for runners, "so you're in the right place with Pilates".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-pilates-exercises-to-strengthen-weak-knees"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Best Pilates exercises to strengthen weak knees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running her own reformer Pilates studio means Mounsey-Jennings is in the privileged position of being able to practice reformer Pilates most days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I focus a lot on ankle mobility and strength with calf raises, footwork [essentially squats performed lying on your back] drills, side-lying glute work, single-leg bridges and step-ups, scooters and hamstring extensions," says Mounsey-Jennings. "It keeps my body injury-free and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are several Pilates-inspired exercises you can do at home, in the gym or in a mat-based Pilates class that Mounsey-Jennings also recommends to strengthen weak and injury-prone knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six of the best she swears by that—with patience, perseverence and (of course) a clean bill of health from a registered doctor or physio from the outset—should get you up and running again pain-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-single-leg-calf-raise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

You should feel this working your hamstrings in the backs of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend as far as you can manage, then slowly step your feet back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 30-60 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A study has found that extreme weight fluctuations in obese people with cardiovascular disease significantly increases the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) research analysed data from 8,297 UK participants recruited as part of the UK Biobank study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were followed for nearly 14 years, with weight loss as well as weight gain raising risk levels, in a study described as "the first of its kind". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Lead author Dr Jufen Zhang said: "Clinicians should bear this in mind, particularly with regards to new drugs on the market... &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd188m73vn1o" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lauded for delivering fast weight-loss&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This study is the first of its kind to examine the link between weight change and all-cause mortality in obese individuals with cardiovascular disease," said the associate professor at the university's Medical Technology Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Maintaining a stable weight, even within the obese range, appears to be crucial for reducing mortality risk in patients with cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The university, which has its &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/medical-technology-research-centre/our-facilities" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;main campuses in Cambridge and Chelmsford&lt;/a&gt;, said the participants were all obese and had histories of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The research revealed those who gained more than 10kg (22lb) across the study period had a three-fold increase in the risk of cardiovascular death and nearly double the risk of all-cause mortality compared to those who maintained a stable weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also found weight loss of more than 10kg (22lb) was associated with a 54% higher risk of all-cause mortality, which the authors suggested meant both extremes of weight change could be detrimental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Zhang, who carried out the study with colleagues Prof Barbara Pierscionek and Dr Rudolph Schutte, said: "It was perhaps unsurprising that significant weight gain was associated with higher mortality, but interesting that a similar association was found among those who lost a lot of weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A higher body mass index (BMI), smoking, and previous alcohol consumption were linked to an increased likelihood of significant weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also found an association between significant weight gain and younger age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2022-part-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Health Survey for England&lt;/a&gt;, the number of people living with obesity in the country rose from 15% in 1993 to 29% in 2022 and more than two-thirds of people aged over 35 were considered overweight or obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is estimated to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2023/06/07/government-plans-to-tackle-obesity-in-england/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cost the NHS

&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460103/video-Kardashian-family-plastic-surgery.html"&gt;25 procedures&lt;/a&gt; (she's lost count of the exact number) over nearly three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while Ms Silverman is now regularly complimented for her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14448157/plastic-surgeon-daddy-transformations-surgery-craze.html"&gt;age-defying looks&lt;/a&gt;, it was a long process of trial and error to get the look she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After doing some minor tweaks in her 20s and 30s - including facials, peels, lasers, &lt;span&gt;Botox, filler, breast augmentation, &lt;/span&gt;rhinoplasty &lt;span&gt;and a vaginal reconstruction - she thought she had been through it all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then she started feeling especially bad her appearance in her 40s, and when she looked in the mirror, she said it was like 'staring at an old crone, a total Disney witch'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Silverman is now sharing her insights with Daily Mail readers in the hope that she can prevent people from making the same mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in four Americans will undergo some kind of cosmetic work in their lifetime, but some surveys suggest up to six in 10 regret it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra Lena Silverman, who is based in Miami, told DailyMail.com that it was a process of trial and error to look the way she does now at the age of 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The surgery she was most pleased with was her mini facelift, which was done at the same time as a forehead lift, at the age of 47. Above left, before the procedure and right, afterwards &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vaginal reconstruction left me incontinent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE: Up to $20,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of all of the cosmetic procedures she has tried, Ms Silverman says the vaginal reconstruction she had in her early 40s was the most painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why she opted for the procedure, she says: 'I would argue that my full vaginal reconstruction wasn't cosmetic because my uterus was falling low after the birth of my son, so I actually needed it, but it was the most painful thing I've ever gone through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The major issues I faced were incontinence and the fact that I was so loose down there that I couldn't feel anything during sex. It was bad. And not great for my marriage.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the procedure she also had labiaplasty to reduce the size of her labia minora - the skin folds surrounding the urethra and vagina. The entire operation took around six hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although the surgery went well and the results were 'spectacular', Ms Silverman reveals that the recovery was very tough. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'I had a catheter for two weeks after the surgery and was prescribed Percocet with Tylenol for the pain, which had the side effect of making me terribly constipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Words cannot fully describe the pain. Since I had a catheter, I couldn't go to the bathroom, so I had to take [the laxative] MiraLAX. Then I would have explosions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I ended up needing to wear a freakin' diaper! Not to mention during that two week period, I had to go to the emergency room three times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Touching on her own experience with breast implants, Ms Silverman says: 'For my first breast augmentation on my late 20s, the profile was too high and the medium was too large, so I actually ended up looking top-heavy. I eventually got saline implants replaced with silicone and did a breast lift and went smaller and lower'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My husband was in Las Vegas for much of this, so I was handling it all solo for the most part. Eventually, the doctor changed my pain medication, and that helped a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once the catheter was out, I was on the mend, but everything down there hurt for a good month.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While things are '&lt;span&gt;still looking and &lt;/span&gt;feeling great down there' 15 years on, Ms Silverman says for others contemplating the surgery 'if you don't need it, don't do it'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't get filler in your 20s and 30s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE:&lt;/span&gt; From $500 to $1,500 per syringe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fillers - gel-like substances injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, smooth lines and enhance facial contours - have become big business because the results are instant with little-to-no down time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of women using fillers has increased close to threefold in the US over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, 1.8 million filler procedures were performed, increasing to 5.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular dermal filler brands are Juvederm, Restylane and Sculptra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because they are made using hyaluronic acid, which is a natural component of the skin, and experts say these brands offer a more natural look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular areas for dermal fillers include the lips, cheeks, and under-eye areas, and volumes range from 0.25ml for a 'bee sting' look in the lips to up to 3ml per cheek for chiseled cheekbones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their popularity, Ms Silverman warns against getting fillers too early, as she believes they can age the skin prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because they can stretch the top layer of skin and users will need to keep replacing this lost volume with yet more filler, leading to a 'puffy' or 'hamster cheek' look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Anything that removes fat or stretches out skin is not good for when you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try to stay away from filler in your face when you're in your 20s and 30s.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had one horror story with filler in her lips, where the injector made her look 'like a duck,' so she flags the importance of finding a reputable clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once damage is done, she says it can take a long time and lots of money to reverse the effects of filler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back, Ms Silverman says she would have avoided getting filler so early as this led to her needing a facelift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now she is older, she is a big fan of the injectables and &lt;span&gt;she has '&lt;/span&gt;gotten them almost everywhere at this point' including in the lips, smile lines, chin, jaw, temples, nose, cheeks, knees, vagina, butt, hands, earlobes, and corners of the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Never do buccal fat removal &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE: Anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chrissy Teigen (pictured in May, 2021 on the right) admitted to receiving buccal fat removal in September 2021. Teigen's (pictured in late 2021 on the right) face has a more angular appearance after receiving the procedure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Buccal fat removal has become a hot procedure over recent years to achieve a more chiseled look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure involves removing fat pads from inside the cheeks, giving them a more angular face as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most notable A-listers who have had or are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14044839/plastic-surgeon-celebrities-buccal-fat-removal-surgery.html"&gt;rumored to have had&lt;/a&gt; their buccal fat pads removed is model Chrissy Teigen, who kickstarted a major trend among celebrities and non-celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She admitted that she had had her buccal fat removed and also talked about her eyebrow hair transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other well-known stars including Lea Michele, Bella Hadid, and Anya Taylor-Joy are also believed to have had the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why she advises against the fashionable tweakment, Ms Silverman says: 'You actually need your buccal fat because as you age, you lose volume in your face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With no padding in the cheeks, the beauty expert says people can look too sucked in and gaunt as they get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warns that then filler is then needed to add volume, and this can change the shape of your face further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So make sure that's what you're willing to do,' she concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't do the 'Y' Lift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE: Between $2,000 and $7,000 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Y Lift, better known as a 'liquid facelift', is a 'facial contouring' technique that uses strategically placed fillers to rejuvenate the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It aim is to restore a youthful 'Y' shape from the cheekbones to the chin, and improve the appearance of wrinkles and sagging skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be &lt;span&gt;completed in as little as 30&lt;/span&gt; minutes and the results are immediate, whereas facelifts can take a few weeks to see any results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Silverman says getting a Y Lift is something she will 'always regret'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reveals: 'The first time I did it was great - I got filler in the perimeter of my jowls, which was lifting and made me look more sculpted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the second time I did it, I got pie-faced, and by that I mean there was so much filler in my cheeks that I looked completely round, like a pie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It caused my skin to stretch and then sag, and it took about two years to fully fix it because the filler goes deep inside the muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By the time I got my facelift two years later, I still had filler in there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Silverman said her face looked too rounded after too much filler and she warns it can change the shape of your face for the worse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Do LOTS of research before rhinoplasty and breast augmentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Price for rhinoplasty and breast augmentation: Each treatment f&lt;/span&gt;rom $5,000 to $10,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Silverman says that she wishes she had done more research before getting her first nose job but it was before the age of the internet and it was more difficult to find feedback on practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, she ended up with a mediocre doctor who took out too much cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalls: '&lt;span&gt;I got my first rhinoplasty in my twenties and &lt;/span&gt;it was honestly underwhelming. I went to a doctor in Baltimore and received his signature style: these itty-bitty noses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During our consultation, I described what I wanted, that is a normal size nose, not a teeny tiny one. I trusted he would listen and not take his typical approach with me. I was wrong - UGH! I left his office with a nose that was just... too small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't like it. While it was better than what I had started out with, it wasn't what I wanted, and I kicked myself for not going to someone else. The shape of my nose bothered me for years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her first nose job, Ms Silverman has had two more and she is finally happy with the way it looks, describing it as 'fine'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The beauty expert says the same amount of research needs to be done ahead of getting breast implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help pick a doctor, she recommends looking at as many before/after photos as possible to get an idea of the results they can offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on her own experience with breast implants she adds: 'For my first breast augmentation on my late 20s, the profile was too high and the medium was too large, so I actually ended up looking top-heavy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I eventually got saline implants replaced with silicone and did a breast lift and went smaller and lower. Be cautious about going too big or too high.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With both nose jobs and breast augmentation procedures, Ms Silverman says it is a 'must' to choose &lt;span&gt;a board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in that specific procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She adds: '&lt;/span&gt;DO NOT TAKE ANY SHORTCUTS TO SAVE MONEY! Do your research, as always, and be sure to tell your surgeon exactly what you’re looking for during your consultation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Watch out for facial peels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE: Anywhere from $125 to $2,500 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to facial peels, Ms Silverman says she has 'tried them all'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments are designed to exfoliate the skin and promote new cell growth to improve skin texture and address various skin issues such as acne and pigmentation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Silverman's favorites are the retinol and chemical peels that her facialist Mindy Kim offers at her office in the Miami area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she now has her favorites, she says she has '&lt;span&gt;been down some major rabbit holes &lt;/span&gt;with specialists who looked good on the surface but would do things to my face and body that made me look worse, just so I'd come back and spend more with them'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Again, she says the most important thing is to do thorough research and to pay attention to online reviews.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also warns that some of the harsher peels require anesthesia and can be 'pretty strong so you look like a burn victim afterward'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the more intense peels, she warns that recovery can take at least a week so you will need to plan accordingly and 'you can't get too many of them because your skin can get very, very thin'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't get liposuction... on the knees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;PRICE: From $3,000 to $6,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;LEFT: The bad lipo Ms Silverman did in her knees with sagging afterwards RIGHT: After she had a threading treatment to rectify the issue. The specialized, dissolvable threads work by lifting and tightening the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first time Ms Silverman tried liposuction on her body was in her 30s, right after she had her son, and she said the experience was 'great'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when she went for her second round of lipo in her 40s it proved to be a disaster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While getting her stomach done, the doctor said she could get her knees sculpted and Ms Silverman agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she said it was a decision she went on to regret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'The lipo doctor also told me that she could liposuction my knees. In the moment, it seemed like a good idea (this was before I'd realized the terrible results on my stomach). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Oh, if only I could go back in time! She ended up taking out too much fat from my knees, which made them very uneven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, with so much fat gone, the skin on my knees started to sag majorly; I had to get threads (specialized, dissolvable threads to lift and tighten the skin) in them. This is when I also started to get filler in my knees too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to go back for tweaks about every five months. All in all, my liposuction experience was terrible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of her traumatic lipo experience, Ms Silverman says she would never recommend the treatment on the knees because the fat there is necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes: '&lt;span&gt;I actually caused more damage by removing the fat when I could have just eaten more protein and done more lunges at the gym. Don't touch your knees.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;And... the surgery she was most pleased with?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Silverman says of all the procedures she's had, she was most pleased with her mini facelift, which was done at the same time as a forehead lift, at the age of 47. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She got the facelift to help lift sagging skin, something she had unsuccessfully tried to do with fillers in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The facelift that I'd had done turned out to be great as all the inflammation in my cheeks and under my eyes started to go away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The facelift that I'd had done turned out to be great as all the inflammation in my cheeks and under my eyes started to go away,' shes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The facelift that I'd had done turned out to be great as all the inflammation in my cheeks and under my eyes started to go away,' she&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was starting to look sculpted, and even more lifted than I'd been in my thirties.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going forward, Ms Silverman says she plans to maintain herself through 'diet, nutrition, working out, and small treatments'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;Ms Silverman's book, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Botox-Rebels-Self-Love-Eternal/dp/B0DK62B4ZT"&gt;From Bullshit to Botox: A Rebel's Guide To Self Love And Eternal Yout&lt;/a&gt;h, is out now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:08:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNclJZU3FDNFdXcVVwUWFaZThPVlFscW1OeGI3d1J5Sm1sckExTHRzYTRBY29neGJQOHJjNXFXd3hMR1hZZENReEhKRkFyTnJpWktvRWJWSXVEUzBsQXpOZ3U1NlJJRmQ5bk51bmtyd1VUS080VVUxSjZuVFMyaDBXQUloel90THAwMkRjSnRJS3lRRGo3X0pVTGNXVTB1Vmt4SDB1SmtsSTg</guid></item><item><title>Tragic twist of fate as little girl, 6, with cancer dies from unrelated illness - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOYmpUNjQ2aDU0dmUyTzk3MmhZWXhSTUl4UHNaZEpTR0ZVNnd1OW1mZ1hSMHJrYTFBQTdRbG9HRVRrNEV0ZE1PMnRoTW5MQ2VuR1J2TUx3OGl5Sy16aEc0SnZ4WTRTZ2JublNsdWpoMzFrV203d3JTb0lKdXBBUTI0Sm1CS0FzWko0VWI4Ump1QnRIeFZfektIU1ctUXVtUVdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A cancer-stricken six-year-old girl from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-07659b30-021a-11f0-899a-03e998d49ec3" class="class"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, who had just received her final bout of chemotherapy, tragically died after she came down with another, unrelated sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lola Zimmer, 6, died from a fungal infection on March 4, five months after she was diagnosed with Leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her long battle with illness began on October 31, 2024, when she went trick-or-treating with parents, Alyssa Aguilar and Drew Zimmer, and little sister, Pheobe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortly after leaving their her home in Flagstaff for an evening of when when the young girl 'collapsed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were heading out the door to go trick-or-treating and she collapsed,' her father, Drew Zimmer, told &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2025/03/14/6-year-old-with-cancer-dies-fungal-infection/"&gt;KPHO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worry-riddled parents then took their daughter to a nearby emergency room before she was 'airlifted' to Phoenix Children's Hospital for further treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within 24 hours of arriving at the children's hospital - 150 miles from their home - Lola started on her first round of chemotherapy, a post shared by Lola's grandmother, Salina Aguilar, on &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/facebook/index.html" id="mol-b378c1d0-0220-11f0-899a-03e998d49ec3" class="class"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several months later, on February 24, the Kindergarten student completed her second, and final, round of chemotherapy - 'the consolidation phase,' as her grandmother called it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For all we know, she was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-0a0a3f40-0223-11f0-899a-03e998d49ec3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;

These extra boosts came from doing popular exercise routines but adding the element of water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from universities across Korea and China worked together, looking over nearly 300 participants between the ages of 20 and 70. All of whom were overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These people took part in hour-long classes just two or three times per week, doing routines like Zumba, yoga, aerobics or even jogging, but in water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants lost an average of 2kg, or 4.4lbs, between week four and week 10. Those who continued the regimen for 10 weeks or more lost 3kg, or 6.6 lbs, on average.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women over the age of 45 particularly benefited from this exercise technique, the study found. Participants also saw their average waist size drop by 3cm, or 1.1 inches, but weight loss wasn’t the only benefit from the water-based fitness program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The participants were able to also decrease their heart rate and body fat. All the while keeping the strain and pressure of exercise away from vital joints like the knees and ankles, which tend to be weak or painful in people with obesity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers hope these findings, published in the &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/3/e091743" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;BMJ Open journal&lt;/a&gt;, can prove water-based fitness is an “effective intervention” to reduce body weight and obesity. However they also noted more research is needed in wider population studies to confirm that underwater exercise has better results than those done on land. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14486535/surprising-exercise-weight-loss-water-waist-aerobics.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NHS &lt;/a&gt;estimates around one in four adults and one in five children between 10 and 11 are living with obesity. This is classified as having a BMI of 30-39.9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those with a BMI of 40 or over are considered “severely obese” according to the health service while those between 25 and 29.9 are classified as overweight. However, it also notes that this system is not always accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BMI is a measurement that compares your height and weight. But it doesn’t take into account things like muscle mass, which generally weighs more than fat, or waist circumference, which can indicate a high amount of belly fat - posing health risks even if a person appears skinny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNem44dWxMVmtzMzdRMzNLMy1qRGV0a0xsaUdvek1kZDh0eWh6dVRjc1Fnbkw3UHMzTWRUaXhaSTZZWUtIbXpacUNBT0FCMGo5S0xzQXg4VGxaZHBPNEkyd3YzNHNubVNFc0hwSWZ5YTdSWHVDOGczMDJIU0s3NDNULTQ3MNIBiAFBVV95cUxNeXl3QlNmN3d6NmJ1WDJNc3RLaEN0SHdtSUJFWVpkUEcyT1cwQjBqYzdzZmpPTU1PY1o3cjRfVUp6Z3puWmFWTXZaZF85ZW1LYWNITldGaV9sMHB2a3drTTNld3NtU1duWUwyQVF0LUR4WTFCZ2kxUWlYMG45OVhqZTIxZ2pZOWVi</guid></item><item><title>Radiation taints 'fairytale' memories of Coldwater Creek in US - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5oaU5Ud1BNSTl0Y1JRb3ZaUUxtczl6SkNmZzhleGVwWWZXZExIeEJOM1U1MzNhRE4zWV9CSzFDQ3lwWTRsVGlKNW5lVC1oVngxVVdBVnU0WW1KQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5tMFZ6TlhVSGljZDR4eTZMREt5UWhLWmJ4MmxNLVRzd3BZRlN3UGFxdFNwa25UejBQM3RrekNNeEpTcWdCZGxBbnVBaWNkaGVjVnZQS1dJdDlHOVREXzhZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;They had a fairytale American childhood - but was radiation slowly killing them?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Sophie Williams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Washington DC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/46d3/live/bdcabf60-ab4c-11ef-bdf5-b7cb2fa86e10.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Theo Welling A lone hooded figure stands by the banks of Coldwater Creek" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Theo Welling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Radioactive material was dumped near the creek after World War Two&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital’s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Doctors were shocked," she says. "We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kim’s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Zack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Years later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (£2bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Among the areas covered were parts of New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;St Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Decades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: "The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3aa1/live/93a56910-ab4c-11ef-a4fe-a3e9a6c5d640.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Theo Welling Karen Nickel stands in front of Coldwater Creek" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Theo Welling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Karen Nickel says growing up near Coldwater Creek was idyllic - but many locals ended up with rare cancers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My husband didn’t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we’re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral'," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Just streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America," says Karen. "Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers," she says. "We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can’t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Karen’s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen’s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Karen helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure," she says. "These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d17c/live/e350a780-ab4d-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Family handout Family handout image of Via Von Banks as a young woman" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Family handout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Via Von Banks, another local, was diagnosed with a form of motor neurone disease&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Teresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Years later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"ALS took my sister at 50," Teresa says.

The premise of [Acharya’s project] is incompatible with agency priorities, and no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DFY55SQ3JBA27DGB6HIZPVBJVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An NIH employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the subject, said that typically it would be up to the agency’s scientists to determine whether the scope of a grant needed to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJAJYYSSBZDIHEVRBHDRGBAZTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We are not being notified at all,” the employee said. “We have expertise in our areas of science specifically so we can negotiate those changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="5VS5HDQMNRDJHOSOSOQVWZBN3A" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="5VS5HDQMNRDJHOSOSOQVWZBN3A"&gt;Study suggests some ‘hesitancy’ may be warranted&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KE5MEDVWSFGIRAKWTZ2I3QXVNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy has called for more work into the safety of vaccines.

&lt;p&gt;Savage Pet of El Cajon, CA&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is recalling 66 Large Chicken Boxes 84 oz. and 74 Small Chicken Boxes 21 oz. with the lot code/best by date of 11152026 because it has the potential to contain &lt;em&gt;H5N1, also known as bird flu &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savage Cat Food Large Chicken Boxes and Small Chicken Boxes were distributed to retailers in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who fed cats the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with cats exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should immediately contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no human infections have been identified among people handling raw pet food products, humans can become infected if live virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth. People should wash their hands while handling raw products and sanitize contact surfaces. People who handled the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu, including eye redness or irritation (conjunctivitis), cough, sore throat, sneezing, runny/stuffy nose, muscle/body aches, headaches, fatigue, fever, trouble breathing, seizures, rash, diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting. People exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare provider and local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Savage Pet was made aware of one cat in Colorado who contracted H5N1, got sick and recovered. Colorado State University Laboratory tested sealed packets of Savage Cat Food using PCR testing for H5N1. The PCR test results were “non-negative”. The product with “non-negative” PCR results was sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product in question was removed from the market while awaiting final test results. On 02/17/25 every retailer who may have received the lot code in question was contacted and informed to return it for proper destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 03/06/25 the NVSL virus isolation testing results confirmed the virus to be negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 3/13/2025 Savage Pet was made aware of an additional case in New York of a kitten that was feeding lot 11152026 who contracted avian flu. Further testing is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure maximum safety we are modifying our market withdrawal to a recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product with lot code/best by date of 11152026 was distributed in November 2024. The boxes are cardboard and contain individual plastic packets inside. The lot code/best by date is stamped on the bottom and on each packet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not feed the recalled product to pets or animals. Do not sell or donate the recalled products. Consumers who have purchased this lot code are urged to immediately return it to their retailer for proper destruction and a full refund.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information contact us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@savagecatfood.com"&gt;info@savagecatfood.com&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 619.270.0295.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
