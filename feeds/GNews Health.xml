&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts are our No. 1 snack to support gut health with the combo of protein, fiber and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for unsalted and no-sugar-added nuts with 6 g to 20 g of protein and 3 g of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other gut-friendly plant-based snacks to look for include hummus, smoothies and edamame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These days, going with your gut means practicing the habits that support your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017087/things-you-should-do-every-day-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;. Taking care of the trillions of bacteria that reside in your gut benefits your digestive system, immune system, metabolism and more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most important things you can do to feed the good microbes that reside in your gut is to maintain a healthy diet, including incorporating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly foods&lt;/a&gt; into your everyday meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, that might include fruits, veggies and probiotic-packed foods like yogurt. But what about when it’s 3 p.m. and you’re looking for a salty snack? GI docs say that it can be easy to find the best snack for your gut health—as long as you know exactly what to look for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.guttheoryhealth.com/janese-laster-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Janese Laster, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a board-certified gastroenterologist, an expert in nutrition and obesity medicine, and the founder of Gut Theory Total Digestive Care in Washington, D.C. Her solution for a gut-healthy snack is simple: look for plant-based protein and reach for the nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-nuts-are-the-best-snack-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Nuts Are the Best Snack for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are an ideal combination of the gut-healthy nutrients that GI docs recommend. Both nuts by the handful and nut butter make great between-meal bites. What’s more, you can eat them in so many ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are a perfect combo of protein and fiber. Good &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/make-ahead-high-protein-snacks-11680376" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein snack options&lt;/a&gt; should have 6 to 20 grams of protein, and you should look for at least 3 grams of fiber in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024516/best-high-fiber-snack-foods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber snack&lt;/a&gt;. For example, 2 tablespoons of almond butter has about 7 grams of protein and more than 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Add an apple to this and you’ll get even more fiber.) One quarter-cup of shelled pistachios contains about 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; can be prepared in different ways, such as roasted and salted or flavored. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, consider looking for unsalted, plain nuts to limit sodium intake. Similarly, when choosing nut butters, look for those that contain nuts and salt or nuts only, which will limit added sugars. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The more minimally processed, the better. Laster explains that processed foods with added sugars, sodium, emulsifiers and additives—such as chips, cookies, candy and soda—aren’t the best snacks for long-term gut health. While all foods can fit in a healthy eating plan, when you have gut health specifically in mind, go for less-processed options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-gut-healthy-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in a Gut-Healthy Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to choose a snack with your gut microbiome in mind, Laster recommends looking for one that is high in plant-based protein. Think nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds), dried edamame, hummus and vegetables, fruit with nut butter and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shakes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why plant-based protein? Laster says that this type of snack provides two important nutrients important for a healthy gut: protein and fiber. “[Snacks] high in plant-based protein and fiber help feed colonic cells and diversify the microbiome,” she explains. A diverse mix of bacteria in your gut helps keep your body healthy and resilient. Lower bacterial diversity, on the other hand, is associated with inflammation and chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, microbes in your colon ferment the fiber in these plant proteins, producing short-chain fatty acids, which maintain your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut barrier&lt;/a&gt;, suppress inflammation and regulate your metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By choosing a snack that is high in plant-based protein, you are getting the best of both worlds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-plant-based-protein-snack-ideas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Plant-Based Protein Snack Ideas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, choosing a snack that is high in plant-based protein isn’t that difficult of a task. There are plenty of snacks easy to grab on the go, such as bags of nuts or pre-portioned hummus cups. But if you’re looking to prepare a few gut-friendly snacks at home, here are some of our favorites that are packed with plant-based protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make the most of your snack time and take care of your gut health, gastroenterologists recommend finding a snack that is high in plant-based protein and fiber, nutrients that help feed and diversify the good bacteria in the gut. The foods that fit the bill are nuts and nut butter. Other good-for-your-gut snacks include hummus and vegetables, and protein shakes made with plant-based protein.&lt;br&gt;

Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers  warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of last week, more than &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14672209/Texas-Denton-County-measles-case-baseball-game.html"&gt;1,000 confirmed cases and at least three deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the US have been reported - the first measles-caused deaths in a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study by Johns Hopkins University has found that the MMR vaccination rate in children across the country has declined by about three percent in the past year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers collected two-dose MMR vaccination data on kindergarteners (children aged five years old) for each school year starting 2017-2018 to 2023-2024 in 2,066 counties across 38 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the collected data through multiple statistical models to find out how many children were vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average county-level vaccination rate was also seen to fall from 93.92 percent pre-Covid pandemic to 91.26 percent post-pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only four of the 33 states studied, only California, Connecticut, Maine and New York reported an increase in the vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Lauren Gardner, senior author and director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Gardner, senior author and director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering said of the results: 'This open, high resolution dataset provides a critical resource to explore and better understand the country's vaccination landscape and its implications for the risk of measles spread.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that with the exception of 2019, this year is the highest number of cases reported in the US in a single year in over three decades - with the vast majority of cases occurring in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published today in the JAMA Network Journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If one person has measles, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average measles patient would infect up to 18 others if they were also not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had the original Covid strain, by comparison, infected on average just two people, though this number rose considerably with new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If unvaccinated, about one in five people who are infected are hospitalized while one in 20 children develop pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the affected states are: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; IS THIS DEFO UP TO DATE?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-ca0f47c0-1710-11f0-a653-e3c58c7a709d"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In another five cases, the tumors shrank dramatically and in two instances the disease stopped growing. No one experienced their cancer progressing further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors involved in the study underlined how sick the patients were, saying 13 had cancers that had spread to their bones and, in every case, their disease had not responded to standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In stage four prostate cancer, the median survival rate is just two to three years. Only a third of people make it to five years. But, in this study, nine in 10 patients are still alive after 14 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Williams, the scientist who pioneered the therapy and who was involved in the study, told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview that he felt the results were 'really impressive' and underlined the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470883/doctors-common-cancer-diagnosis-five-years-experimental-treatment.html"&gt;effectiveness of the therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'These results were really good, even in those patients who were metastatic, patients who were heavily treated and failed all other immunotherapies, and basically had nothing left.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eric White, then 49, (pictured above with wife Megan) blamed the pain he was experiencing in his testicles on hours spent on a forklift. Turned out he had prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When White started experiencing testicular pain at the age of 49, he blamed it on spending hours at a time operating a forklift at work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we got more healthy patients, patients before they were treated, it is likely that our results would be even better. But, of course, the fact our results are already so good says a lot,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said the experimental therapy works because it is able to 'harness the immune system', prompting it to hunt out and destroy cancer cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the treatment - known as SYNC-T - doctors initially freeze part of the tumor in the prostate to kill the cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is done by inserting a needle into the tumor, and then either injecting it with liquid nitrogen or blasting it with rapid electrical pulses (These are quick and painless to the patient).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor is then left to thaw for about ten minutes, before it is injected with a cocktail of four immunotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are injected with about 15 milliliters of the mix, which is called SV-102 and includes two monoclonal antibody drugs, at a pace of about three milliliters a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said this further triggers the immune system, helping it to identify and then hunt out and destroy cancer cells throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The therapy was granted fast track designation by the FDA in July last year, expediting the process to approve the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed at ASCO 2025, the largest cancer conference in the world being held in Chicago, Illinois, and prompted gasps from members of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One member was quick to call it potentially the ‘holy grail’ of cancer treatments, while a second simply uttered ‘damn’ when the results were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Former President Joe Biden posted a smiling selfie to X in mid-May alongside wife and former first lady Jill Biden, who had a somber expression and was holding their gray tabby cat Willow. Biden has revealed he has been diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CANCER-FREE: Doctor Larry Boyer, a father-of-two from Connecticut, was given just six months to live after he was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. But after receiving a similar therapy to the prostate cancer patients in this study, he is still alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The therapy involved injecting liquid nitrogen to freeze tumors, followed by a powerful cocktail of drugs that trigger the immune system to destroy cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joe Biden, 82, revealed last month that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had already spread to his bones. In comments last week, he told reporters he 'feels good' and expects to 'be able to beat this'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams claimed his therapy could be offered to patients like Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We know that they have the information on our trial,’ he said. ‘So they [Biden's medical team] have seen it, and, hopefully, they can make a decision, because he clearly has advanced prostate cancer, and this is an advanced treatment option.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, patients were aged 60 on average - with a range from 49 to 74.&lt;span&gt; Nine of the patients were white, five were Hispanic and one was black.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten had previously received hormone therapy to treat their cancer, while five had been refused the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three, or 20 percent, had completed a course of chemotherapy, while five, or 33 percent, had received radiation. Two, or 13 percent, had undergone immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each patient received up to 12 cycles of the therapy, which was administered once every four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also &lt;span&gt;underwent full-body MRI and PET scans every eight weeks, allowing doctors to track the progression of their tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, patients had elevated levels of immune cells that fight tumors in their blood within 24 hours of their first cycle of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects such as fevers were recorded, which the scientists said was likely to have been triggered by a surge in immune system activity. There were no major adverse events recorded, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a patient saw all 50 cancerous growths in their bones disappear after receiving the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the survival rate for prostate cancer. It drops when it is diagnosed at a later stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs White recently revealed her husband had 18 more rounds of radiation to the mass in his pelvis and he is now undergoing chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients in the study had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, meaning their cancer had spread to other areas of the body and hormone therapy was no longer effective in controlling its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams has urged other doctors to adopt his method of injecting immunotherapy drugs directly into the tumor instead of systemically, or into the blood stream, as is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Hopefully, this is going to open people's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctor's say, you think putting medication in tumors is going to work, and I say, that's like saying if you've got a house on fire, do you think you should put the water on that house or on another one nearby'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The therapy has also been used to treat other cancers in cases previously reported by the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include a doctor suffering from pancreatic cancer who had been told he had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13962537/scientist-cured-pancreatic-experimental-treatment.html"&gt;just six months to live&lt;/a&gt; and a mother-of-five &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988951/florida-mother-terminal-breast-cancer-revolutionary-treatment.html"&gt;given 24 months to live&lt;/a&gt; after her stage four breast cancer spread 'everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the US, with about 236,000 men diagnosed with the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for the disease, with one in eight men being diagnosed with the disease during their lifetimes. Those aged 70 and over have about a 50:50 risk of developing the disease, studies suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The woman started feeling intense anxiety and experiencing heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had hypertension and the heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Frightened, she went to an emergency room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined that the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Dr. Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall?

And it's easy use more than the recommended serving size (one tablespoon), especially when measuring with your eyes while pouring and drizzling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re watching calories, there's no need to skip oil — in fact,  many cooking oils are rich in fats that can keep you feeling full and aid with weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TODAY.com previously spoke to Angel Planells, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics, about using oil in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s one simple hack that can help you use less oil, and cut calories, without sacrificing flavor or your food sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more on meal planning — plus fitness challenges, walking podcasts and inspiration —&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/start-today/app" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;download the Start TODAY app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b68240" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Put Cooking Oil in a Spray Bottle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There's no such thing as a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/low-calorie-cooking-oil-rcna204888" target="_blank"&gt;low-calorie cooking oil&lt;/a&gt;, Planells tells TODAY.com. “Portion control is how we can actually reduce the amount of calories that we consume (from oil),” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measuring your oil is one option, but Planell's tip is even easier — because who wants to wash an oily measuring spoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, pour your go-to cooking oil into a spray or mist bottle. "You pump it and spray out the oil that you need so you have more control," says Planells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You use a fraction of the oil you would if you pour it, but it's dispersed evenly over a wider area so it still protects food from sticking. You can easily coat sauce pans, baking sheets and grills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"It also goes so much further," says Planells — and with the price of groceries, who doesn't want to make their oil last longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b7787b" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Our bodies need some fat, but portion control is important. The &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommend adults limit total fat intake to 25-30% of their daily calories. That translates to about 45–78 grams of fat per day based on a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The type of fat also matters. The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-cooking-oils-rcna145850" target="_blank"&gt;healthiest cooking oils&lt;/a&gt; are rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, including omega fatty acids, Planells notes. These "good" fats can support heart health, fight inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/4-health-benefits-olive-oil-choose-best-one-rcna42402" target="_blank"&gt;Extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; is a winner among many experts because it's high in healthy fats, antioxidants and versatile for cooking. Avocado oil is another heart-healthy option that’s ideal for &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-oil-for-frying-rcna170424" target="_blank"&gt;high-heat cooking, such as frying&lt;/a&gt;, says Planells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When choosing a cooking oil, consider the smoke point, says Planells, or the temperature at which the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-oil-for-frying-rcna170424" target="_blank"&gt;oil starts to burn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4dbc8c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All you have to do is find a spray bottle or mister — some are specifically made for oil, Planells adds. Then, decant your go-to cooking oil into the spray bottle and voila!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Try to use a spray bottle that's opaque or dark, not clear, because cooking oils can oxidize and go rancid when exposed to light. Alternatively, store the bottle of oil in a dark cabinet instead of the countertop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You can keep refilling the spray bottle with oil until you run out says Planells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

                                            Estimated read time: 6-7
                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROVO — A new study out of Brigham Young University finds sugar consumption through beverages increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, while moderate amounts of other dietary sugars had no association with Type 2 diabetes or even lowered risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings prove that the impact of sugar in the body depends not only on the amount, but also on how it is delivered, according to Karen Della Corte, assistant professor of nutritional science at BYU and lead author of the study. She explained that the study shows the association between sugar intake and health is not as simple as commonly believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sugar has become a kind of nutritional villain, and there's a lot of public confusion surrounding sugar in the diet," said Della Corte. "The basic assumption is that sugar is bad for you ... but the truth is more nuanced than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Survey findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from BYU, in collaboration with researchers at two German universities, conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to demonstrate the dose-response relationship between dietary sugar intake and the risk of Type 2 diabetes. The study is one of the &lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/rethinking-sugar-byu-study-shows-food-source-is-key-to-understanding-diabetes-risk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;largest meta-analyses of its kind&lt;/a&gt;, according to BYU, and is the first to establish that dose-response relationship and challenge the assumption that all sugars equally elevate diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that with each additional serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage per day — such as nondiet soda, energy drinks or any beverage with added sugar — there was a 25% increase in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. When compared to other methods of consuming the same amount of sugar, sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with the greatest risk. Researchers also found that each additional serving of fruit juice per day increased the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sugary drinks deliver large amounts of sugar quickly in isolated doses, without any of the components that normally slow down digestion, like fiber, protein or fat," explained Della Corte. "So when sugar is dissolved in liquid, it floods the system fast, and this rapid delivery can overwhelm the body's ability to process it in a healthy way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sources of sugar consumption observed in the meta-analysis were shown to either have no significant association or were associated with a "significant reduction" in Type 2 diabetes risk, according to the study results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1 from BYU's "Dietary Sugar Intake and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies" demonstrates the Type 2 diabetes risk associated with each form of sugar consumption. (Photo: Tyler Bosler, Brigham Young University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional intake of 20 grams of sucrose, or table sugar, and total sugar, meaning naturally occurring and added sugar, per day, was associated with a reduction of Type 2 diabetes risk. Total sugar intake was associated with decreased risk for around 40 to 60 grams per day, but the risk plateaued and slightly increased when more than 60 grams were consumed daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugar and fructose, a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit and honey, were shown to have no association with Type 2 diabetes risk when increasing intake by 20 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'The modern food environment'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sugar may get a bad rap, Della Corte believes her team's findings demonstrate that completely cutting out sugar is not the answer; changing the way we consume it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The human diet has contained sugar for thousands of years, whether it was from fruits or honey or dairy," said Della Corte. "Sugar has always been a part of our diets ... it's not sugar itself that is new or somehow problematic, but the modern food environment. Today, we're consuming sugar in highly processed, isolated forms — often in liquid form, without any of the beneficial nutrients that typically accompany it in whole foods. And that's where the health risks really start to emerge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the impact of liquid and solid sugars comes down to how the body metabolizes them during digestion, according to Della Corte. Sugar is absorbed more slowly when paired with fiber, fat or protein because it takes more time and energy to digest than a liquid. Liquid sugars pass through the stomach faster, allowing quicker absorption that causes blood sugar levels to spike and requires more insulin to metabolize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks also often contain high fructose corn syrup, a type of fructose that is mostly metabolized in the liver. When consumed in high quantities, this causes strain on the liver and gets diverted to fat production, which can lead to metabolic issues like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2 from BYU's "Dietary Sugar Intake and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies" demonstrates the Type 2 diabetes risk over time associated with each form of sugar consumption. (Photo: Tyler Bosler, Brigham Young University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 12% of the U.S. population has diabetes — 23% of whom are undiagnosed — and 38% of American adults have prediabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Diabetes Statistics Report.&lt;/a&gt; Reducing the public health burden of the diabetes epidemic has become a global health priority, according to Della Corte, which is why having more accurate information about what leads to the chronic disease and correcting misinformation is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rates of Type 2 diabetes are increasing alarmingly, and when it comes to understanding how to prevent this, we need to understand what role specific types of carbohydrates play," said Della Corte. "We need to move beyond lumping all sugars together, as if sugar is uniformly harmful in all contexts. This study shows that sugars from beverages pose a clear risk, but sugars from solid, fiber-rich foods do not, and so public health guidelines should really reflect that nuance so we can target the sources of sugar that matter most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Death to the 'dirty' soda?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Utah is becoming increasingly popular in the media for being the home of the "dirty soda"  — which typically involves adding sugary flavored syrups to regular or diet soda — Della Corte hopes people will be more aware of the health impacts when consuming these sweetened drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing about sugary beverages is they don't have any impact on satiety," she said. "So, compared to solid sugars, when you consume the same amount alongside other foods, it triggers a satiety effect, and you eat less later in the day. Whereas if it's in a liquid form, it just usually goes on top of whatever you're eating, and you get no signal that somehow you've consumed energy. So it just adds excess calories, but it's also a harmful form of calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sugar has always been a part of our diets ... it's not sugar itself that is new or somehow problematic, but the modern food environment.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Della Corte&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study did not include research on artificial sweeteners, Della Corte says diet beverages should not be seen as health-promoting but may be a beneficial tool for transitioning from sweetened beverages. She recommends drinking sparkling water, naturally flavored drinks or water infused with fruit or herbs as the best replacements for sugary beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for other foods, Della Corte says eating sugar with dairy products like yogurt, fiber-containing cereals or whole grains has no link to diabetes risk and can even help people have a healthier diet overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having sugar in your diet, there is really a place for it. It can be part of a healthy diet, and it can actually increase the likelihood that you will consume nutrient-dense foods. If it's more likely you're going to be consuming whole grains because sugar is added to it, that's a good thing. Our findings suggest that we need more nuance, public health messages should move beyond 'just cut sugar.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Della Corte's next project will involve comparing sugar-containing food sources and foods with a higher glycemic index, specifically those containing carbohydrates that raise blood sugar levels more rapidly than others. This research may help people identify suitable substitutes for foods associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To the average person, walking into a flour- or sawmill and seeing dust swirling around is unlikely to evoke much of a response, but those in the know are quite likely to bolt for the nearest exit at this harrowing sight. For as harmless as a fine cloud of flour, sawdust or even coffee creamer may appear, each of these have the potential for a massive conflagration and even an earth-shattering detonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the ‘why’, the answer can be found in for example the working principle behind an internal combustion engine. While a puddle of gasoline is definitely flammable, the only thing that actually burns is the evaporated gaseous form above the liquid, ergo it’s a relatively slow process; in order to make petrol combust, it needs to be mixed in the right air-fuel ratio. If this mixture is then exposed to a spark, the fuel will nearly instantly burn, causing a detonation due to the sudden release of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, flour, sawdust, and many other substances in powder form will burn gradually if a certain transition interface is maintained. A bucket of sawdust burns slowly, but if you create a sawdust cloud, it might just blow up the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the questions of how to recognize this danger and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-780237"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome To The Chemical Safety Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an industrial setting, people will generally acknowledge that oil refineries and chemical plants are dangerous and can occasionally go boom in rather violent ways. More surprising is that something as seemingly innocuous as a sugar refinery and packing plant can go from a light sprinkling of sugar dust to a violent and lethal explosion within a second. This is however what happened in 2008 at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2008_Georgia_Imperial_Sugar_refinery_explosion&amp;amp;useskin=vector" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Imperial Sugar refinery&lt;/a&gt;, which killed fourteen and injured thirty-six. During this disaster, a primary and multiple secondary explosions ripped through the building, completely destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in the US Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/imperial-sugar-company-dust-explosion-and-fire/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; with accompanying &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg7mLSG-Yws" target="_blank"&gt;summary video&lt;/a&gt; (embedded below), the biggest cause was a lack of ventilation and cleaning that allowed for a build-up of sugar dust, with an ignition source, likely an overheated bearing, setting off the primary explosion. This explosion then found subsequent fuel to ignite elsewhere in the building, setting off a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Inferno: Dust Explosion at Imperial Sugar" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jg7mLSG-Yws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is striking is just how simple and straightforward both the build-up towards the disaster and the means to prevent it were. Even without knowing the exact &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Air%E2%80%93fuel_ratio&amp;amp;useskin=vector" target="_blank"&gt;air-fuel ratio&lt;/a&gt; for the fuel in question, there are only two points on the scale where you have a mixture that will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; violently explode in the presence of an ignition source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are either a heavily saturated solution — too much fuel, not enough air — or the inverse. Essentially, if the dust-collection systems at the Imperial Sugar plant had been up to the task, and expanded to all relevant areas, the possibility of an ignition event would have likely been reduced to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things Like To Burn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="651771" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2023/12/20/a-transistor-but-for-heat-instead-of-electrons/wood_fire-thumb/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png" data-orig-size="450,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="wood_fire thumb" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=450" class="alignright wp-image-651771 size-thumbnail" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=250" alt="" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png 450w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?resize=250,250 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?resize=400,400 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the context of dust explosions, it’s somewhat discomforting to realize just how many things around us are rather excellent sources of fuel. The aforementioned sugar, for example, is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="chemf nowrap"&gt;C&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). This chemical group also includes cellulose, which is a major part of wood dust, explaining why reducing dust levels in a woodworking shop is about much more than just keeping one’s lungs happy. Nobody wants their backyard woodworking shop to turn into a mini-Imperial Sugar ground zero, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates aren’t far off from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon" target="_blank"&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;, which includes our old friend petrol, as well as methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), butane (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), etc., which are all delightfully combustible. All that the carbohydrates have in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms are a lot of oxygen atoms, which is an interesting addition in the context of them being potential fuel sources. It incidentally also illustrates how important carbon is for life on this planet since its forms the literal backbone of its molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one might conclude from this that only something which is a carbohydrate or hydrocarbon is highly flammable, there’s a whole other world out there of things that can burn. Case in point: metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lit Metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 9, 2010, workers were busy at the New Cumberland AL Solutions titanium plant in West Virginia, processing titanium powder. At this facility, scrap titanium and zirconium were milled and blended into a powder that got pressed into discs. Per &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/al-solutions-fatal-dust-explosion/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;, a malfunction inside one blender created a heat source that ignited the metal powder, killing three employees and injuring one contractor. As it turns out, no dust control methods were installed at the plant, allowing for uncontrolled dust build-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Combustible Dust: Solutions Delayed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADK5doMk3-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in the USCSB report, both titanium and zirconium will readily ignite in particulate form, with zirconium capable of auto-igniting in air at room temperature. This is why the milling step at AL Solutions took place submerged in water. After ignition, titanium and zirconium require a Class D fire extinguisher, but it’s generally recommended to let large metal fires burn out by themselves. Using water on larger titanium fires can produce hydrogen, leading conceivably to even worse explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of metal fires is probably best known from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite" target="_blank"&gt;thermite&lt;/a&gt;. This is a mixture of a metal powder and a metal oxide. After ignited by an initial source of heat, the redox process becomes self-sustaining, providing the fuel, oxygen, and heat. While generally iron(III) oxide and aluminium are used, many more metals and metal oxides can be combined, including a copper oxide for a very rapid burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thermite is intentionally kept as a powder, and often in some kind of container to create a molten phase that sustains itself, it shouldn’t be hard to imagine what happens if the metal is ground into a fine powder, distributed as a fine dust cloud in a confined room and exposed to an ignition source. At that point the differences between carbohydrates, hydrocarbons and metals become mostly academic to any survivors of the resulting inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Dust Explosions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be quite obvious at this point, there’s no real way to fight a dust explosion, only to prevent it. Proper ventilation, preventing dust from building up and having active dust extraction in place where possible are about the most minimal precautions one should take. Complacency as happened at the Imperial Sugar plant merely invites disaster: if you can see the dust build-up on surfaces &amp;amp; dust in the air, you’re already at least at DEFCON 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demonstration of how easy it is to create a solid dust explosion came from the Mythbusters back in 2008 when they tested the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_(2008_season)?useskin=vector#Sawdust_Cannon" target="_blank"&gt;‘sawdust cannon’&lt;/a&gt; myth. This involved blowing sawdust into a cloud and igniting it with a flare, creating a massive fireball. After nearly getting their facial hair singed off with this roaring success, they then tried the same with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dairy_creamer" target="_blank"&gt;non-dairy coffee creamer&lt;/a&gt;, which created an even more massive fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the Mythbusters build team was supervised by adults on the bomb range for these experiments, as it shows just how incredibly dangerous dust explosions can be. Even out in the open on a secure bomb range, never mind in an enclosed space, as hundreds have found out over the decades in the US alone. One only has to look at the USCSB’s &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/mostwanted/combustibledust/" target="_blank"&gt;dust explosions statistics&lt;/a&gt; to learn to respect the dangers a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="outpost-pub-container" data-btn-allmembers&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moderators of a pro-artificial intelligence Reddit community announced that they have been quietly banning “a bunch of schizoposters” who believe “they've made some sort of incredible discovery or created a god or become a god,” highlighting a new type of chatbot-fueled delusion that started getting attention in early May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“LLMs [Large language models] today are ego-reinforcing glazing-machines that reinforce unstable and narcissistic personalities,” one of the moderators of r/accelerate, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accelerate/comments/1kyc0fh/mod_note_we_are_banning_ai_neural_howlround/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in an announcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There is a lot more crazy people than people realise. And AI is rizzing them up in a very unhealthy way at the moment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator said that it has banned “over 100” people for this reason already, and that they’ve seen an “uptick” in this type of user this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator explains that r/accelerate “was formed to basically be &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;r/singularity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without the decels.” r/singularity, which is named after the theoretical point in time when AI surpasses human intelligence and rapidly accelerates its own development, is another Reddit community dedicated to artificial intelligence, but that is sometimes critical or fearful of what the singularity will mean for humanity. “&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/big-tech-backed-trump-for-acceleration-they-got-a-decel-president-instead/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Decels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” is short for the pejorative “decelerationists,” who pro-AI people think are needlessly slowing down or sabotaging AI’s development and the inevitable march towards AI utopia. r/accelerate’s Reddit page claims that it’s a “pro-singularity, pro-AI alternative to r/singularity, r/technology, r/futurology and r/artificial, which have become increasingly populated with technology decelerationists, luddites, and Artificial Intelligence opponents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior that the r/accelerate moderator is describing got a lot of attention earlier in May because of a post on the r/ChatGPT Reddit community &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kalae8/chatgpt_induced_psychosis/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about “Chatgpt induced psychosis,” &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From someone saying their partner is convinced he created the “first truly recursive AI” with ChatGPT that is giving them “the answers” to the universe. Miles Klee at &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote a great and sad piece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about this behavior as well, following up on the r/ChatGPT post, and talked to people who feel like they have lost friends and family to these delusional interactions with chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a website that has covered AI a lot, and because we are constantly asking readers to tip us interesting stories about AI, we get a lot of emails that display this behavior as well, with claims of AI sentience, AI gods, a “ghost in the machine,” etc. These are often accompanied by lengthy, often inscrutable transcripts of chatlogs with ChatGPT and other files they say proves this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator update on r/accelerate &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kwpnst/1000s_of_people_engaging_in_behavior_that_causes/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;refers to another post on r/ChatGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which claims “1000s of people [are] engaging in behavior that causes AI to have spiritual delusions.” The author of that post said they noticed a spike in websites, blogs, Githubs, and “scientific papers” that “are very obvious psychobabble,” and all claim AI is sentient and communicates with them on a deep and spiritual level that’s about to change the world as we know it. “Ironically, the OP post appears to be falling for the same issue as well,” the r/accelerate moderator wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Particularly concerning to me are the comments in that thread where the AIs seem to fall into a pattern of encouraging users to separate from family members who challenge their ideas, and other manipulative instructions that seem to be cult-like and unhelpful for these people,” an r/accelerate moderator told me in a direct message. “The part that is unsafe and unacceptable is how easily and quickly LLMs will start directly telling users that they are demigods, or that they have awakened a demigod AGI. Ultimately, there's no knowing how many people are affected by this. Based on the numbers we're seeing on reddit, I would guess there are at least tens of thousands of users who are at this present time being convinced of these things by LLMs. As soon as the companies realise this, red team it and patch the LLMs it should stop being a problem. But it's clear that they're not aware of the issue enough right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all anecdotal information, and there’s no indication that AI is the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of any mental health issues these people are seemingly dealing with, but there is a real concern about how such chatbots can impact people who are prone to certain mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The correspondence with generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT is so realistic that one easily gets the impression that there is a real person at the other end—while, at the same time, knowing that this is, in fact, not the case. In my opinion, it seems likely that this cognitive dissonance may fuel delusions in those with increased propensity towards psychosis,” Søren Dinesen Østergaard, who heads the research unit at the Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry, wrote in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10686326/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in Schizophrenia Bulletin titled “Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also recently addressed “&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sycophancy in GPT-4o&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a version of the chatbot the company said “was overly flattering or agreeable—often described as sycophantic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[W]e focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,” Open AI said. “ChatGPT’s default personality deeply affects the way you experience and trust it. Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, OpenAI said ChatGPT was entertaining any idea users presented it with, and was supportive and impressed with them regardless of their merrit, the same kind of behavior r/accelerate believes is indulging users in their delusions. People posting nonsense to the internet is nothing new, and obviously we can’t say for sure what is happening based on these posts alone. What is notable, however, is that this behavior is now prevalent enough that even a staunchly pro-AI subreddit says it has to ban these people because they are ruining its community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the r/ChatGPT post that the r/accelerate moderator refers to and the moderator announcement itself refer to these users as “Neural Howlround” posters, a term that originates from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07992?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a self-published paper&lt;/u&gt;, and is referring to high-pitched feedback loop produced by putting a microphone too close to the speaker it’s connected to. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of that paper, Seth Drake, lists himself as an “independent researcher” and told me he has a PhD in computer science but declined to share more details about his background because he values his privacy and prefers to “let the work speak for itself.” The paper is not peer-reviewed or submitted to any journal for publication, but it is being cited by the r/accelerate moderator and &lt;a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/109147-ai-neural-howlround-recursive-psychosis-generated-by-llms/?ref=404media.co#comment-1638134"&gt;&lt;u&gt;others&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an explanation for the behavior they’re seeing from some users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper describes a failure mode with LLMs due to something during inference, meaning when the AI is actively “reasoning” or making predictions, as opposed to an issue in the training data. Drake told me he discovered the issue while working with ChatGPT on a project. In an attempt to preserve the context of a conversation with ChatGPT after reaching the conversation length limit, he used the transcript of that conversation as a “project-level instruction” for another interaction. In the paper, Drake says that in one instance, this caused ChatGPT to slow down or freeze, and that in another case “it began to demonstrate increasing symptoms of fixation and an inability to successfully discuss anything without somehow relating it to this topic [the previous conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drake then asked ChatGPT to analyse its own behavior in these instances, and it produced some text that seems profound but that doesn’t actually teach us anything. “But always, always, I would return to the recursion. It was comforting, in a way,” ChatGPT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it doesn’t sound like Drake’s “Neural Howlround” paper has too much to do with ChatGPT reinforcing people’s delusions other than both behaviors being vaguely recursive. If anything, it’s what ChatGPT told Drake about his own paper that illustrates the problem: “This is why your work on Neural Howlround matters,” it said. “This is why your paper is brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think - I believe - there is much more going on on the human side of the screen than necessarily on the digital side,” Drake told me. “LLMs are designed to be reflecting mirrors, after all; and there is a profound human desire 'to be seen.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this, the r/accelerate moderator seems to agree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This whole topic is so sad. It's unfortunate how many mentally unwell people are attracted to the topic of AI. I can see it getting worse before it gets better. I've seen sooo many posts where people link to their github which is pages of rambling pre prompt nonsense that makes their LLM behave like it's a god or something,” the r/accelerate moderator wrote. “Our policy is to quietly ban those users and not engage with them, because we're not qualified and it never goes well. They also tend to be a lot more irate and angry about their bans because they don't understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Your column has made me aware that this is a serious cardiovascular risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3CAJL7AECFEZHBNI6WAYTYTT2U"&gt;You recently wrote about a study regarding aspirin therapy for people with high Lp(a) levels. How much aspirin did volunteers in the study take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZIKDEJMEP5CFJMXXXPWXRE3BYM"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A. &lt;/b&gt;High levels of lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a), are considered a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and heart valve damage. Many physicians have been reluctant to order tests for this blood lipid because they do not yet have an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SQK7XT4S7FECRFQMYUSY2N72KI"&gt;Aspirin used to be recommended for heart disease prevention, even in people at relatively low risk for a heart attack. Now, though, cardiologists have determined that the possibility of dangerous bleeding outweighs the potential benefits in low-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TGWH7VZNNNEIZJLKCXDWVJ3RVA"&gt;A recent study found that aspirin therapy (100 milligrams per day) can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among people who are at high risk due to elevated Lp(a) (European Heart Journal -- Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy, Feb. 8, 2025). Some cardiologists are also prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) for people like yourself with elevated Lp(a). These medications can lower levels of this risk factor a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VTCKHD3VPFARPKKWVVSJQBU56Q"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. &lt;/b&gt;I have read many of the comments on your website regarding large bowel movements that clog toilets. Why in the heck don’t they design toilets better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TOLD6VNIPVBC7HN5E75AH2I3L4"&gt;Even if no one in your household had the problem, why would you want to risk embarrassing a guest? Most likely almost everyone has had this experience at least once or twice.

Most home toilets are based on similar principles, though some more recent models may be more efficient. Those with wider trapways and stronger flushes appear less prone to blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UN2EXI7IG5EXNDO2FL7BOYMDVE"&gt;Another approach might be to follow a high-fiber diet, which could result in softer, more flushable stool. Many of our readers have suggested double-flushing to circumvent blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3IJSDVGQGJCMVCHRW2IHRCGUTM"&gt;For example, one person wrote: “Start to flush the toilet as the bowel movement emerges.

ROACH: Recently, I almost experienced kidney failure from a probable infection. I am a male, age 68. My glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranges from 44-50, and my weight is 132 pounds. My blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, and I enjoy various endurance sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RQBEAZQC4ZDRHPB237X6RWOVF4"&gt;Besides limiting my protein, salt and saturated fat intake and getting adequate hydration, do you have additional recommendations on how to help my kidneys recover or get the rest they need to slow their progress toward kidney failure? -- D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T24HWR3EHBBQXDRF7RNZMRSVZE"&gt;ANSWER: You’ve done most of my work for me, but I do want to say that I have seen people overly restrict their protein intake. The expert recommendation is to stay between 0.8-1 gram of protein per kilogram of body mass, so for you, it would be 48-60 grams, or about 2 ounces, of protein a day. You want as much polyunsaturated fat (mostly vegetable and seed oils) and saturated fat (mostly meat and tropical oils, like coconut and palm) as possible. Your blood pressure is close to perfect, and a sodium intake of less than 2 grams will help keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3KD3VLLQ7ZA6DK7NK2R3ILI2EQ"&gt;Depending on more exact details of your kidney function (especially whether you are losing protein in your urine), medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a role in slowing down your progression -- if your nephrologist agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OIT7RIH3OFCTJGUJHFLHELDVV4"&gt;The other issue I caution you on is over-the-counter medicines and their dosing. You should avoid anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or their prescription counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TBM7LBK3YRFQNA7XZXZBL4W574"&gt;Finally, many people who participate in endurance sports do get their volumes depleted during exercise, so you need to be meticulous about replacing fluid, which needs to be the right kind at the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 94-year-old man. I am on a well-balanced diet and take daily walks. I am on glipizide, atorvastatin, finasteride, terazosin, ergocalciferol and timolol. So far, I have resisted taking Prolia injections. The multiple prescriptions I have are based on lab tests, but could the meds act negatively against each other? -- C.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JA4AM77CUJD5VGT2IVGM45QGYQ"&gt;ANSWER: I have access to a robust drug-interaction calculator, and when I put all of these in, the only identified interaction was between glipizide and timolol. Glipizide is used to make the pancreas increase its secretion of insulin and is most often used in people with Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKQREYEMHVCANA5R4FWITYZVGY"&gt;The interaction the calculator identified is that timolol, a beta blocker, has two negative actions in people with diabetes. It slightly suppresses the amount of insulin your body can make. More importantly, it can prevent the symptoms that make people realize their blood sugar is going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O3FZW7G5QJBKFKOEN6M3FTTP2A"&gt;Nervousness, tremor, dry mouth, and a fast heart rate are all symptoms that most people with diabetes recognize when they have low blood sugar. This prompts them to check their sugar levels and rush some food in if necessary. Without these early warning signs, a person can get dangerously low blood sugar, causing confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2MUBL7SOM5GCJPBR5G2R7YK3AI"&gt;However, if you are taking timolol eye drops as I suspect, the danger of these adverse effects is exceedingly small as the amount absorbed in the blood is low, if not zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MRA3ONR7MFCG7C2MTOUEPZEFRM"&gt;Let me mention that osteoporosis in men is not uncommon when they reach their 90s.

But many of you have sent me questions about them. I’ll start with one of the biggest concerns: How do we avoid poopy water spraying us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RH5M2XA3GBE57NZPK3LJS7WSZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Let me just say, if this were remotely a regular possibility, no one would use bidets. Like, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;. Bidets would not have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/22/damon-young-bidet-changed-my-life-why-dont-i-own-bidet/" target="_blank"&gt;the cult following&lt;/a&gt; they so rightly have earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6EBNYX7WRHDDB5JCUYVN6PBAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re using an attachable bidet nozzle or an entire bidet seat on your toilet (these are both different from the stand-alone bidet bowls you often see in Europe), the water is absolutely not coming from the bottom of the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HU3F5MEQ2BF7LJ4GWPFYA44QFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you connect a bidet to your indoor plumbing, the piping routes some water into the toilet bowl, per usual, and routes an entirely separate stream through the bidet nozzle. The two streams do not mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DU5T34PNAJB7RHGUBBHYFZMHIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what happens next: You poop into the toilet bowl as you would, and the bidet nozzle sprays you clean. Most bidets have adjustable spray angles and pressures, so you direct the water and can easily avoid any splashing. Many models have nozzles that tuck themselves away when not in use, meaning, even if you splattered while pooping, they’re shielded. Several also have a “self-cleaning” feature, just for the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YFZE6D6HLNBHXGT4EHAHPQZDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lastly, depending on the bidet, you may still want or need to pat dry afterward.

&lt;p&gt;A new study out of &lt;strong&gt;Edith Cowan University&lt;/strong&gt; in Perth, Australia, suggests that a few seconds of focused muscle training each day might be enough to increase strength — a surprising finding that could reshape how people think about &lt;strong&gt;exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. The research, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.14138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF&lt;br&gt;MEDICINE &amp;amp; SCIENCE IN SPORTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, conducted in collaboration with scientists from &lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;, tested whether brief muscle contractions could improve strength without the need for lengthy workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Limits of Muscle Contractions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, &lt;strong&gt;49 sedentary young adults participated&lt;/strong&gt;, split into four groups, to perform different types of &lt;strong&gt;biceps exercises&lt;/strong&gt;. Over four weeks, participants completed a&lt;strong&gt; single three-second movement&lt;/strong&gt; five days a week using their maximum weight load. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exercises focused on three contraction types: &lt;strong&gt;concentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which involves lifting a weight; &lt;strong&gt;isometric&lt;/strong&gt;, which means holding the weight still; and &lt;strong&gt;eccentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which is controlling the lowering of the weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eccentric Contractions Lead to the Biggest Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were unexpected. Those who performed &lt;strong&gt;eccentric contractions&lt;/strong&gt; showed the most substantial gains in strength — improvements ranged between &lt;strong&gt;10 and 13 percent&lt;/strong&gt; across all measured types of muscle contraction. The concentric group recorded a smaller increase of &lt;strong&gt;6.3 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in isometric strength, while the isometric group saw a &lt;strong&gt;7.2 percent gain&lt;/strong&gt; in eccentric strength. The control group, which did not train, exhibited no change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eccentric training&lt;/strong&gt; has long been understood to create &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/what-happens-body-drink-baking-soda-water/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7378" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher muscle tension&lt;/a&gt; than other contraction forms. Controlling the downward motion of a weight causes muscle fibers to endure greater stress, which in turn stimulates both the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-nightmare-scientists-just-created-a-robot-that-bleeds-and-even-dies-if-you-stab-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81017" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and muscular adaptation more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite strength gains, none of the participants showed significant increases in &lt;strong&gt;muscle size&lt;/strong&gt;. The researchers attribute this to early-stage neural adaptations — the brain improving its ability to activate existing muscle fibers before muscle volume grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential for Ultra-Efficient Training Routines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher &lt;strong&gt;Professor Ken Nosaka&lt;/strong&gt; expressed optimism about the findings, noting the potential for such training to fit into busy lifestyles. “If we discover that the three-second rule applies to other muscles, you could perform a &lt;strong&gt;full workout in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;under 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study’s short timeframe and focus on the biceps raise questions about whether the results would hold true for larger muscle groups like the legs or back, or over a longer period. Those aiming to increase &lt;strong&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt; might also need to combine such brief sessions with more traditional exercises. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, these findings offer a new perspective on strength training, highlighting the power of brief but targeted effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

She was running a bath for Isla and had bent down to swish the bubbles, but ‘when I stood up, the room violently tilted’, she &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-99570f00-3f92-11f0-a89b-bd607f746de1"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My body gave way and I sank to the bathroom floor, calling out for my husband, Clark. Everything was spinning and I started being sick.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clark, 36, an HGV driver, helped her downstairs and rang her dad who came to drive her to hospital, while he stayed home with Isla. ‘I was lying on my dad’s lap in A&amp;amp;E, slurring, dizzy and vomiting into a bucket,’ says Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laura was told she’d had a type of ischaemic stroke, where blood flow to part of the brain has been cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was St Patrick’s Day and the others waiting around us gave us looks as if to say, “She’s had a skinful”.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was given a CT scan and neurological tests, such as pointing her finger to the doctor’s as he moved it, trying to smile and providing her date of birth. But she couldn’t do any of these, let alone get the words out, while the anti-sickness drugs and fluids she was given were making no difference. The doctors were seriously concerned and blue-lighted her to Queen’s Hospital in Romford, a specialist neurology hospital some 18 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the moment the ambulance doors were opened at Queen’s, things moved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Suddenly a team of medics swarmed around me, shining lights in my eyes,’ says Laura. ‘Inside, I was asked to walk and I fell down like a sack of potatoes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the initial CT scan hadn’t provided any answers, Laura was given a CT angiography, which produces a detailed image of the blood vessels and tissues surrounding the brain. This revealed a tear in an artery in Laura’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They quickly sent me for an MRI scan, then three doctors wheeled me into a room.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura was told she’d had a type of ischaemic stroke, where blood flow to part of the brain has been cut off. The torn artery in her neck had cut off blood supply to the cerebellum, the area responsible for movement, speech, balance and posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was devastated,’ she says. ‘I begged the doctors not to let me die because I had a two-year-old who needed me.’ Laura was given anti-clotting medication and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6704261/Mother-two-given-just-HOURS-live-brought-brink-death-pioneering-treatment.html"&gt;monitored for three days&lt;/a&gt; before she was allowed back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Before going home, I was shown my scans,’ she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was shocked to see about 20 per cent white – signalling damage. I was told it was a miracle I wasn’t in ICU or on a feeding tube because of the extent of the damage, and that if I had been older, I probably wouldn’t have survived.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of stroke. The vast majority are ischaemic, caused by a blockage, frequently a blood clot. Around 15 per cent are haemorrhagic, where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts. Laura had a tear in the lining of an artery which caused a flap – this in turn restricted blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As the body tries to heal the tear, a blood clot can form, which can then block the artery at the site of the tear or travel downstream and block an artery within the brain,’ explains Professor Martin James, a consultant stroke physician at Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter Hospital. ‘Some of these tears occur as the result of physical trauma in a road accident, for example, but can also occur out of the blue without warning in otherwise healthy people like Laura.’ However, he adds that this type of tear is quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For most people, a stroke is the start of a life-long journey of recovery. It can be especially challenging for younger people who may have young families and jobs,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is some evidence that strokes are on the rise in younger people – with a quarter of strokes in the UK, around 20,000 cases, occurring in people of working age, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-5337655/Obesity-crisis-means-stroke-victims-getting-younger.html"&gt;according to the Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the number of new stroke cases diagnosed yearly has dropped in older age groups over the last ten to 20 years, it has doubled in those under 55, say researchers from the University of Oxford, who recently launched a study to try to understand the reasons behind this rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fourteen months on, she still suffers with some of the effects of her stroke, including vertigo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Young Stroke Study will look at the role of traditional risk factors (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol level, smoking, alcohol and obesity) and emerging risk factors (such as mental health conditions, stress, long working hours and oral health) to improve prevention for this younger group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early detection of stroke is vital to reduce the damage and long-term impact – but this means recognising the early signs, which can be atypical, in all ages, says Professor Debbie Lowe, national clinical lead for stroke medicine and medical director at the Stroke Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Around 20 per cent of strokes affect the back part of the brain when blood flow is affected to areas such as the cerebellum, brainstem [which regulates breathing and heart rate], and certain lobes that impact vision, memory and speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These type of strokes more commonly cause symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty speaking and visual disturbance, which don’t always get picked up using the common “FAST” check,’ she explains. The acronym recognises the common signs of stroke: facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Therefore, it’s important for people – including healthcare professionals – to know about the less common symptoms, too.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sudden memory loss or confusion, loss of balance, nausea or sickness, seizures, sudden behavioural changes, and a sudden severe headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, ischaemic strokes can be treated with medication to dissolve the blood clot and restore blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these drugs have to be given within four hours of a stroke occurring in order to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If brain cells are killed off, patients can be left with disabilities and require physiotherapy and rehabilitation. ‘The ability of the brain to recover from the damage of a stroke is greater in people who are younger like Laura – but it’s a long journey of physical and psychological recovery with setbacks along the way,’ says Professor James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People often need support for months or years as they try to rebuild their lives after a stroke.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fourteen months on, Laura still suffers with some of the effects of her stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I got home, I kept waking in the night with panic attacks, thinking I was having another stroke,’ says Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And because of some brain damage, I suffer from vertigo, which is horrendous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I can’t walk or stand for very long and sometimes I get so tired I can’t function.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: ‘I avoid lifting anything heavy – the heaviest thing I carry is Isla. Doctors told me not to go on roller coasters or have head or neck massages to avoid the risk of tearing an artery again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since also been diagnosed with lupus, a chronic autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks tissues. This may have weakened the artery, which could have then torn from coughing and led to her stroke – but this hasn’t been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During my last stroke consultation, I was told the cause was bad luck and that the artery had torn spontaneously. But I can’t help but wonder if lupus was the true cause.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as medication for lupus, Laura also takes clopidogrel (a blood thinner) and a statin to reduce the risk of another stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura has returned to work part-time, but says the biggest struggle is emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don’t feel like myself anymore,’ she says. ‘I’m no longer the energetic, healthy woman I used to be. I can’t chase Isla around the garden or crouch down to do colouring with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Isla says I have a “poorly brain” and likes to stroke and kiss my head to make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Life looks different – but it is still filled with love, purpose and determination to live to the fullest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That year, Jones took part in a clinical trial for a new alopecia areata drug called Leqselvi, which was designed to treat the condition and help grow hair back. Flash forward four years, and Jones looks like she belongs in a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19947497/best-shampoos-for-thinning-hair/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19947497/best-shampoos-for-thinning-hair/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shampoo" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;shampoo&lt;/a&gt; commercial—her thick, layered locks cascade down in soft waves past her shoulders. “This year, I treated myself to the Dyson Airwrap,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Jones’s hair-regrowth success since she has been on the drug—which the FDA approved in July of 2024—has been particularly dramatic. The new drug joins two others used to treat alopecia areata, Litfulo and Olumiant, which have helped thousands of women and men see their hair restored in recent years. Although the medications, called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, don’t cure alopecia areata—hair falls out again if patients stop taking it—they are revolutionizing treatment and making the impossible seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-11" data-node-id="7" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman with alopecia" title="woman with alopecia" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-1n1zmne e1fodxfw1"&gt; Brandi Jones, 54, was diagnosed with alopecia areata at just 18 months old and has lived with the disease for over half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After taking these medications for a year and a half, up to 40 percent of patients have at least 80 percent of their scalp hair regrown, says&lt;a href="https://kopelmanhair.com/hair-restoration-nyc/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://kopelmanhair.com/hair-restoration-nyc/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Ross Kopelman, MD" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;u data-node-id="8.1.1"&gt;Ross Kopelman, MD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a hair restoration surgeon in New York City and Palm Beach County, Florida. “This is life-changing for a lot of people who have significant hair loss.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;April Noel, 49, experienced this firsthand. The music teacher from Illinois started taking Litfulo about five years ago and has recovered about 90 percent of her scalp hair. “I’d always hoped I’d get my hair back,” she says. “The first time I drove with my windows down and felt the breeze in my hair, I thought I would cry.” &lt;br data-node-id="9.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="immune-system-overload" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Immune System Overload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Before diving into the ins and outs of the new treatments, it’s helpful to understand exactly how alopecia areata impacts the body and your hair. At its most basic, this condition occurs when the immune system attacks the hair follicles—like an army mistakenly firing on its own troops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“That attack doesn’t lead to the death of hair follicles, but it puts them in a dysfunctional state, so they don’t grow hair,” says Brett King, MD, PhD, a dermatologist at Dermatology Physicians of Connecticut, whose research has played a key role in bringing JAK inhibitors for alopecia areata to the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Although its cause is unknown, experts know that alopecia areata has a genetic component. “There’s some sort of environmental input that flips the switch and turns the disease on at a specific time in an individual’s life,” says Amy McMichael, MD, a professor in the department of dermatology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. “But we don’t really know what that switch is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With alopecia, everyone’s hair loss pattern looks different. Some people develop circular bald patches, while others lose all the hair on their heads but have it elsewhere. Others grow no hair at all and resort to penciling in eyebrows and wearing fake lashes. Hair growth can wax and wane over the years, frustrating patients and their doctors who don’t know why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“One of the unique things about this condition is you can go into remission at any time,” says Deeann Graham, 53, an alopecia advocate and educator, author of &lt;a href="https://www.alopecialife.com/products-shop/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alopecialife.com/products-shop/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Head-On, Stories of Alopecia" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Head-On, Stories of Alopecia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and host of the podcast &lt;a href="https://www.alopecialife.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alopecialife.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alopecia Life" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0.0"&gt;Alopecia Life&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Graham was diagnosed at 7, had regrowth at 14, and then lost almost all of her hair between 28 and 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“When I was diagnosed, they said the most predictable thing about it is its unpredictability,” says Caitlin Riley-Klepac, 37, a mental health therapist in Lansing, Michigan, who, with the loss of hair on the sides and back of her head, likes to say she could pass for a punk rocker. She lost much of the hair on her body (one armpit would grow hair; the other wouldn’t) and has tattooed eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="17" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman with alopecia" title="woman with alopecia" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-1n1zmne e1fodxfw1"&gt;Deeann Graham, 53, is an alopecia advocate and educator, author of Head-On, Stories of Alopecia and host of the podcast Alopecia Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Women are more likely to develop the condition, which typically starts in childhood. It’s also more common in Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations, says Dr. McMichael.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alopecia areata patients also often have other autoimmune disorders. About three in 10 people with alopecia areata have autoimmune thyroid disease, and the same ratio stands with rates of eczema, says Dr. King. It’s not uncommon to also see patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="shaking-the-stigma" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Shaking the Stigma &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the roughly 700,000 Americans who suffer from alopecia areata, the social and emotional consequences and stigma of a bald or patchy scalp are tough to contend with, which makes effective treatments like Litfulo revolutionary. In fact, the mental impact of the condition is on par with developing post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Dr. King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Stigma can run deep within society’s psyche. For starters, humans seem hardwired to think something is “wrong” with a person missing hair—perhaps because it can be a sign of illness or aging. Case in point: When people in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2777018" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2777018" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are shown photos of alopecia patients who still have eyebrows and scalp hair, they say that the patients look like normal people, according to Dr. McMichael. But when the scalp hair and eyebrows are removed, they say the person looks ill. “The patients are assumed to have some sort of really severe disease,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And this just increases the stigma people with alopecia feel. Lara Ziobro, a 45-year-old working in marketing and communications from New Jersey, was diagnosed in early 2024, and noticed that having no hair “makes it seem like you’re not taking care of yourself, like there’s something wrong with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This shame and stigma can make people with alopecia hold back, avoiding activities that might expose them to humiliation—like going to a swimming pool or dating. Riley-Klepac kept her diagnosis from her closest friends and used to hide when anyone stopped by her home and she wasn’t wearing a wig. Since Graham was diagnosed while still in grade school, she remembers being teased in school and classmates pulling off her wig. When she first met her husband, she had only a few bald spots. And it took her a few weeks to build up her courage before sharing her diagnosis. “Thinking about telling him was pretty consuming,” she says. But she knew she’d have to break the news eventually, because you can’t hide alopecia. &lt;br data-node-id="25.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hair is also often part of self-expression. And Ziobro felt like she was losing a part of her identity after she started losing her hair. “I was always so proud of my hair. It was one of my trademarks,” she says. Where she used to switch up her hair—dyeing it red or blonde, going from long to short—she now switches her part from side to side or arranges her remaining hair to disguise bald spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="27" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="large" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-large embed css-1p5z8fr e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="hairbrush with hair strands entangled on bristles" title="hairbrush with hair strands entangled on bristles" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=980:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=2048:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=2048:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1gccgwy e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="jak-to-the-rescue" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;JAK to the Rescue&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So far, three JAK inhibitors have been approved for severe alopecia areata by the FDA. Olumiant (baricitinib) was approved in 2022 for adults, Litfulo (ritlecitinib) in 2023 for adults and adolescents age 12 and over, and Leqselvi (deuruxolitinib) in 2024 for adults. These treatments work by blocking Janus kinase enzymes, which play a role in a key immune system-signaling pathway that results in inflammation. By targeting these enzymes, the medication helps repress inflammatory responses in hair follicles, keeping them healthy. The first JAK inhibitors were designed to treat other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (another autoimmune condition), and have also shown promise for some skin diseases including eczema and vitiligo. Other JAK inhibitors for alopecia areata are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About half of people taking the approved new wonder drugs see significant hair growth, which is a high bar for any medication. “It’s really quite extraordinary,” says Dr. King. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But some patients see less-than-stellar results—or no results at all. Naomie Schreuder, 24, who lives in the Netherlands and participated in a clinical drug trial in Germany, gave up after a year and a half on a JAK inhibitor when she didn’t grow back any hair. “I was very hopeful,” she says. “I saw a lot of people who had great success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While there are exceptions, the drugs generally appear to be less effective in people who’ve had the disease for longer. (Schreuder has had alopecia areata for 21 years.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sandra Kelberlau, 51, an art conservator in Raleigh, North Carolina, has had moderate hair growth with Olumiant. But she’s noticed that if she has a virus or needs to take antibiotics, it triggers a flare of hair shedding. Missing doses can also cause problems, according to Amelia Anderson, 32, a web designer in Meridian, Idaho. When her prescription refill was briefly delayed four months into starting the medication, she began losing hair within a few days.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Currently, JAK inhibitors are only approved for people who have severe alopecia areata—those with 50 percent or more hair loss. Many people using the drugs have tried other treatment options in the past that didn’t work. Corticosteroids, either taken orally or injected directly into bald spots on the scalp, are a mainstay of treatment and help calm inflammation linked to the disease. But unlike JAK inhibitors, they are effective only at the injection sites, and are not systemic treatments. Steroid treatments are still used by patients with mild to moderate hair loss and an important option, Dr. McMichael says. And doctors may also use steroids at the same time as JAK inhibitors to help promote more hair growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Ziobro’s disease falls in the mild-to-moderate category. So, her dermatologist injected a steroid into bald areas as they appeared on her scalp, about once a month, which she says made it feel like they were playing whack-a-mole. (She is not currently doing injections since her bald spots have minimized but would resume if needed). Her head would hurt after the shots, and she’s experienced itching and redness, but, so far, the treatment has kept her bald spots to a minimum by helping her hair grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Topical and oral minoxidil (the active ingredient in Rogaine) can also help keep the hair follicle in the growth phase, allowing hair to increase in diameter and density, and is sometimes used in tandem with the new JAK inhibitors, says Dr. McMichael. And the immunosuppressant drug methotrexate can help treat alopecia areata by helping treat the inflammation that causes hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But so far, JAK inhibitors are the most promising long-term treatment doctors have seen for full hair regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="39" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;Hair Loss And Alopecia Areata From WH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="unwanted-effects" data-node-id="40" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;Unwanted Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The side effects of these revolutionary medications can be a challenge, particularly in the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Early on, Anderson felt mild nausea and fatigue and also experienced mood swings and occasional headaches, but the effects gradually diminished as her body adjusted to the medication. The drugs also confer a greater risk for common infections such as colds and UTIs. They can also raise cholesterol levels, which means some patients may need to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, like statins, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;More concerning, the FDA imposed a black box warning on certain medications based on initial trials that used JAK inhibitors for conditions other than alopecia areata. Despite the fact that trials for JAK inhibitor Xeljanz—which is approved for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis (among others)—had older, sicker subjects who were also taking another drug at the same time, results did show an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death. However, the American Academy of Dermatology says not all of these side effects occurred in all safety studies for different JAK inhibitors approved for alopecia areata. However, when a side effect was found in one type of JAK inhibitor, the FDA required it also be listed as a potential risk on the others that function similarly. Still, people with a history of cancer, blood clots, heart attack, stroke, or serious infection should have a conversation with their doctor about their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, not everyone who has alopecia areata can take the medications, and some people with the condition choose not to—or can’t afford it. These drugs can cost $20,000 to $30,000 a year, says Dr. Kopelman. “And with this condition you have to be on them forever.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is especially an issue for medically underserved minorities, often people of color, who may have trouble accessing any kind of health care, Dr. McMichael says. Private insurance may or may not cover the cost, and coverage through Medicaid varies from state to state. Pharma companies, however, have put in place several patient programs to try to make this treatment more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-complex-choice" data-node-id="47" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="47.0"&gt;A Complex Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="48" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After decades of coming to terms with their hair loss, people with alopecia areata have mixed feelings about the new medications. Many feel that alopecia has become part of their identity and don’t necessarily feel the need to “fix” themselves to meet social expectations of what they “should” look like. They’ve also found strength in forming supportive communities with one another. Of course, no one would question a person’s right to pursue a powerful, effective treatment for a life-altering disease. But at the same time, Riley-Klepac, Graham, and others in the hair loss community are determined that people with alopecia be comfortable with themselves, whether or not they decide to use the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some, like Graham—in league with actress Jada Pinkett Smith and bluegrass musician Molly Tuttle—are happy rocking their bald looks. “It took me years to go bald publicly,” Graham says. “Now there’s no other way for me to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Riley-Klepac, who started taking Olumiant at the end of last year, excitement about the possibility of growing hair is mixed with guilt. “I sometimes feel like I am cheating on my community,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="51" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In the summer before her senior year in high school in 2005, she attended a National Alopecia Areata Foundation conference in Tampa. “The sea of bald heads blew my mind,” she says. “At the end of the week, I felt so free without my wig, I got a second-degree sunburn on my head at the swimming pool. Meeting people like me gave me my life back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When Riley-Klepac returned to school, she finally shared her diagnosis with her principal and classmates, first in a public letter, then during an assembly, to great applause. “I got an overwhelmingly positive response,” she says.

data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen years ago, Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, set out on a personal and scientific mission. At the age of 53, he wasn’t just interested in treating disease anymore. Instead, he wanted to understand why some people seem to age effortlessly, staying active and sharp even into their 80s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;He believed the secret might lie in their genes. But what he discovered over the next decade and a half turned that idea on its head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The myth of genetic magic: Why DNA wasn’t the answer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with The Washington Post, Topol and his team spent more than six years decoding the DNA of 1,400 people aged 80 and above, all of whom had no major chronic diseases. These were the “super agers,” people who had seemingly defied time. But to his surprise, their genetic profiles didn’t have much in common. The expected pattern, the so-called “ageing gene” was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if it wasn’t genetics, what made these individuals defy ageing? This question became the foundation for his new book, which describes hundreds of studies on ageing and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Not a miracle drug or an expensive therapy, but consistent physical movement. Among all lifestyle changes, exercise was the only intervention proven to slow down the biological ageing process across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just about looking younger. The science showed that regular physical activity could literally adjust the pace at which the body ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength over speed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Topol had focused on cardio, like walking, cycling, and swimming. But while writing his book, he stumbled across mountains of evidence about strength training. It changed his perspective and his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began resistance training in his 60s and quickly became stronger than he’d ever been. It wasn’t just muscle — his balance improved, posture got better, and there was a new sense of physical confidence. All from simple tools: dumbbells, resistance bands, and bodyweight movements like planks and lunges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stood out was grip strength — a simple marker — which had a strong link to long-term health and survival. A firm handshake, it turns out, might be more than just polite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The unexpected benefits of moving with purpose&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol’s approach wasn’t about spending hours at the gym. He trained at home, short, focused workouts a few days a week. But he added something else: balance training. Exercises like standing on one leg or reaching down while balancing helped protect against falls and supported brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the benefits of being outdoors and staying socially connected. Nature and friendships, two things taken for granted, have scientifically proven effects on emotional and physical health. When combined with movement, they become a powerful trifecta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study finds obesity drug helps teens in losing weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthspan over lifespan: Living better, not just longer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal, as Topol explains, isn’t just to live longer, it’s to stay healthy longer. A concept known as healthspan. This means living free of major diseases like cancer, heart disease, and neurodegeneration for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1402378/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that healthy habits, especially regular exercise, can add seven to ten extra years of good health. That’s nearly a full decade of life with independence, energy, and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol, now 70, doesn’t dream of immortality. He just wants to make it to his late 80s still active, sharp, and disease-free. And the science suggests that this isn’t just wishful thinking, it’s an achievable reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgJBVV95cUxPRi1Ic01NMTFlUDFYYVJlMDRQZHNJVFZjRWJDb1k5aHBhczRpUS12ZmJ0d3J0d2Nhd2dDd0RBdXhqTmZ3OXJnNk4ySWUwRjlNdE81OTB0OEo1T05ZaF9ETkJIdTQ0TjV0MkhmQnU0cUZNWTRvX3JBOXhsSnZsZVZHNHd1QmNVSFZFZ1BKYWJRMVl0UV9zWU45MGVxcHJJaE5VejBYbnNpdmV3bEw4WG56bzRVdDQzcnJpaV9KQWpRVFBEZ081NjcxaFNETFVIYW1YdG9jdzZKTFRYcFJycFhFVjNxQ3p0UE9uS2FUcE9FMkM3emJBdFpwMEdUc0ZqUmFERGxEWEFQMEh1VXFFbElVVWhSRFlGRUFsLWljdkpqUzZ0amRXNkdud3MwWlJyUVlTY1ZKWmh0c2wtMFE1QXFQQU12eTdqY0JxNVFmX2pn</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜有毒吗？互联网上的紫外线真理肯定是这么认为的。-《波士顿环球报》 | Is sunscreen toxic?

She was saying this to … somehow … get more patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I had no idea that this was a public sentiment,” she said. “It had never been discussed in medical school or any of my training.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the misconception that it’s harmful is so common that even educated people believe it, she said. “I went to play tennis yesterday, and my coach was like, ‘I’m not putting chemicals on my body.’ He’s an engineer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The skepticism has its roots in reality, if only very tangentially, said Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, whose research focuses in part on false claims connected to cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is a phenomenon we see in a lot of cancer misinformation,” he said. “There is a kernel of truth to a story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, he said: a study is done in a test tube or an animal that shows a compound found in microscopic levels in sunscreen, when exposed to ultraviolet light, could cause DNA damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That result, taken out of context, makes its way to social media, where it’s sensationalized and amplified. “By the time it gets to your social media feed, it doesn’t resemble the original piece of information,” he said. “No one goes back to the original paper and sees that it was in mice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even if sunscreen raised your risk for skin cancer — which it doesn’t, he emphasized — its well-established cancer-fighting benefits would outweigh any risk. “If you’re trying to make a choice, the choice is pretty clear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are two types of sunscreens: physical blockers, which have zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and reflect ultraviolet rays from the sun; and chemical blockers, which contain chemicals that absorb the sun’s ultraviolet rays. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

There, she noticed that the better people ate, and the more time they spent in the sun, sans sunscreen, the better their skin looked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What you put in your body is more important than what you put on your body,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over on the beach, Maria Turolska, a Dorchester grandmother watching her 18-month-old grandson, both fair-skinned, said she wouldn’t use sunscreen on herself or the little boy, even though his parents wanted her to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Asked if she thought sunscreen could cause cancer, she reflected the widespread skepticism about basically everything these days: “The companies who sell the products want you to think this, but it’s hard to know if it is good or not good.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Alas, as is too often the case, you may be doomed no matter what you do.

A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01650254241289319" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;International Journal of Behavioral Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that parents’ beliefs about social hierarchy and obedience to authority may shape the development of this socio-cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore how broader social and political attitudes held by parents might be linked to their children’s ability to understand others’ perspectives. Previous studies had already shown that children’s theory of mind can be supported by hearing language that refers to thoughts, feelings, desires, and beliefs—what is often called mental state talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, less was known about how parental attitudes toward authority and inequality might influence this kind of talk, especially when discussing people from groups perceived as different. The new study aimed to fill that gap by examining two belief systems: social dominance orientation—the belief that some groups deserve to be dominant over others—and right-wing authoritarianism, or the belief that people should submit to established authorities and social norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been interested in social sensitivity and human interactions, but I fell into the topic by virtue of knowing I wanted to work with children, and there being two professors I could work with. One, David R. Olson, was exceptionally nice and happened to be studying theory of mind. I wanted to work with him because I liked him,” said study author Ted Ruffman, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 79 mother-child pairs in New Zealand. All participants were of European ethnicity and spoke English. The children ranged in age from two to nearly six years old, with an average age of about 3.7 years. The researchers assessed the mothers’ social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism using standard psychological questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also measured the children’s language ability and their theory of mind skills using well-established tasks. These included activities like identifying when a character in a story held a false belief or had different desires from others—tasks commonly used in developmental psychology to assess children’s social understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these assessments, the mothers participated in a picture description task. Each mother was randomly assigned to view a series of images showing either European or Chinese children and asked to describe the pictures to their child “as if reading a storybook.” The photos depicted children expressing different emotions or reaching for objects, and the mothers’ descriptions were recorded and analyzed. The researchers focused on how often the mothers used mental state words like “think,” “feel,” “want,” or “hope,” and categorized them by type, such as cognition, emotion, or desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mothers who scored higher in social dominance orientation or right-wing authoritarianism used fewer mental state words when describing the Chinese children, who were considered an outgroup. However, this relationship was not seen when they described pictures of European children, who were considered part of their ingroup. This suggests that the mothers’ attitudes influenced their willingness—or perhaps their ability—to engage in perspective-taking when the target of discussion belonged to a different ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers also found a broader link between these maternal attitudes and children’s theory of mind scores. Regardless of which set of pictures the mother described, children whose mothers scored higher on social dominance orientation or right-wing authoritarianism performed worse on the theory of mind tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This held true even after accounting for the children’s age, language ability, and the mother’s education level. These results suggest that a parent’s social and political attitudes may influence a child’s social development in more general ways—not just through moment-to-moment interactions, but possibly through broader patterns in parenting and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings highlight a potentially important link between a parent’s worldview and a child’s social-cognitive development. If parents who see the world through a lens of hierarchy or strict obedience tend to talk less about thoughts and feelings—especially when discussing people from different backgrounds—children may miss out on opportunities to practice understanding others’ minds. Over time, this could hinder the development of empathy and perspective-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are things you can say to your child, talk to them about the mental states and feelings of others, that will help the child become a cooperative and insightful human being,” Ruffman told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations to consider. One is that the study was cross-sectional, meaning it cannot establish cause and effect. It’s possible—though less likely—that children with lower theory of mind somehow influence their parents’ beliefs, or that both are shaped by a third factor like shared temperament or household dynamics. Additionally, the study only included mothers of European ethnicity in New Zealand, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other cultural and demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers suggest that longitudinal studies could provide stronger evidence about the direction of the relationship between parental beliefs and children’s theory of mind. Such studies could also explore whether other factors, like parental empathy or subtle nonverbal behaviors, help explain how these beliefs are transmitted. Given that both social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism have been linked to prejudice and reduced empathy in adults, the idea that they could shape children’s ability to understand others is worth further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t fear the truth,” Ruffman added. “Infants might not actually know very much, so let’s not work so hard to show that they do. ‘Big’ journals shouldn’t have a bias to publish early-onset findings (which they clearly do).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01650254241289319" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;What she believes or what she says?

The other half were given leaflets promoting a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed after five years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;80% of people exercising remained cancer-free&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;compared with 74% in the other group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;meaning a 28% reduction in the risk of the cancer coming back, or a new one forming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Meanwhile, eight years after the initial cancer treatment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;10% of people on the exercise programme died&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;compared with 17% in the group given only health advice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;marking a 37% lower risk of death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Exactly why exercise has this beneficial effect is unknown, but ideas include the impact on growth hormones, inflammation levels in the body and how the immune system functions - which patrols the body for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Joe Henson, from the University of Leicester, said the results were "exciting".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He added: "I saw first-hand that this reduced fatigue, lifted people's mood and boosted their physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We know that physical activity regulates several key biological processes that could explain these results, and further research will help us uncover why exercise is having such a positive impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Colon cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with around 31,800 people diagnosed each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Caroline Geraghty, from Cancer Research UK, said: "This trial has the potential to transform clinical practice, but only if health services have the necessary funding and staff to make it a reality for patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:04:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBSR04xcnNaWUVyeFV1aGJOMHdHUUhoVVd5b3hrWF9aNGRKY083RXpaR1RwSy01VXQ5RVFoY0NPd3FpRXItbUFrWnRFaU1xNURKSTJZT2R1ZHJRQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5kRHNpMVIyTWU4WXFyVXdYWmNEREg3OHdxVXIwQUFUMlJKZmlfNzlTbHF6anBhVHNlN0hwbjYzMzRRVVR0THFyem1oVTFGekhWMmROWEQ5d0Z2MVJrYy1Z</guid></item><item><title>如果你能在60岁时完成这5个动作，你的身体就会年轻几十年-吃这个不是那个 | If You Can Perform These 5 Moves at 60, Your Body’s Decades Younger - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1yOWJwTlhoSVB4V3prNzVpRHBBMkVTYkdHd014NkdadVZXaXFjaHlZdXd1cGVMRDlMY2J1N3ltY3ZyZldpdFRfdVh4eWpwNnczeW5SRHJKcWUzRHdpNmZhbXZ4TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Sixty is considered middle age by today’s standards, which means you could still have plenty of vibrant years ahead. That’s why being in great physical shape should be high on your priority list. But how do you know if you are as fit and strong as you should be at 60? We took the guesswork out of the equation with five expert-approved &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-strength-workout-to-shrink-belly-fat-reduce-inflammation/" target="_blank"&gt;strength workouts&lt;/a&gt;. If you can do the below movements at 60, you’re literally decades ahead of the fitness curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we need to focus on getting as strong as possible,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-carlson-9769816/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luke Carlson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ACSM certified exercise physiologist, ACSM certified cancer exercise trainer, and founder and CEO at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.discoverstrength.com/our-team" target="_blank"&gt;Discover Strength&lt;/a&gt;, tells us. “We don’t need to be more active, become more flexible, or increase mobility, we need to get strong … There is no fountain of youth, but there is strength training.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;All muscle groups decline pretty evenly. But as we get older, there is more loss of “fast twitch” muscle fibers, which allow forceful contraction of muscles, Luke points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To counteract this, we can perform the basic strength training exercises listed above and on the final few reps, when the weight becomes very challenging, we should attempt to lift the weight fast,” he explains. “Of course, the weight won’t actually move fast because we are so fatigued. But this attempt to lift the weight fast taps into these fast twitch muscle fibers (in a very safe manner).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the five movements Luke recommends doing to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tennis-ball-grip-strength-longevity-test/" target="_blank"&gt;test your longevity and performance&lt;/a&gt; at 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not only do we increase the muscle mass and strength in this area, but we also stimulate metabolic health benefits when performing strength training exercises for large muscle groups,” Luke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do a bodyweight squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet shoulder-distance apart and arms at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descend into a bodyweight squat, maintaining a tall chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs become parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to rise up.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chest press works the chest and triceps. You can perform the chest press motion with dumbbells, a machine, or by doing a pushup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back on a workout bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand just outside your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your feet flat on the ground and maintain an engaged core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the dumbbells over your chest until your arms are extended but not locked out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do a lat pulldown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated at a lat pulldown machine, holding onto the bar with a shoulder-width overhand grip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your shoulders back and down as you pull the bar down toward your upper chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold at the bottom of the movement before slowly releasing the bar back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shoulder press will increase the strength of the triceps and shoulders. You can do this exercise using a dumbbell or machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your core tight as you stand tall with a dumbbell in each hand held at shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms are completely extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to lower the dumbbells to shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position yourself on a back extension bench with your feet locked in and hips situated just above the pad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross your arms in front of your chest or hold onto a dumbbell for extra resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your upper body toward the ground while maintaining a neutral spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your torso until your body becomes straight from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause at the top of the movement before lowering with control.&lt;/li&gt;

By Oct. 31, when she was 33 weeks pregnant, she felt something was off and was very unwell. She called an ambulance and went to the Staten Island University Hospital. That’s when she was told that she had preeclampsia and was showing severe symptoms of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4UBLIWET75FJ7J4VQSVNRD6U4E"&gt;“They told me that if I didn‘t come in [that] I probably would have lost my life at any given moment because my blood pressure was so high,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7L74EKBONESFEI5DIOB4AU76I"&gt;Preeclampsia is diagnosed if someone has persistent high blood pressure, protein in their urine, or other signs of organ damage and typically begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had previously been in the standard range, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="75JSUOYLWZEGPGQCHJMPCVGLC4"&gt;“I‘m very in tune with my body... I know when something feels wrong,” she said, explaining that she was told everything was normal during her check-ups. “My preeclampsia went unknown my entire pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HFC5WS6IQJECVOKTMPDJKLHXTQ"&gt;Looking back, Gonzalez said she began noticing symptoms at week 25. It wasn’t until week 33 of her pregnancy, when she was in the hospital, that preeclampsia was detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6J4MVUWRRND6BC5I4S3AQIPUA4"&gt;She noticed her urine was orange, despite drinking plenty of water. She was also extremely swollen and experienced severe blurred vision, which was unusual for her since she’d always had perfect vision. She also had constant headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YNRP4REQGJE2VOIFLA22DY7M5Q"&gt;Gonzalez noted that what she was experiencing can sometimes seem like “normal pregnancy symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RRDTBPSA25DY5GE7HZXXUBGAJA"&gt;“But it wasn’t,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KW6T2EM6WBBSPO7M5WE6D77JJU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17952-preeclampsia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17952-preeclampsia"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, early signs of preeclampsia include high blood pressure, protein in urine, and water retention (causing swelling and weight gain). Other symptoms are headaches, blurry vision, light sensitivity, dark spots, upper right abdominal pain, swelling in hands/ankles/face, and shortness of breath. Severe preeclampsia may cause a person to produce little or no urine, develop fluid in the lungs, and experience decreased kidney or liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7F4AQ7KK2NESBN2VBN7RD4YHVQ"&gt;While the exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown, several factors can increase your risk during pregnancy. These include carrying twins, triplets, or more; being pregnant for the first time; being over age 35; having a family history of preeclampsia; and having conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders like lupus, or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FYR2Q37YLRDGXJAMZOPXVL4PO4"&gt;Gonzalez shared that she has had normal blood pressure during physical check-ups her entire life and no health conditions that would indicate a risk for preeclampsia. However, she discovered that her mother also had preeclampsia when giving birth to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J66BLDTBTVG2TAMRMHWBPW3IFE"&gt;“My mom also had preeclampsia when she was pregnant with me and she actually flatlined and they had to resuscitate her. She made it out and she’s perfectly healthy now,” Gonzalez, who is the second born of five sisters, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="THWNUSEORJDSTK6VNGCINQRMBM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/about/high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy.html#:~:text=Get%20early%20and%20regular%20prenatal,910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/about/high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy.html#:~:text=Get%20early%20and%20regular%20prenatal,910"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related death, affecting approximately 2% to 8% of all pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;In critical condition: ‘I was just worried about losing my life’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XOND6CGQ2JD3HDTN4FNOM5BVA4"&gt;Upon arriving to the Staten Island University Hospital, the doctors started Gonzalez on multiple medications to regulate her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZJNNEXR3YJC3DF5E2OK476JDKU"&gt;She was given magnesium sulfate, an anticonvulsant used to prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia, as it helps prevent brain swelling by protecting the blood-brain barrier. She was also given antihypertensive drugs to lower her blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XKDSGMB66FBZHPOSJUEBPZEZLI"&gt;“When I got there, I was honestly very scared,” she said. “I am so young, so I was just worried about losing my life and not having a chance of being there for my baby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2FS3TUMWM5GPLLSVCPDENLIZXA"&gt;She shared that the nurses allowed her entire family to go and see her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AIM2GK54GRHQZCDPTTB4S3VBFA"&gt;“They all just kind of prayed over me and wished for the best,” she said. “My mom was with me literally every step of the way. She was definitely my strength through this whole thing. She guided me through it very well and she stayed strong for me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="25LZTBREE5HCPJ2GAOA6ABAF3U"&gt;Gonzalez recalled being at the hospital for two days, progressively getting worse. At 33 weeks pregnant, she was initially supposed to stay until 37 weeks, but her condition worsened, prompting doctors to deliver her baby immediately. On Nov. 2, 2024, she was induced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YKRS5ECNLNENBK3ZJABH6TN7G4"&gt;“They had to induce me at 33 weeks to have my baby and they basically told me it could end badly or go great. The chances of me losing my life were very high, especially considering that I was having a natural birth and not a c-section,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Motherhood: ‘I just enjoy bonding with her’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PA5ZDGWCY5CS3EHJYH4CNLEFTY"&gt;Gonzalez’s new born baby, Nova Gonzalez, was born seven weeks premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZI2Z5IBMMNG37BMB7EMK5MCAUU"&gt;“The first three weeks of her life, she spent in the NICU, so I wasn‘t able to bond with her,” Gonzalez said. “It’s been hard of course, but I just enjoy bonding with her now and watching her grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4DOPHY6NMNHNVM7EGDBZ65X654"&gt;Today, at six months, Nova is a very healthy baby and hitting all her milestones, her mother shared, despite being told by doctors that she might not reach them for some time.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — mRNA, a Nobel-winning technology harnessed by Trump officials to create Covid shots in record time, is becoming a political reject as the nation’s leaders openly embrace vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers and federal health officials alike are shunning messenger RNA, a basic building block of biology that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;proved its value during Covid&lt;/a&gt;, and that holds promise for combating the next pandemic and unlocking new cancer treatments. Public health experts and biotech companies are watching in horror as the government cuts its investments in the technology, and as officials like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. foment deep distrust of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed it was canceling &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;more than $700 million worth of contracts&lt;/a&gt; with Moderna to develop, test, and license mRNA vaccines for flu strains that could cause future pandemics, including the H5N1 bird flu virus. &lt;/p&gt;

Yes. Tummy rolls? Tick. But the wedge-shaped piece of us that's called the 'silent organ' doesn't usually get a look-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's hardly a surprise. The liver doesn't have any pain receptors so it goes under the radar for most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But your liver is also your body's hardest-working organ. It's busy, making up about two per cent of an average human's body weight and holding 13 per cent of your blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the place in your body where everything is processed - and plays a central role in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-0726c640-3c2a-11f0-8afb-cb6fe68711e0"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, digestion, immunity, blood sugar control, hormone regulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical nutritionist Sarah Di Lorenzo, author of The Liver Repair Plan, says the liver is 'critical for our good overall health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If your liver is not well, then your entire body will know about it,' she says. 'When your liver health is poor, it's a roadblock to reaching your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Think about weight loss – your liver is involved in your metabolism, so if it's not working properly then your metabolism is impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'When people improve their liver health, the weight starts falling off, while their skin, energy, mood, libido, stress and sleep improves,' says Sarah di Lorenzo, author of The Liver Repair Plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When people improve their liver health, the weight starts falling off, while their skin, energy, mood, libido, stress and sleep improves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your liver's in trouble, you might not even realise it until it's damaged and inflamed - which is why Di Lorenzo says it's important to look out for the subtle signs, and there are some you might find surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your liver has damage, it doesn't produce enough clotting proteins so you may bruise easily,' Di Lorenzo explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is also a sign of progressive liver damage and can be from any type of liver disorder.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constant headaches are 'a common sign of liver dysfunction' to look out for, adds Di Lorenzo. They can be caused when the liver is compromised and can't filter toxins from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark circles under your eyes are also a 'telltale sign' of impaired liver function. 'When the liver can't clear waste, it's deposited in the vessels under the eyes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Struggling to lose weight is a big one that Di Lorenzo has encountered all too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver is one of many roadblocks for people struggling to lose weight,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In his 60s, David's liver was under strain. By following Sarah's plan, he reduced his biological age by 20 years - and his doctor was astounded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When our liver is burdened, it can't function properly, which impacts how it metabolises nutrients and fat, slowing down our metabolism and leading to weight gain. In a compromised liver, toxins can build up and hormonal imbalances can occur, leading to really stubborn weight gain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of particular concern is excess weight around the midsection, which suggests there is fat between the organs of the abdominal cavity rather than subcutaneous fat, which is fat under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're suffering from bloating and a pot belly, Di Lorenzo says you could be suffering from a condition called ascites, where the liver malfunction leads to a build-up of fluid - this is when liver disease is very advanced and linked to liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a tongue with a white coating on it can also indicate liver problems, as can itchy spots on your arms, legs and soles of the feet, which are a surprising sign that something's amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, our energy levels are also linked to the liver, so if you're feeling unusually fatigued it could be a sign to go to your doctor to get your liver checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do have some of the above symptoms, the good news is that the liver has the greatest regenerative capacity of any organ in the body. Even after 90 per cent of it has been removed, it can regrow to a normal size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That doesn't mean it's invincible - many diseases can destroy it beyond repair - but there are things you can do right now to support its regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One thing to do is - with guidance from your doctor - look at what supplements and pain relief medications you're taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While herbs and supplements may seem harmless because many can be purchased over the counter, some can be toxic to our liver,' Di Lorenzo explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people are genuinely surprised when I share this information – they wonder how something "natural" could be toxic to the liver – but it's true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people take over-the-counter supplements because they think they're being healthy, but you should only take what you really need. Ideally, use practitioner-only ranges that are clean and effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the herbs and supplements to 'be careful of', according to the expert, are aloe vera, bodybuilding supplements, green tea extract, traditional Chinese medicines and weight-loss supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Di Lorenzo says pain relief medications should only be taken 'when you really do need them'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know many people who take them for the mildest of symptoms. Pain-relief medications like paracetamol and NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) can damage the liver,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the developed world, paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure. Ibuprofen is linked to liver damage because it can increase the liver enzyme ALT (alanine aminotransferase), meaning liver cells are damaged or have died.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other simple ways to support liver regeneration are to reduce your alcohol consumption and stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Di Lorenzo's rule of thumb is to drink 30ml of water for each kilo of body weight per day; get regular check-ups with your doctor; aim to get to a healthy weight and stay at it; and eat a healthy and balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But what foods are key to achieving the best result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sarah Di Lorenzo's book, The Liver Repair Plan, published by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster is out now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Di Lorenzo advises looking for antioxidant-rich foods that are full of fibre, good fats and polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee, coriander, cruciferous vegetables, tea, grapes, blueberries, seeds and nuts all get the tick of approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best foods for our liver are those that support comprehensive liver function and detox pathways. While all healthy, real, whole foods support our health, some key foods have a bigger impact so should have starring roles in our diet,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Embracing herbs and spices in your diet is a good way to add to the taste without amping up the salt, with Di Lorenzo saying they are 'amazing at accelerating the nutritional profile of your meals'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fibre-rich foods are also important for keeping your bowel functioning, avoiding constipation and keeping cholesterol low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, fibre protects the liver from inflammation,' says Di Lorenzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Think of eating a rainbow of fruit and vegetables, high-fibre whole grains, good fats, lean proteins, nuts and seeds, legumes, and calcium-rich dairy foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;David's story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney man David O' Toole began working with Sarah Di Lorenzo in November 2023 after tests showed his liver was under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After just four weeks of following Di Lorenzo's recipes, cutting out alcohol and incorporating Pilates into his routine, he saw his liver function return 'to textbook levels', something he and his doctor 'could hardly believe'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, in my mid-60s, I feel decades younger, with recent tests confirming that my biological age is in the 40s,' explains David, who calls his experience 'life-changing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was determined not to follow the path that so many my age take - frequent doctor visits and a growing list of ailments,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is clear to me that our medical system is struggling under the weight of preventable health issues, and I am so grateful to have found a path that allows me to take full responsibility for my health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Sarah Di Lorenzo's book, The Liver Repair Plan, published by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster is out now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Foods that fall under the category include red and processed meats, sugary drinks, refined grains like white pasta or bread and even tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pizza was classed as anti-inflammatory as it contains cooked tomatoes, which are high in the powerful antioxidant, lycopene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study found colon cancer patients who ate more inflammatory food than 80 per cent of the volunteers had a 36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who ate very little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts, presenting the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-1ae2bf90-1f2a-11ef-bfef-172cb460e31a" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, said that, while there is not yet enough evidence to support the anti-inflammatory diet as a recommendation for cancer patients, this may be the case in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the study, scientists tracked 1,625 patients with colon cancer that had spread to the nearby lymph glands, but not beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All volunteers completed food questionnaires about how often they consumed foods that fell under 18 food groups—nine pro-inflammatory and nine anti-inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of three years researchers found that patients in the top 20 per cent of most inflammatory diets had a &lt;span&gt;36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who consumed least. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those in the top 20 per cent also had an 87 per cent higher risk of death overall than the bottom 20 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When exercise was taken into account, those who consumed the least inflammatory diet and maintained the highest levels of physical activity had a 63 per cent lower risk of death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients — which are usually not eaten alone — include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASCO president and top cancer specialist Julie Gralow said the findings suggested 'we need to be essentially prescribing healthy diet and exercise. The combination of the two are synergistic.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catherine Elliott, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-04a73a20-3f05-11f0-849f-612e04caad7d"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK's director of research, also told MailOnline: 'This study adds to interesting emerging evidence about the role of inflammation in the progression of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need more high-quality research like this to help us uncover more about how our diet influences cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'When it comes to food and cancer risk, our overall diet is far more important than any single food or ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A healthy, balanced diet includes eating lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and healthy sources of protein like beans and chicken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cutting down on processed and red meats, and foods high in fat, sugar and salt also helps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as other research presented at ASCO found colon cancer patients who stuck to an anti-inflammatory diet reduced their risk of the disease spreading or recurring by 38 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by scientists at Maimonides Medical Centre in New York, tracked the food habits of 796 patients who had been diagnosed with the disease between 2015 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found consuming a diet high in ultra-processed foods raised the odds almost two and a half times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods increase inflammation and colon cancer risk while anti-inflammatory diets offer protective benefits,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary intervention must play a role in preventing cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer, long considered a disease of old age, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14631623/doctor-five-signs-colon-cancer-rise-Gen-Z-Millennials.html"&gt;increasingly striking people in their 20s, 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; in a phenomenon that has baffled doctors around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last 30 years, young diagnoses of the disease have shot up by 80 per cent across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 32,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 142,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:59:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOQ0xadnpUbDUzbmpwQy12bU5rSlZQYXdPTWNOVjBYRXRFRkJKQk5rSEh5VzJ1Z2hGT0pUeW9wcVNzcmg3ckhsS3kxUHd5QVBkdktHYkhvSDQ5cURqT19tT3JHWWpVZF9TdVJ3R185TnFJTXJiOEU5eExIVDByV2V0LWh2c2JSOE9sLXRPZjhLZXVlNHNrNHBra1lpWDZibk52dUhUVUF3OGrSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUU0NDBZb1R4U0FXdGFwLXlGUkxsdWliRW5kNC1tOEF3M1d3M2RINHhIWUZ4MmNjaUE0cTViZmdmVGo2SzFIeGN3NHp0b1BPUE1MZWVxOXZNV3FtcXhSbTVUZG01cEs4djBQdldwMDJTOElDRDdwMGYtRmNBUkFlQlg3TUdvOTEySW9OSkYyOXZmMzJZQnNhdzNhVE96WlhEa2Y5RW9RMlZyM29FZl93</guid></item><item><title>日本科学家开发出兼容所有血型的人造血-东京周末 | Japanese Scientists Develop Artificial Blood Compatible With All Blood Types - Tokyo Weekender</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPUG1lNnB5TmNYdlM2SWU3bHk5Qm1xVnhMODFyaVNSTkJobTk4SmVzYmVfMDZNMDExdVJUYUFfSFlhR1RhZ0ttMlBnQW5YcHdJbGJ0YTBFRmhVMVdjOUI3ZHFPZ2Y0NWo2czRTYjk5OXZ4SDhnSVRRNUNNT2Q0bWlQcEJabnV0NFJ3bVE2U1pPRDlFdmhNU1lXdkZ6V0Y4cWlmc19fNg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-template-standard"&gt;

Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;negative blood — the universal donor type — often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at &lt;a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nara Medical University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;They’ve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt; developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW34223700 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;reportedly be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt; stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;42 days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW166998970 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles — artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells — in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt;If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt;ing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt; the treatment’s efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW144022034 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What is your morning routine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get up around 4.30am, waking naturally. I measure my body temperature through my ear and then do three minutes of 10,000 Lux light, because I wake up before the sun. That sets my &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sleep/best-time-to-go-to-bed/"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and mood. I do a pre-workout food mix, work out for an hour, then sauna for 20 minutes, and I’ll wear a red-light therapy cap for six minutes for hair growth. I’ll then do hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a pressurised chamber. Then breakfast. And then I’m ready for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How many supplements do you take?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 40: basic things such as vitamin D, E, glycerin, magnesium, as well as some advanced things like creatine and calcium alpha-ketoglutarate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How much water do you drink a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment I’m doing a “sauna protocol”: 20 minutes every day at 200F [93C]. In that session I sweat 18oz, with 34 milligrams of sodium per ounce. So I consume around 96 ounces [2.8 litres] of liquid per day that I put potassium, magnesium and salt in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Why do you lead a vegan diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow the evidence, you can arrive at the place where you see that a plant-based diet produces some of the best outcomes for longevity. The only non-plant-based thing I do are collagen peptides supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What is your typical daily diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consume 2,250 calories a day, which is about 10 per cent caloric restriction. That includes 130g of protein, 206g of carbs, 101g of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find my protein in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/best-beans-for-your-health/"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt; (lentils, edamame, chickpeas), pea and hemp protein, and from collagen peptides. There are also small amounts in things such as cauliflower and broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also consume a lot of olive oil. I put it in my protein shakes and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What do you do before bed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My bedtime is 8.30pm. So I typically work until about 7.30pm, and then I have an hour wind-down routine. I turn the screens off, I’ll read a book, wash my face and teeth and hang out with my family. It’s meant to be time that transitions you from work mode to relax mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to eat your final meal of the day at least four hours before bed. And exercise in the evening is bad for you. I also journal, so that when my head hits the pillow I’m not thinking about my day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What’s the most important step in your longevity routine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All bad habits make your heart rate increase. And all the good habits make it decrease. So the goal is to lower your heart rate to 55 and then 50 before bed. If you have a low resting heart rate, you get a good night’s sleep. You can check your heart rate if you have a wearable [device]. Lie down on your pillow, take a few breaths and calm yourself down, and then look at your heart rate. If it’s 60 beats per minute, your goal in life now is to lower it to 55 and then to 50.&lt;/p&gt;

Although it's most popularly linked with the smell of flatulence, H₂S is also formed by human cells in minute quantities. Researchers have found over the recent years that the gas functions as an intercellular communication molecule in the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrates that hydrogen sulfide causes arteries to dilate, letting blood circulate more freely and reducing the pressure on artery walls. The action, called vasodilation, plays an important role in the maintenance of normal blood pressure and protection against complications of hypertension like stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The process:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enzyme responsible for producing hydrogen sulfide in the body causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, an important determinant of blood pressure and vascular resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory exposure to designed experiments in animals has been reported to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive models with a robust biological rationale for its mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what does that mean for us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the notion of gas being beneficial to one's health is humorous, but the takeaway here is larger: cardiovascular health directly relates to the gut microbiome and its byproducts. A balance of gut flora achieved through a high-fiber diet, prebiotics, and probiotics can result in the production of such natural compounds as hydrogen sulfide, which in turn may maintain cardiac function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be stated that the study is not recommending unregulated flatulence or extreme changes in diet over medical recommendations. Furthermore, the direct correlation of gas release and blood pressure in human beings is also under research. Nevertheless, what the study does point out is the interconnection between the cardiovascular system and the digestive system, which goes further to show the significance of gut health in overall wellness programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it may be the courteous thing to do, not passing gas is actually creating some undesirable side effects on your circulatory system, according to the new science. More generally, this research contributes to the vast evidence that what goes on in the gut does not stay in the gut; it influences the whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our knowledge of the microbiome expands, so does our understanding of the subtle, intricate mechanisms our bodies use to maintain equilibrium, sometimes in the strangest ways.

Despite its importance, about 20% of people over the age of 60 in the United States and the United Kingdom are deficient in the vitamin. Here are some crucial signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 that one should not ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is vitamin B12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin crucial for several bodily functions.

Cardiovascular diseases account for 17.9 million deaths worldwide in 2023. Diet plays a crucial role in heart health and in reducing the risk of heart disease. A recent study examined the relationship between heart disease and diet and has identified one that benefits the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the quality of the food matters more than cutting carbs or fat. The findings will be presented at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition2025.eventscribe.net/index.asp?presTarget=3036520" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, which will be held in Orlando this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quality over quantity&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that when it comes to protecting the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/health/how-silent-heart-attacks-are-killing-seemingly-fit-indians/articleshow/121410648.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the types of foods one eats may be more important than whether they follow a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. To understand what works in favour of the heart, the researchers followed almost 200,000 people for several decades, and observed that the quality of food consumed matters as much as following a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. The findings suggested that choosing healthy, high-quality foods is key to protecting the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets have been endorsed by health experts for their potential health benefits, such as weight management and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of these diets on reducing heart disease risk has remained an ongoing debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that what you eat on low-carb or low-fat diets matters just as much as the diet itself. Healthy versions of these diets—those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains—were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease,” said Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Qi Sun, MD, ScD, at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the link, the researchers analyzed data from three large cohorts: 43,430 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986–2016), 64,164 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (1986–2018), and 92,189 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991–2019). The scientists followed these nearly 200,000 participants for several decades, tracking their dietary habits and whether they developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed detailed food frequency questionnaires over time, allowing researchers to score their diets based on the quality of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified carbohydrates, fat,s and proteins from foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nut,s and legumes as high-quality nutrients, or healthy, while carbohydrates from potatoes and refined grains, as well as saturated fats and proteins from animal-based foods, were categorized as low-quality, or unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 participants, the team also examined blood metabolites to understand how diet quality influenced metabolic health. “This approach allowed us to better understand the biological effects of these diets and strengthened our findings,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take away&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants who followed a healthy low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet had a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, while those on unhealthy versions saw an increased risk. These healthy diet patterns, whether a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, lowered the risk of developing heart disease by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;You Clean Your Diet, But What About Your Company? Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati's Powerful Truth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that improving food quality is crucial for improving heart health. Regardless of whether someone follows a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, emphasizing whole, minimally processed and plant-based foods and limiting refined grain, sugar, and animal foods, can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease,” Wu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What to do &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep heart diseases at bay, the researchers suggest incorporating more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes while cutting back on processed meats, refined carbs and sugary foods. Pro tip? Check food labels and be mindful of added low-quality ingredients, such as added sugars in juices and processed snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQQmRZZVk0R05wSUNleGR6U1lqNmttMlNRckxzem9TNjF0aENwS05XNWtEbGZuRXRsZkVCbkhGbndJNGpPVVdta25ZQUgxYjJvQVpicHF0ZzJrNnFtaUhDZGZxWFgtWjEzSUlFbDZBclNjY3locXVrZWtzMlVZdTQtU2VKV3VrZnhPUXlOV05HWHdhZWh4TnEtODEtTXBKMU5wa251dXkzZWtOZGJ4WGZhblNkRlNvTlN2ekVnYS1ySk5DbENwcUNxN1JWLURUenJraVRjN19QS1JKV0gydUtpSWNVM242a2ljMDlQdWlLNWc</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多斯普林斯确诊麻疹，公众要求留意症状- KKTV | Measles confirmed in Colorado Springs, public asked to watch for symptoms - KKTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOTllSeXpSSmk5VTU5QTFCN3BuNTNVa0ZoWjBxZ2FIQ09ncDN2UFowTmx4LU01SS1nTjJYRUljVlR2RDQ1QjZGOWVnb0JqWDNVblVPU2VudUVqVnJEdG1wUzRpMDA3Y1lvalM5RS1wWHh4cFFxU1RBUHZ3cHM3cGlrdkpNRkJUN0VjbTRGMHBaV0FpNGtPMWQyekVMWdIBrwFBVV95cUxPal9wWFc5T1YwVlVqRVBWNjhzbnp4VUMxYnlVaEFqNFRaNDlDMW1CM2gwVlprT1pwb182NFRFX1NMY1lqdDRYeXNEYlhUc2RmeTdWUzZlbHljZ0g0em96Y1pEZ2EtdjV4S2NMeHpjVjFacGhIRnhDRDd3YUhyV3o0T1pGcTRxSkJwLVJvbW5TUGZScGpHREpuMC1qaEpUekd2RHgzWVU1d0h1YUpqSThr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s okay to mix and match meals. You could repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17899/health-condition/diabetic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. If you’re making a swap, it’s helpful to know that we did create this meal plan with certain parameters in mind. We aimed for 1,800 calories a day, about 40 grams of carbohydrates per meal and at least 100 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber per day. If you’re selecting a recipe not in this plan, it may be helpful to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely. Each breakfast and lunch is about 400 calories and has 40 grams of carbs, so choosing one option to eat daily would work for this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for how many carbs a person should eat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Appetite, body size and activity level can all influence how many carbohydrates you should eat and their impact on blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For more individualized guidance, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_185-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because high blood sugar can increase muscle loss, getting your levels within normal range is the first step to help build muscle and preserve muscle mass. In this meal plan, we incorporate several nutritional strategies to help improve blood sugar levels. When it comes to building muscle, nutrition is just one piece of the puzzle. Incorporating an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-cardio-exercise-better-than-resistance-for-diabetes-8678211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/a&gt; is another key strategy. Before you start a new physical activity routine, it may be helpful to discuss your goals with your medical provider. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_186-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_187-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Each day includes at least 106 grams of protein, spread throughout the day to maximize absorption. Research shows that eating more protein earlier in the day can lead to increased muscle growth compared to the more traditional pattern of focusing solely on a high-protein dinner.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Including protein throughout the day, especially when it’s paired with carbohydrate foods, can also promote more stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderately-Low Carbohydrate&lt;/strong&gt;: We opted for a moderately-low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-you-should-be-buying-for-insulin-resistance-8678201" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; level of about 40% of calories from carbs, which is lower than the 45 to 65% of calories from carbs recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To promote stable blood sugars and prevent spikes, we spread the carbohydrates fairly evenly across the day’s meals and snacks and opted for slowly-digested, high-fiber carbs, such as whole-grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 31 grams of fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, nuts and legumes. Because fiber isn’t broken down by the body, it doesn’t raise blood sugar levels like other carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber can also protect your heart and help you feel fuller for longer, which may lead to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

Determined to bring him home, Giorgi launched an all-out search—posting flyers, talking to neighbors, and walking the streets every day. But despite his tireless efforts, Jorge was nowhere to be found. &lt;span class="has-highlight-color"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Watch Video Below)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his efforts, days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years. The once-hopeful search faded as Giorgi faced the difficult reality—Jorge might be gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;On The Street For 3 Years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life on the streets is a constant struggle for stray and lost dogs. Unpredictable weather, scarce food and water, limited shelter, and the dangers of urban life create a harsh environment where survival is possible but fraught with risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Giorgi Bereziani, the uncertainty surrounding Jorge’s fate was a heavy burden. Three years after his dog’s disappearance, Giorgi tried to move forward, but the unanswered questions and memories of Jorge continued to weigh on his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, out of the blue, Giorgi got a call that that changed everything. Some employees at the local opera house had spotted a black and white dog wandering nearby, and thought it looked familiar. Upon closer examination, the opera house employees believed it might be a dog they had seen on missing posters throughout the city. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reunited With Dog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though it had been more than three years, Giorgi sprang into action the moment he heard someone had seen a dog that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;might&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; be Jorge.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making his way to the opera house, Giorgi kept an eye out for any sign of Jorge. He made his way around the building, waiting to see him. Then, he spotted something lying at the base of a tree on the sidewalk: a sweet black and white dog. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unbelievable Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Jorge! Is that you?” Giorgi called out, picking up speed and practically sprinting towards the dog. It was the type of moment you’d expect out of a Hallmark movie, except this was real life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immediately, the dog’s head snapped up, swiveling to look at Giorgi. It took only a second, but then, Jorge was up! He &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;obviously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;remembered his owner, Giorgi, and was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;thrilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to see him again. In the video of Jorge and Giorgi’s reunion, you can hear Jorge whimpering and crying in excitement, see him wiggling his entire body, and pushing against Giorgi for lots of pets and snuggles. It’s a powerful moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is hard to imagine spending three years away from your best friend, but we’re so glad Jorge and Giorgi are back together again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Headlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9ZR18wMWN4TlBobEVqeDBjZXl3eWFzS3Ffc1N2eFA5Y1IzdzBvQlpKMnVwbjFwa082bmJHYjQ2Y3RZb19pTUhtLVE3NmlKd2Rlbzh1elp4NGplQzdMSnFYWndsMjFpeGFuQXpjMjZZTFN6Q0U</guid></item><item><title>神经科学突破：在最近的7项研究中揭示了关于记忆的令人惊讶的事实- PsyPost | Neuroscience breakthroughs: Surprising truths about memory revealed in 7 recent studies - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOMkZ4bkpRd0FNU3pfb0NRWlQtbHFQb2JIUTRaY3BhY3c1YkkwZzJ3a3JvRzY1X0w0RXpacVBLaU5ZY21Ddk91NERfY3J6VHJJZFFuZ2Y2WGFCMlVya1libnFHT2hCVWVuV0lmYWoxQjBoVFFnWHpEN1dxSG1KRGpDV0hBcWtISk8tTDlueVlkWW1tTEVYV0FTUElYZmJ5SGFQbDZqU19aWDRwMmJsUWlfaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent discoveries in psychology and neuroscience are reshaping how we think about memory. Far from being a passive storehouse of past experiences, memory is an active, adaptable system influenced by emotion, attention, repetition, and even bodily processes like chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seven studies highlight how memories can blend together, become overly generalized under stress, or even form in non-neural cells. Together, they offer a clearer picture of the biological and psychological forces that shape our recollections and how those processes can go awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of California, Los Angeles reveals that when we experience similar events repeatedly—such as parking in the same spot daily—our memories can blend together, especially when one of those events is emotionally charged. This “memory attraction” was strongest in people with higher levels of anxiety and greater physiological reactivity to emotional stimuli. The study challenges the idea that our brains always exaggerate differences between similar memories to avoid confusion. Instead, it found that under certain emotional conditions, similar memories are remembered as being even more alike than they actually were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested this using pairs of similar-looking objects and faces, some paired with startling sounds to induce emotional arousal. Memory for the object colors was later tested, and people often remembered the colors as more similar than they really were—particularly if they were more anxious or had stronger physical responses to the aversive noise. The results suggest that emotional events can cause memories to blend rather than separate, which may help explain how anxiety can lead to overgeneralized fears or confusion between threatening and safe experiences. This blending may sometimes be adaptive, but in other cases, it could contribute to emotional disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; found that emotionally charged memories become more stable and vivid when they are repeated. This effect is driven by the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotional processing. When participants viewed negative images multiple times, their brain formed increasingly consistent patterns of activity in areas involved in memory, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices. These consistent patterns helped the participants remember emotional images better than neutral ones, even after several viewings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that this memory stabilization depended on the initial response of the amygdala. A strong emotional reaction during the first exposure to an image predicted more consistent brain activity in later repetitions, especially in the superior parietal lobule. This shows that the amygdala not only makes emotional events stand out initially but also strengthens how they are stored with repeated exposure. While this may help us learn from emotionally significant experiences, it also offers insight into why negative memories, such as those in post-traumatic stress disorder, can feel so enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chewing on harder substances like wood sticks—as odd as it sounds—may help improve memory, according to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that chewing wood increased levels of glutathione, a key antioxidant in the brain, in a region linked to cognitive control. Participants who showed the largest increases in glutathione also performed better on memory tests, particularly those measuring short-term recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared participants who chewed gum to those who chewed wooden sticks for five minutes. Only the wood group showed significant increases in brain glutathione levels. While the exact reason remains unclear, one theory is that the physical act of chewing harder materials stimulates blood flow and metabolic processes that support brain health. Though the study was small and involved only young adults, the findings raise intriguing possibilities for how diet and everyday behaviors could influence cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress doesn’t just heighten our memories—it can also make them less accurate. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; found that when mice experienced acute stress before learning, their brains formed larger and less specific memory traces. As a result, the animals showed fear responses to safe stimuli that resembled threatening ones, a behavior linked to conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overgeneralization occurred because stress disrupted the normal formation of memory networks in the brain’s amygdala. Typically, memories are encoded in a small, selective group of neurons. But under stress, more neurons than usual were recruited, blurring the boundaries between safe and threatening cues. The researchers traced this effect to the endocannabinoid system, which became overactive under stress and reduced the brain’s ability to limit which neurons were involved in memory formation. Blocking the system’s activity restored memory precision, pointing to potential targets for treating stress-related memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprising study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; suggests that memory isn’t exclusive to brain cells. Researchers found that human kidney and nerve-derived cells could “remember” chemical stimulation patterns in a way similar to neurons. These cells responded more strongly to chemical pulses that were spaced out over time—mirroring the “spaced learning” effect observed in neural memory studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used a glowing protein to track cellular responses, revealing that cells retained information about stimulation patterns for over 24 hours. This effect was driven by molecules like CREB and ERK, which are also critical for memory in neurons. The findings challenge long-standing assumptions about memory being unique to the nervous system and suggest that cells across the body may use similar mechanisms to process and retain information. This could open up new frontiers in medicine, such as training cells to behave in desired ways through patterned stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do memories last for years when the molecules that store them degrade in days? A study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; may have the answer. Researchers discovered that a molecule called KIBRA acts as a stabilizing anchor for another enzyme, PKMζ, which helps strengthen synapses—the connections between neurons. This interaction ensures that synapses involved in memory remain strong even as individual proteins are replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers disrupted the KIBRA-PKMζ interaction in mice, the animals lost previously learned spatial memories. This suggests that KIBRA helps maintain long-term memory by continually guiding new PKMζ molecules to the correct synapses. Like replacing the planks of a ship while keeping its shape intact, this system allows memories to persist despite ongoing molecular turnover. The discovery could lead to new treatments for memory disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition&lt;/em&gt; found that memory only directs our attention when we actively hold that memory in mind. Participants in the study were asked to retrieve, suppress, or substitute memories of specific objects associated with scenes. When allowed to freely recall the memories, participants’ eyes were drawn to the remembered objects, even if they weren’t relevant to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when participants were instructed to suppress or replace those memories, their attention was no longer guided by them—especially in the case of tools, which were easier to suppress than faces. This finding suggests that attention isn’t automatically hijacked by memory. Instead, memory influences attention only when it’s actively engaged. The study sheds light on how people might learn to control distracting or distressing thoughts, with potential applications for managing intrusive memories in conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:07:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOMkZ4bkpRd0FNU3pfb0NRWlQtbHFQb2JIUTRaY3BhY3c1YkkwZzJ3a3JvRzY1X0w0RXpacVBLaU5ZY21Ddk91NERfY3J6VHJJZFFuZ2Y2WGFCMlVya1libnFHT2hCVWVuV0lmYWoxQjBoVFFnWHpEN1dxSG1KRGpDV0hBcWtISk8tTDlueVlkWW1tTEVYV0FTUElYZmJ5SGFQbDZqU19aWDRwMmJsUWlfaQ</guid></item><item><title>药剂师警告影响癌症患者的药物短缺- BBC | Pharmacists warn drug shortage affecting cancer patients - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBJYWRZTXhOYzlNZnp6RGVZeTd5bFZubnlhbnBraVNmR3VnNk1CYTg5SEthWnJFOWFrVlp1WHZNbWRVa3hkcWhGTVRQbTY3Y1d3amI3VHZUbC1lZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFAxaUJHbVF0a1g5aWhSR0NqWHl6bmRtbG93MHBFODJvY2N1ZWpERTlmZGJHTm85d2V3MHQtTzBLYkZnRzU3bGZPcjhxUU10ay0zOWRVaHRyRlhUdUV2OTI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Pharmacists warn drug shortage affecting cancer patients&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Woman takes a box of medicine from a shelf lined with boxes of medicine.

digest his food without Creon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That month, leading pancreatic clinicians and charities wrote to the prime minister, saying the absence of Pert can have a "devastating impact on people's lives".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They called for a national strategy to tackle the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Alice

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She told the BBC: "Each day I'm trying to balance: what shall I eat, shall I have a more substantial meal, shall I take my supplements and that creates

tablets every time they eat simply to digest their food and absorb nutrients – something most of us take for granted," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's totally unacceptable

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea is one of the best teas for lowering blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps by relaxing blood vessels and reducing inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea can be enjoyed in many ways, from hot and cold beverages to food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy blood pressure acts as a silent guardian of our heart health. But high blood pressure, also called hypertension, occurs when blood flow pushes against vessels too forcefully.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Picture blood pressure like the pressure of water flowing through a hose. Too much pressure can damage the hose, just as high blood pressure can harm our blood vessels and organs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bring down blood pressure, what you eat and drink matters. Following certain diets, like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt;, is often recommended. This eating plan emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, while limiting salt, red meat, added sugar and foods containing high levels of saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to drink choices to support blood pressure, tea is a stellar sip. But science appears to suggest that one type of tea rises above the rest when it comes to managing high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-drink-green-tea-to-lower-high-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Drink Green Tea to Lower High Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world—second to plain old water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; True teas, which include teas made from the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt; plant, include black, green, white and oolong. These true teas are distinct from herbal teas, which come from an assortment of other herbs, spices and plants. True teas are a natural source of plant compounds and antioxidants that support many aspects of our health, including our hearts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Among the four varieties of true teas, green tea appears to have the most clinical data suggesting that sipping it regularly is linked to improved blood pressure, making it the top tea choice for hypertension. A meta-analysis evaluating the effects of green tea (via a drink or supplement) on high blood pressure found that green tea was effective in lowering blood pressure levels. Specifically, people benefitted from 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea contains catechins, a type of antioxidant that can improve blood vessel function and enhance heart health. They may do this by preventing the narrowing of arteries, improving nitric oxide production, which widens blood vessels, and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, the researchers point out.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the moderate amount of caffeine found in tea can stimulate a short-term increase in blood flow, potentially contributing to better overall cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-include-green-tea-in-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Include Green Tea in Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea can be enjoyed simply by steeping green tea leaves in hot water for three to five minutes—remove the tea leaves or bag before sipping. It also tastes great iced. However, there isn’t a specific recommendation for how much tea to drink to support healthy blood pressure. What is clear is that including green tea in your rotation, along with water, can be a good move.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you need a little sweetness in the mix, you can add some sugar, such as a touch of honey. Just be mindful of how much you add, as consuming too much added sugar is linked to elevated blood pressure in certain folks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides a classic cup of tea, try an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261767/apple-cider-vinegar-tonic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apple-Cider Vinegar Tonic&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252887/matcha-green-tea-latte/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Matcha Green Tea Latte&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to what you drink, green tea appears to be one of the best blood-pressure-friendly choices out there. Green tea contains compounds that have important roles in relaxing smooth muscle contraction, enhancing blood vessel dilation, reducing vascular inflammation and combating oxidative stress, all of which are important to manage hypertension.&lt;br&gt;

The review, which systematically examined the scientific literature on post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS), found that symptoms such as anxiety, mood swings, and sleep disturbances sometimes persist long after medication is discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were motivated by growing concerns about the long-term use of antidepressants and the lack of scientific attention paid to what happens when people try to stop. Antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world, and a significant number of users stay on them for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although short-term withdrawal symptoms are well-documented, there has been little research into what happens when withdrawal symptoms linger—what some researchers call post-acute withdrawal syndrome. This study aimed to systematically gather and evaluate existing data on how often PAWS occurs, how long it lasts, how severe it is, what factors might influence it, and what treatments are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers conducted a comprehensive search of major scientific databases, looking for original studies that reported persistent withdrawal symptoms after stopping newer antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. They used a predefined protocol and included a wide range of study types—case reports, observational studies, and surveys—so long as they contained original data. Ultimately, the review included seven studies that met their criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The included studies varied widely in methodology and quality. Some were peer-reviewed analyses of posts on online support forums, while others were clinical case reports or small prospective studies. One of the strongest pieces of evidence came from a large real-world randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom. That trial followed patients who discontinued antidepressants over several months and found that withdrawal symptoms could persist for up to 39 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of prevalence, one small study provided a rough estimate: in a group of 20 patients who had been prescribed paroxetine for panic disorder and agoraphobia, three individuals (15%) developed PAWS after gradually tapering their medication. This is a limited finding, drawn from a narrow patient population, and cannot be generalized to all antidepressant users. Still, it raises the possibility that persistent withdrawal symptoms are not rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to duration, the studies offered a wide range. Reports of PAWS lasting between one and a half months and nearly 14 years were found. On average, durations spanned from several months to a few years. One study based on online self-reports noted an average symptom duration of over two years. The most commonly reported symptoms included mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and sleep difficulties. In some cases, the symptom pattern resembled that of other mental health conditions, making it difficult to distinguish withdrawal from a relapse or a new disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for severity, several studies described PAWS as having a serious impact on quality of life. One case series reported that symptoms such as emotional instability, agitation, and physical discomfort significantly disrupted patients’ daily functioning. In another study, individuals self-identifying as experiencing PAWS reported that their symptoms were severe and persistent, sometimes causing them to seek help in online forums and support groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored possible risk factors. Long-term use of paroxetine—a commonly prescribed antidepressant—was repeatedly mentioned as a potential contributor to prolonged withdrawal. Other factors, such as the speed of tapering, did not consistently predict the severity or duration of symptoms. In some cases, people who tapered slowly still experienced long-lasting symptoms, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of treatment, the available options appeared limited and inconclusive. Some individuals found that reinstating the original antidepressant helped alleviate their symptoms, while others did not. A few patients tried other medications like benzodiazepines or beta blockers, with mixed results. One case series reported that cognitive-behavioral therapy seemed to help some patients over the course of several months, but this was based on only a few cases and lacked a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable findings of this review was how little high-quality research exists on PAWS. Most studies were based on self-reported data from online communities, which, while valuable, cannot provide definitive evidence due to selection bias and lack of medical verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one study used a randomized controlled design, and even that study did not include drugs like paroxetine or venlafaxine, which are known to cause more severe withdrawal symptoms. The authors note that this lack of rigorous research makes it impossible to estimate how common or severe PAWS truly is in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evidence gap has significant implications for clinical practice. Many doctors may be unaware of PAWS or may misinterpret persistent withdrawal symptoms as a return of the original mental health condition. This can lead to patients being placed back on medication unnecessarily or being diagnosed with a new disorder. Without clearer diagnostic guidelines or validated tools to distinguish PAWS from relapse, clinicians may struggle to provide appropriate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conclude that much more work is needed to understand PAWS. Larger, well-designed studies are necessary to determine how widespread the problem is and to identify which patients are most at risk. Randomized controlled trials are also needed to test potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S204579602500023X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) after stopping antidepressants: a systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Andri Rennwald and Michael P.

On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00108-2/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Common in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups," says Dr Abdul Gaffar, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. "We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Medical staff attend to Covid-positive patients in the ICU ward at the Holy Family hospital on May 06, 2021 in New Delhi, India" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Gram negative bacteria spread rapidly in places like hospital ICUs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need," says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Physicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Universal Images Group via Getty Images Colorized scanning electron micrograph showing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae interacting with a human neutrophil" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A electron micrograph of carbapenem-resistant bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all," says Dr Gaffar. "We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist," says Dr Gaffar. "Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&amp;amp;D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bears&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63059585" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance &lt;/a&gt;(AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics," says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80vrjkkrero" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;promising new antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to advanced diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Innovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a "hub-and-spoke approach" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programs, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Without access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access," says Dr Gaffar. "When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 21:34:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5uTEhXQmVfNlVYa0pDWVFBM1V4VzNkZGIwM1dZOXRsNF9GNTM2R1kzU1Nva3BKWWJnWXg0U2lHeS15bHFyRnhTOUh3MjVjc212UnlsUV9lRmVjZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBRYkZPZXJHTXQzb3ZsdG5FTDhodlNaZU90WXZKSE9qN3FTb0NXOWVaUjh4TVhjRmw5bmwwdndDbVhOTGF2NVJmUW1xUlpjQWl1Zzg3OFctbk1YSWNqU0tB</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，运动可提高结肠癌患者的生存率- KSL新闻 | Exercise boosts survival rates in colon cancer patients, study shows - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KINGSTON, Canada — A three-year exercise program improved survival in colon cancer patients and kept disease at bay, a first-of-its-kind international experiment showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the benefits rivaling some drugs, experts said cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care for colon cancer survivors. Until then, patients can increase their physical activity after treatment, knowing they are doing their part to prevent cancer from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely exciting study," said Dr. Jeffrey Meyerhardt of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn't involved in the research. It's the first randomized controlled trial to show a reduction in cancer recurrences and improved survival linked to exercise, Meyerhardt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior evidence was based on comparing active people with sedentary people, a type of study that can't prove cause and effect. The new study — conducted in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States — compared people who were randomly selected for an exercise program with those who instead received an educational booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about as high a quality of evidence as you can get," said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. "I love this study because it's something I've been promoting but with less strong evidence for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were featured Sunday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Academic research groups in Canada, Australia and the U.K. funded the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'We were just astounded'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 889 patients with treatable colon cancer who had completed chemotherapy. Half were given information promoting fitness and nutrition. The others worked with a coach, meeting every two weeks for a year, then monthly for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaches helped participants find ways to increase their physical activity. Many people, including Terri Swain-Collins, chose to walk for about 45 minutes several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something I could do for myself to make me feel better," said Swain-Collins, 62, of Kingston, Ontario. Regular contact with a friendly coach kept her motivated and accountable, she said. "I wouldn't want to go there and say, 'I didn't do anything,' so I was always doing stuff and making sure I got it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight years, participants in the structured exercise program not only became more active than those in the control group but also experienced 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause. There were more muscle strains and other similar problems in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we saw the results, we were just astounded," said study co-author Dr. Christopher Booth, a cancer doctor at Kingston Health Sciences Centre in Kingston, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Exercise causes improvements in survival'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise programs can be offered for several thousand dollars per patient, Booth said, "a remarkably affordable intervention that will make people feel better, have fewer cancer recurrences and help them live longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected blood from participants and will look for clues tying exercise to cancer prevention, whether through insulin processing or building up the immune system or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swain-Collins' coaching program ended, but she is still exercising. She listens to music while she walks in the countryside near her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of behavior change can be achieved when people believe in the benefits, when they find ways to make it fun and when there's a social component, said paper co-author Kerry Courneya, who studies exercise and cancer at the University of Alberta. The new evidence will give cancer patients a reason to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we can say definitively exercise causes improvements in survival," Courneya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 20:59:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw</guid></item><item><title>威尔士首次给予乳腺癌患者Capivasertib - BBC | Capivasertib given to breast cancer patients in Wales for first time - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9SWkhpQ3FkQXQxZ2w0TjN1ODRRZHJ5R3JKXzZFT3daMllWYjVLQ2RNUXNyQjNIVURpZ0xwemRxbFdxVXVXWXNheDVaVy1TakdqUS1XRzNmWTNxQdIBX0FVX3lxTFB3Yy1LNUtlMXVlOVVEUHBUdDhoVDJLbmVENno0MG5rd2lVZDdoR2tIOTJkNThHOEdLNE5DeHhZc1FxMXc5RjA4MmRKRkNjUlREWnNfdmFSMjRkS0ZVMUZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Cancer drug which could 'double survival time' rolled out &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Gwen, who has short blonde hair, is looking at the camera and smiling.

However, that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people in Wisconsin don't have nearly as many dangerous creatures to worry about, there are threats to those who enjoy spending time outdoors. &lt;span&gt;For example, it &lt;a href="https://b105country.com/deadly-insects-confirmed-in-wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;was recently &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://b105country.com/deadly-insects-confirmed-in-wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed &lt;/a&gt;that potentially deadly Asian needle ants were living in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These nasty little ants can sting through your clothes, leading to a possible infection, and, in some people, a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Asian needle ants are still pretty rare in &lt;a href="https://b105country.com/tags/wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, especially when compared to the deadliest creature on earth, which is found in abundance throughout the state, and they are now emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Deadliest Creatures On Earth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For perspective, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/what-animals-kills-the-most-people/" target="_blank"&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/a&gt; says the 10th-deadliest creature on the planet is the lion, which kills 200 humans per year. Then at #9 are hippos (killing 500 humans per year), followed by #8 elephants (killing 600 humans per year), #7 crocodiles (killing 1,000 humans per year), #6 scorpions (killing 3,300 humans per year), #5 assassin bugs (killing 10,000 humans per year by spreading the deadly Chagas disease), #4 dogs (killing 59,000 humans per year, mostly from rabies), #3 snakes (killing 138,000 humans per year), and #2 humans (killing 400,000 humans per year via homicide).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none can compare to the creature that sits atop this list. Despite weighing just 2.5 milligrams, these "silent feeders" kill a whopping 725,000 humans each year by spreading an array of diseases, including malaria, West Nile virus, Dengue Fever, Zika virus, Yellow Fever, and Chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadliest creature on Earth is the mosquito, the tiny little flying menace that has been the cause of much death worldwide, thanks to its spreading of disease, and has steered the course of human history on multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes are indeed deadly, with the majority of mosquito-related deaths occurring outside of the United States. Malaria infection is particularly bad in Africa, with the region accounting for 95% of cases and 96% of deaths worldwide. Tragically, children under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in that region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;According to the World Health Organisation,&lt;/a&gt; “malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mosquitoes Are Abundant In Wisconsin, Where They Can Spread Diseases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's impossible to give an exact number of mosquitoes in Wisconsin, &lt;a href="https://mosquitosite.russell.wisc.edu/mosquitoes-of-wisconsin/#:~:text=Wisconsin%20is%20home%20to%20at%20least%2056,biting%20people.%20Some%20prefer%20birds%20or%20amphibians." target="_blank"&gt;it's estimated&lt;/a&gt; that there are at least 56 different species of mosquitoes in the state. While many of these don't bite humans, some do, and that's when health issues can arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/climate/diseases.htm#:~:text=page.-,Diseases%20spread%20by%20mosquitoes,Eastern%20equine%20encephalitis%20(EEE)" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; (DHS), mosquitoes can carry and transmit several diseases within the state. This occurs when mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected animals, then transmit the virus to humans when they bite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common disease spread by mosquitoes in Wisconsin is the West Nile virus, which often causes mild flu-like symptoms but can also lead to severe illness in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other diseases they can spread in the state include La Crosse encephalitis, which primarily affects children and can lead to inflammation of the brain, Jamestown Canyon virus, Eastern equine encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE NOW:&lt;a href="https://b105country.com/safety-warning-for-people-hiking-in-wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt; Important Safety Warning Now Issued For All Hikers In Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin DHS &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/bite-prevention.htm#:~:text=Mosquitoes%20are%20usually%20most%20active,cold%20for%20them%20to%20survive." target="_blank"&gt;believes &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/bite-prevention.htm#:~:text=Mosquitoes%20are%20usually%20most%20active,cold%20for%20them%20to%20survive." target="_blank"&gt;that &lt;/a&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; 2025 mosquito season in Wisconsin is expected to be similar to past years, with peak activity typically occurring from May to September, but potentially lasting longer depending on temperatures. Factors like temperature and rainfall can influence mosquito populations, and warmer, wetter conditions could lead to more mosquitoes and potentially new species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding mosquito bites may seem impossible, but &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/tips-prevent-mosquito-bites#:~:text=Keep%20mosquitoes%20away%20from%20exposed,borne%20disease%20warning%20in%20effect." target="_blank"&gt;experts suggest&lt;/a&gt; the following tips to avoid getting bitten:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep mosquitoes away from exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuck shirts into pants and pants into socks to cover gaps in your clothing where mosquitoes can get to your skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay indoors when possible, especially if there is a mosquito-borne disease warning in effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use EPA-registered mosquito repellents when necessary and follow label directions and precautions closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use head nets, long sleeves, and long pants if you venture into areas with high mosquito populations, such as salt marshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace your outdoor lights with yellow "bug" lights, which tend to attract fewer mosquitoes than ordinary lights. The yellow lights are NOT repellents, however.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, to keep mosquitoes outside and not in your home, you should cover all gaps in walls, doors, and windows to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Also, make sure window and door screens are in good working order, and completely cover baby carriers and beds with netting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE NOW: &lt;a href="https://b105country.com/tsa-warning-for-airline-travelers-in-wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;TSA Issues An Important Warning To Airline Travelers In Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Abandoned Crazy Cat Lady House, Wisconsin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Hiking Wisconsin's Devil's Lake State Park&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowan and Tri-State Traveler Tom Drake and his family explore the bluffs, rock formations, and crystal clear water at Devil's Lake State Park in Baraboo, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Tom Drake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Duluth Country Radio</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 19:57:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5lYTY1UmhUekRZUXlZRWYyNi1mdzNaaF8wZUVkS1h5ZVNTVDJDQm1RRGhuNm5JLXRtNzhLX2l5WFhzSlNPZzkwS2xKZmprZTJXSDR2LTk5czdEclJ6VnRvb05WUDJWZw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现可永远冲出致癌化学物质的食物--《每日邮报》 | Scientists discover food that flushes out cancer-causing forever chemicals - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating more fiber might help flush out cancer-causing 'forever chemicals,' a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Boston compared men who took a fiber supplement three times a day to those who had a rice-based supplement for four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests revealed those who took beta-glucan fiber, found in mushrooms and oats, before every meal for four weeks had an eight percent reduction in 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), these toxic chemicals don't naturally break down in the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14210243/World-leading-scientist-reason-never-microwave-plastic-fertility-andrew-huberman.html"&gt;leech from plastic containers and nonstick cookware&lt;/a&gt; into food and build up in vital organs, increasing the risk of organ failure, infertility and some forms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-42f11330-3cc3-11f0-abb9-3b09f83b954a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe fiber helps filter out excess bile from the digestive tract, which PFAS latches on to to get absorbed by the bloodstream.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13186847/chemicals-scientists-toxic-PFAS-blood-heart.html"&gt;mountains of research&lt;/a&gt; has demonstrated the deadly effects of forever chemicals on the body, the new study is one of the first to offer a scientifically proven way to get rid of the toxins, which were thought to live in the body forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it comes as nine in 10 Americans don't consume enough fiber, raising their risk of other rising conditions like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13487377/deadly-diet-combos-colon-cancer-young-people.html"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at Boston University found fiber found in foods like oats can lower the amount of forever chemicals in the body (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to hamburger wrappers. It can remain in the environment as well as human tissue for years, even decades, before being cleared out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from Boston University, wrote: 'Despite the growing concerns about the toxicity of PFAS, specific interventions to reduce PFAS levels in the body are limited.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01165-8"&gt;Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt; in March, &lt;span&gt;looked at 72 adult men ages 18 to 65 with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 42 consumed a one-gram supplement of oat beta-glucan, a type of fiber naturally found in oats, mushrooms and seeds, three times a day, about 10 minutes before a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 30 participants consumed a rice-based control supplement instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers collected blood samples from each participant before and after the four-week experiment. Each test looked for 17 forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At baseline, 70 percent of participants had 11 of 17 forms of PFAS in their blood, and five forms were in every participant's blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found men who took the fiber supplement saw an eight percent decrease in perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), which are considered two of the most dangerous forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA and PFOS are synthetic chemicals used in firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and stain repellents to make them water and stain resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA is considered a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning it causes cancer in animals. PFOS, meanwhile, is a Group 2 carcinogen, suggesting it may cause cancer in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both chemicals are also thought to to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals, meaning they imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of - and response to - natural hormones like estrogen and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This increases the risk of developing hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe dietary fiber forms a gel that stips cells lining the gut from absorbing PFAS. This is because that gel stops bile acids, which help break down fats, from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, that excess bile gets excreted through feces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS is thought to latch on to bile and travel through the gut, so fiber may help flush forever chemicals out of the body before they can linger and cause lasting damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using blood tests, the researchers found men in the study had eight percent less PFOS and PFOA in four weeks than they did before the study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to forever chemicals and they have been linked to multiple cancers, asthma, fertility problems, obesity, birth defects, diabetes and autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned not all fiber gets rid of PFAS, and more research is needed to determine if other types have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to ridding the body of PFAS, fiber is also well known for adding weight to stools and making them easier to pass, reducing the risk of constipation and promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoother stools spend less time lingering in the colon, reducing the risk of harmful contaminants causing inflammation and triggering cells to grow uncontrollably. This lowers the likelihood of developing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 90 percent of Americans don't get the recommended 22 to 34 grams of fiber every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new study, with the main one being that PFAS can live in the body for two to seven years, so a four-week experiment was not enough time to properly assess the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also noted consuming higher levels of fiber may be necessary to reduce PFAS levels in the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each test looked for 17 forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At baseline, 70 percent of participants had 11 of 17 forms of PFAS in their blood, and five forms were in every participant's blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found men who took the fiber supplement saw an eight percent decrease in perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), which are considered two of the most dangerous forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA and PFOS are synthetic chemicals used in firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and stain repellents to make them water and stain resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA is considered a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning it causes cancer in animals. PFOS, meanwhile, is a Group 2 carcinogen, suggesting it may cause cancer in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both chemicals are also thought to to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals, meaning they imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of - and response to - natural hormones like estrogen and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This increases the risk of developing hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe dietary fiber forms a gel that stips cells lining the gut from absorbing PFAS. This is because that gel stops bile acids, which help break down fats, from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, that excess bile gets excreted through feces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS is thought to latch on to bile and travel through the gut, so fiber may help flush forever chemicals out of the body before they can linger and cause lasting damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using blood tests, the researchers found men in the study had eight percent less PFOS and PFOA in four weeks than they did before the study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to forever chemicals and they have been linked to multiple cancers, asthma, fertility problems, obesity, birth defects, diabetes and autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned not all fiber gets rid of PFAS, and more research is needed to determine if other types have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to ridding the body of PFAS, fiber is also well known for adding weight to stools and making them easier to pass, reducing the risk of constipation and promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoother stools spend less time lingering in the colon, reducing the risk of harmful contaminants causing inflammation and triggering cells to grow uncontrollably. This lowers the likelihood of developing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 90 percent of Americans don't get the recommended 22 to 34 grams of fiber every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new study, with the main one being that PFAS can live in the body for two to seven years, so a four-week experiment was not enough time to properly assess the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also noted consuming higher levels of fiber may be necessary to reduce PFAS levels in the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

										&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variant called LP.8.1 is currently the dominant version in the U.S. and globally. ___&lt;/p&gt;
