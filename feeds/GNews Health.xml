			&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; in the break room at work could contain high levels of substances that elevate levels of 'bad' cholesterol in your blood – but there's a simple way to reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;Diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; are compounds made by plants that have a variety of effects on the human body. Two of them – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"&gt;cafestol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahweol"&gt;kahweol&lt;/a&gt; – have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20174238"&gt;linked to increased levels&lt;/a&gt; of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. &lt;span&gt;High levels of these compounds have been found in coffee, but it seems to depend on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-way-to-brew-coffee-depends-on-what-you-want-from-your-java"&gt;how you extract it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish researchers measured the levels of diterpenes in coffee made by a range of common coffee machines and brewing techniques. They found that boiling a big pot of coffee is the worst offender, but you can easily offset those levels by filtering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee machines commonly found in workplaces around the world also produced cups of joe with relatively high diterpene levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We studied 14 coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says David Iggman&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical nutritionist at Uppsala University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team calculated the benefits for a person drinking three cups of coffee a day, five days a week. Swapping the machine coffee for a nice paper-filtered java could reduce LDL cholesterol by enough to cut the relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by 13 percent over 5 years, and 36 percent over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected samples from 11 machines that brewed coffee from grinds mixed with hot water and passed through a metal filter, and from a further three that mixed a liquid coffee concentrate with hot water without filtration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the team also brewed coffee themselves using a range of methods, including drip-brew, percolator, French press, and boiled coffee. Samples from each method and machine were then frozen for storage and transport, before being analyzed for diterpene concentration. &lt;span&gt;In addition, the team collected four espresso samples from three cafeterias and a workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg" alt="How You Make Your Coffee Could Affect Your Cholesterol Intake" class="wp-image-156189 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-728x415.jpg 728w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-600x342.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol.jpg 1555w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How the different brewing methods stack up in terms of cafestol concentrations. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;Orrje et. al, &lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that manual methods of brewing coffee generally resulted in lower diterpene levels than grabbing a cup from a machine, &lt;span&gt;whether it be a brewing machine, a liquid-model machine, or a traditional espresso maker&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a glance, espresso seemed to be the worst way to make coffee, with a median cafestol level of around 1,060 mg/L. But there were only four samples analyzed and their levels varied wildly, from 35.6 to a staggering 2,446.7 mg/L. As such, it's hard to pull much meaning out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee from liquid and brewing machine models had a median cafestol concentration of 174 milligrams per liter, and 135 mg/L of kahweol. French presses produced coffees with moderate diterpene levels, coming in under 90 mg/L for cafestol and under 70 mg/L for kahweol, while percolators had similar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be paper-filtered drip brews, clocking a median of just 11.5 mg/L of cafestol and 8.2 mg/L for kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception was boiled coffee, a typically unfiltered method that's common in countries such as Sweden. Getting your  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; fix this way resulted in a massive mean concentration of just under 940 mg/L of cafestol and nearly 680 mg/L of kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg" alt="filtering coffee" class="wp-image-156292 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filtering coffee could make a big difference to your health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdcijLL8g/"&gt;Andreantian/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it's easy to slash those levels. When the researchers filtered their boiled coffee through fabric, concentrations dropped to just 28 mg/L for cafestol and 21 mg/L for kahweol. They used a sock for some reason, but any cloth or paper filter should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also acknowledges that the study has major limitations, including small sample sizes and variables that went unaccounted for, like filter pore size, water pressure, and temperature, and how the beans were roasted and ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings join a growing and often conflicting body of research into the health effects of coffee – and it's hard to know how it all fits together. Other studies, for instance, have found that drinking three or more cups of coffee per day could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiometabolic diseases by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular coffee consumption has also been linked to lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-coffee-and-tea-drinkers-could-be-lowering-their-risk-of-dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-help-protect-against-parkinsons-study-says"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-protect-against-certain-types-of-skin-cancer"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-tea-or-coffee-each-day-could-reduce-mouth-and-throat-cancer-risk"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It could offset the negative health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;prolonged sitting&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;extend your life&lt;/a&gt; by years. But that could all depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;how many cups&lt;/a&gt; you down per day, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;what time&lt;/a&gt; you drink them – and now, how you brew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says Iggman&lt;/a&gt;. "For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it's clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(13 News) - Casino Del Sol has confirmed that a norovirus outbreak caused the cancellation of a large convention over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention was set for March 20-23 at the casino. But on Saturday, Casino Del Sol canceled the rest of the event over “ongoing medical concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;On Tuesday, the casino sent a release to 13 News and explained more about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness,” the casino said. “An individual associated with the event informed Casino Del Sol management that a guest of the group reported that she had norovirus and at least two attendees were already ill before arriving at the event. By Saturday, March 22, additional attendees, as well as a few Casino Del Sol team members, reported experiencing stomach flu-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild West Steampunk Convention &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/843226430/Wild-West-Steampunk-Convention-news-release" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;issued a news release&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and said it had not received an official reason for the cancellation until Casino Del Sol issued its release to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It seems Casino Del Sol has put out a press release this evening confirming norovirus as the cause of their decision to close Wild Wild West Con,” the WWSC wrote. “We want to be clear that this is the first time we have been made aware of this development and it was provided to the press rather than to our staff or management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;13 News went to the casino Saturday and saw no signs about the event on the property or near the conference center, where it was held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Pascua Yaqui Tribal Medical Authority and the casino said it “took immediate action to mitigate potential health risks.” The casino reported that the conference center, public restrooms and the rooms the ill guests were staying were deep cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Several people on social media complained about the short notice for the cancellation. The casino said vendors and attendees were told two hours ahead that they had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately,” the casino said. “While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some people on social media also complained about the lack of information that was released during the weekend and the fact that the casino remained open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate,” the casino said. “Our priority throughout this process has been the well-being of our guests, team members, and the greater community. By acting quickly, we were able to contain the situation and reduce the potential for further illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Still others on social media called out the WWWSC for deleting a social media post made Saturday afternoon. The WWWSC said it did so “at the insistence of (Casino Del Sol) in an effort to maintain a working relationship during a difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The WWWSC said it asked Pima County about the incident and was told “the Pascua Yaqui Health Department is managing the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entire Casino Del Sol Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness.

Out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to conclude the event early and begin a deep cleaning of the conference center. Additionally, all hotel rooms that housed event guests were placed on hold to undergo a deep cleaning and sanitization process, in line with our already rigorous cleaning protocols.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vendors and attendees were given two hours’ notice to vacate the event space. This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately.

This was based on the origin of the reported illness. As an added precaution, all occupied hotel rooms and public restrooms underwent an enhanced deep-cleaning and sanitization process in addition to the hotel’s already robust and comprehensive cleaning procedures for every room. Guests who were not affiliated with the event were not impacted by this precautionary measure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate.

Researchers have now discovered that postpartum female mice develop a long-term preference for cooler environments, driven by brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes involve a specific group of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα).

The number and activity of ERα-expressing POA neurons (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and in vitro electrophysiology in response to temperature changes and ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025a"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We showed that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting long term postpartum. Female mice with RE (&amp;gt;4 weeks post-weaning) displayed lower body temperature and a lower thermal preferred temperature, and lost preference for warm environments (30 °C) but preserved avoidance of cold environments (15 °C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was associated with a significant decrease in the number of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Importantly, virgin female ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;-KO mice displayed lower thermal preferred temperature and impaired warm preference, mimicking RE mice. We further found that distinct ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations can be regulated by temperature changes with or without presynaptic blockers, and by ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, RE decreased the number of warm-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and reduced the excitatory effects of warmth and estrogen-ERα signaling, while cold-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were slightly enhanced in female mice with RE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030a"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results support that the thermosensing ability and estrogenic effects in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are regulated by reproductive experience, altering thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9WeFpHdEdOMXV1TGtTOHNEVXpUWThhUTBXOW41THozQ0wzaGlLODJ5bDk3VXZzN0FMdWFPM0JiNWl6bDNRVEh4Nld3WnFKaTExSXprRHRLbDZEeHYydlMyUlJHU3lGaFlYbmlfbFJRQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine skeptic hired to head federal study of immunizations and autism - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeHd0cUdpVXZra0JMY1FTRFo3SWtWTWFPY190OG9HbE0zTDlyaE8xeDNWZjJuSkhRbzhUejNlMmh1eXlKeXh0U0d6ZEhFeXpJeUZ3bW03Qmt3V01DQkVOQTZWdnZpd3lHc1kyWkM5d09HSmtoQXJVMy02Z19EWUhCSjljTUpkUjN6bVliSmR1WjdQQXBTb3JTSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLFJMKAJMZHLLC7ATDVDOJ5ACU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A vaccine skeptic who has long promoted false claims about the connection between immunizations and autism has been tapped by the federal government to conduct a critical study of possible links between the two, according to current and former federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NXYZMVKG45AQBHTJ47S2ON4WDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Using advanced MRI scans and blood tests, researchers identified elevated iron in key brain regions and signs of nerve damage in ADHD patients compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers are known precursors to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The findings suggest a potential biological mechanism linking ADHD to a higher risk of dementia later in life, underscoring the importance of early ADHD diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with ADHD had increased brain iron in regions associated with cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerve Damage Indicator:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated blood levels of NfL, a marker of axonal damage, were found in ADHD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The combination of iron buildup and NfL suggests ADHD may increase the risk of age-related dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An adult brain affected by attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) presents modifications similar to those observed in individuals suffering from dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the findings of a study conducted by the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the University of Geneva (UNIGE) which shows that, compared with healthy individuals, patients with an ADHD diagnosis have more iron in certain regions of their brain along with higher levels of neurofilaments (NfL) in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers have been consistently reported to be characteristic of old age-related dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease and can be measured in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that ADHD may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life and it provides first evidence for a neurological mechanism possibly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significant step forward is described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 3.5% of adults according to a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) study. It is characterized by an inability to maintain attention along with inappropriate levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although symptoms generally manifest during childhood and significantly affect educational development and social interactions, its effects can persist and adversely affect daily functioning in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old age-related dementias affect about 55 million people globally, with almost 10 million new cases each year according to WHO statistics from 2023. Alzheimer’s disease represents 60 to 70% of these dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent epidemiological studies show that adults suffering from ADHD have an increased risk of dementia at an advanced age, but the mechanism through which ADHD constitutes a risk is not known,” states Professor Paul G. Unschuld, Head of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of the HUG, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and the initiator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron and neurofilaments as indicators &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used an advanced brain imaging method, known as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine iron content in the brain of 32 adults between 25 – 45 years of age affected by ADHD and 29 healthy individuals in the same age bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels in the blood of the participants were measured in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study reveal notable differences in iron distribution in several regions of the brain of the individuals affected by ADHD. Furthermore, a significant association was established between iron levels in the precentral cortex and NfL levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron plays an essential role in normal brain functioning, but its excessive accumulation may cause neuronal damage and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess iron in certain regions of the brain is often observed and is associated with increased oxidative stress that furthers neuronal degeneration,” specifies Professor Paul Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the NfL is an indicator of neuronal damage in the brain, more specifically of neuronal axons which are essential for nerve transmission. High blood levels of NfL reflect axon damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, an increased brain iron and NfL levels may indicate an underlying neurodegenerative pathology and an increased risk of neurodegenerative dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of early detection and management of ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries pave the way for new research into understanding why persons with ADHD may be at increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Paul Unschuld believes that the information provided by this study “will enable targeted prevention strategies to be developed to reduce the risk of dementia in persons affected by ADHD. This is especially important since there is a well-known correlation between lifestyle and altered iron levels in brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To achieve this, additional longitudinal studies are required in order to determine if a reduction of iron levels in the brain is a potential treatment pathway for preventing dementia at an advanced age in persons with ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the relationship between ADHD and dementia underlines the importance of early detection of these diseases. It also highlights the importance of proactive management of ADHD in adults, not only to improve quality of life for individuals but also to prevent long-term consequences on cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by a SPARK grant awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) to Professor Paul G.

Here, we investigated the liability for neurodegenerative brain disease in adult ADHD, possibly reflected by increased brain iron content and associated neuroaxonal vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two adults with ADHD (35 ± 10 years) and 29 age- and sex-matched controls (32 ± 12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized psychometric testing and assessment of lifestyle factors. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to assess magnetic abnormalities indicating local alterations of iron deposition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By calculating QSM-maps, local iron deposition was tested for statistically significant differences between ADHD and healthy controls. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured as an indicator of neuroaxonal integrity by using a fourth-generation ELLA immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain iron content differed in persons with ADHD, with strongest effects observable in the right precentral cortex (healthy controls: 0.0033 ± 0.0017ppm; ADHD: 0.0048 ± 0.0016ppm; &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(59) = 3.56, &lt;em&gt;P &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt; 0.001). Moreover, right precentral cortex iron in persons with ADHD was associated with increased blood NfL levels (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1.57) = 13.2, &lt;em&gt;P =&lt;/em&gt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate altered regional iron content in the brains of adults with ADHD. The observed association between increased precentral magnetic susceptibility and increased NfL suggests a connection between local excess of brain iron and neuroaxonal damage in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited sample size of the current study and the naturalistic medication plan, further longitudinal studies are needed to establish whether altered brain iron distribution in adults with ADHD may be associated with an increased risk of dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:37:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFB4X0lsdWlJRThhdmVtUVU0ZUdFRUNHazZ2UDYxZE5uQm5pSDFTU1VSTDg2ejlqYUlGUmp6Nk9kZkxDVVI4LU52UUpyeDZSNXJRQTljVXlaaXNxTFNWX3VDQ2NIdVNaLVVWa0RuY0ZYOA</guid></item><item><title>Measles vaccine: Can young children get an early dose of the MMR shot? - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the 420-plus cases have been centered around the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, which has spilled over to neighboring &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/ok-measles-update.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.

Some parents, however, are opting to give their young children a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226" target="_blank"&gt;dose of the vaccine ahead of schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock — an epicenter of the current outbreak — said that parents are calling to request an early dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve almost doubled the amount of vaccine we administer on a typical month,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20routine,elapsed%20since%20the%20first%20dose).&amp;amp;text=There%20are%20no%20recommendations%20to,MMR%20vaccine%20during%20measles%20outbreaks." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Protecting-Your-Baby-from-a-Measles-Outbreak-FAQs.aspx#measles-travel-baby" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; say that, in the case of an outbreak or international travel, children as young as 6 months can get a dose of the vaccine, and children under 4 years old who have gotten one dose can get their second one earlier. All doses must be separated by at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Shilpa Patel, a pediatrician at New Jersey Hackensack Meridian Health Medical Group Northern Valley Pediatrics, said that an early dose before 12 months is essentially a bonus dose, and doesn’t take the place of either of the two standard doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It does not count for the total,” Patel said. “You still need two doses after the age of 12 months.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez said that’s because, “at this age of development, their immune system isn’t quite developed to where the vaccine would provide prolonged or lifelong immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Therefore, we would have to give another dose at a year and essentially a third dose at 4 to 6 years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While early doses are typically recommended when traveling abroad with children, Patel said she’s also starting to recommend the vaccine for kids traveling to some parts of the U.S., including Texas and Disney World in Florida. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreak-traced-disneyland-declared-over-n343686" target="_blank"&gt;Theme parks&lt;/a&gt; have been the sites of measles outbreaks in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Don Gibson, 36, and his wife considered early vaccinations for their two sons, now ages 2 years and 4 months, as they prepared&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in January to travel from California to Texas for an April wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We were really excited to go, and they invited our kids, too, so we were going to take the whole family, but, then, after we booked our travel, including lodging, flights, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak happening in Texas&lt;/a&gt;,” Gibson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This prompted a conversation with the family pediatrician, who said they could give an early second dose for their 2-year-old and a dose for the infant when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reached 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The wedding, however, would occur before the infant hit 6 months, and ultimately the family decided to cancel their plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patel said that she’s even started offering an early dose to families who aren’t traveling, but who are concerned about rising measles counts in their neighborhood, pointing to the &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;three measles cases&lt;/a&gt; recently identified in her home state, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For now, doses for domestic travel and for patients in places without active outbreaks are being given at the discretion of individual doctors and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7146a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;no official recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling domestically to places experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some are calling for changing that to include a flexible third dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an article earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, former CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and several other experts proposed codifying an extra dose for high-risk domestic travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez noted that it’s unclear whether insurance will cover an extra dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She said that 80% of her patients are on Medicaid and have their regular immunizations covered by the Texas Vaccines for Children program. But, because these particular doses are given outside of the standard schedule, it remains unclear whether they will be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, the extra dose is the parents’ choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If you decide you want to do this, you are welcome to,” Montanez said. “If you don’t want to do this, you don’t have to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE</guid></item><item><title>For Some Measles Patients, Vitamin A Remedy Supported by RFK Jr. Leaves Them More Ill - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5WN3RzNzZZNlF0QkE3QzQwOGktWU5yR2RZemZ6VllWUUI3TV9nTEtCQm9Dc2RYYkkwcWRFaHl6RUNLbkRYS0dBNUZXaEhLTjJTa0syUzdLWGNGcDRScFl0VWl0S1pCbkZNclJPZHYtc0wzVTYzWVpBMUYwN0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors in West Texas are seeing measles patients whose illnesses have been complicated by an alternative therapy endorsed by vaccine skeptics including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of those supplements is vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of them had received unsafe doses of supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks,” Dr. Davies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While doctors sometimes administer high doses of vitamin A in a hospital to manage severe measles, experts do not recommend taking it without physician supervision.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still largely unsure what's behind the epidemic, but obesity, diets high in processed meats and sugar, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental exposures like microplastics and antibiotics are several of the top theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While bloody stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are tell-tale signs of colon cancer, Ms Comer had no symptoms leading up to her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the only sign of trouble was elevated liver enzymes during a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver enzymes are proteins that help the liver produce and break down bile and rid the body of toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer that has spread to the liver damages protective cells and can lead to excess enzymes flooding into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer told ABC 7 News that following her diagnosis, she would spend eight to 11 hours three days every other week in doing chemotherapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also underwent seven surgeries to remove the tumors from her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after 180 rounds of chemotherapy and between 60 and 70 scans, Ms Comer made the decision to stop treatment and enter hospice care at home this year due to the lasting wear and tear from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemo was making me sicker so I couldn't recover.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Comer, pictured here with her husband and daughter, is now in hospice care and focusing on encouraging young patients to get screened for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said that over the years, her advice to young people and doctors has stayed the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm really a pain in the butt. I keep saying the same thing - screen early,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45. Prior to 2021, this began at age 50, making Ms Comer miss the age requirement to catch her cancer before it spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said: 'To the problem in your life, you are the answer and you are the solution. You have to figure it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is no longer seeking treatment, she noted her husband and 17-year-old daughter have helped keep her from giving up on life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Who would want to leave, who would want to leave this beautiful world with all this kindness?' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPaEdLdkE3eHZFOV9BdkZiZXdKdUJvaXVRU0pDQ0ZKSXc0UkcxeVdndmduMEZJUUR1Umx0YlN6dGdqRmVselVXVHpGLTQtVXhCTlY2d29kamN0STZvcXU5Y1p6ZERsVWpYc2k3LVpQRTR4aGRQTHE4MTBIWXZCRlJscjdSZ2Z6WGtMVVRkWC11c3NzUnlnMUZ5SElRR2V1TWFG0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5kdF9YR1lFZmxmX2p3UGZiZkhtWmFORGQtV3BVSVFTazRka2xrSDJMLVZqa0VjcmxrdWxoUmJPckFoT1p3VkJZQ0ZqRVVRU1JaSWtudk1FSHpDaTE2ZFVqcnU5a3FqWG9oQ3JYdnVsTmVHaVM1a3RFSkJhdHhPWjA5aV84QW83cFkxUXpvc2lBNUVxLURLdnVfNnNMV3RBYjZXTzNLMkE</guid></item><item><title>Is Creatine the Midlife Wonder Supplement You’re Missing? - Oprah Mag</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFA3MUFHbHVLalJaSERkU3ZFODJhdC00MTNMS3JlVHBPQ0VjS2VTb3ozYmlVV2JTaGpoY0ZqNnRaOFBvOUhDOWl3aldkNEthUWR1TU9QbzFRVjAtb21IMlZFVVA0SjB5M0FFYTFydGxwZ050eFFNOUhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-1p2egzz emevuu60"&gt;When Laura Taft, 62, first started supplementing with creatine at the suggestion of her trainer, it was with her muscles in mind. “I wanted to resist bone density loss as I age,” says the Brooklyn resident. But within a few weeks of taking creatine daily, Taft clocked a benefit that she hadn’t anticipated: a cognitive one. “In addition to strength building, creatine has been really helpful with lifting my brain fog,” she says. The best evidence of that, she adds, may be that she remembers to take it every day. Taft’s experience reflects a broader shift in creatine’s target audience. Once a word rarely heard uttered outside of powerlifting circles, nowadays creatine is attracting new interest among women—and middle-aged women at that.

Creatine is produced in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and the majority of it (around 95 percent) is stored in our skeletal muscles, says Stacey Ellery, PhD, a pregnancy physiologist and research group head of biogenetics in reproduction at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia. But while the body may naturally produce creatine, that amount covers only a portion of what your muscles use, particularly if you’re active or working on building them, says board-certified ob-gyn &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Claire Haver, MD" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Mary Claire Haver, MD&lt;/a&gt;. And though creatine is also found in animal-based foods like red meat, poultry, and fish, for your body (and brain) to really reap the benefits, you’d need to eat a few pounds a day. Hence: supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="3" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How creatine helps muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the ’90s, supplementing with creatine rose to popularity among the body-building masses, as did the first wave of scientific studies supporting its ability to bolster muscle mass. How does it do it? “Creatine phosphate stored in muscles is responsible for supplying energy for quick anaerobic bouts of muscle contraction,” says Heather A. Milton, an exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone Health. We use those CP stores within 10 to 30 seconds, she adds, so the higher the stores we have in the muscles, the more our energy output. “This means creatine provides more capacity to lift a heavier load and withstand fatigue while doing so, and that increased strength of work produces greater muscle growth,” says Milton. So you’re able to train harder, lift heavier, and, crucially, recover faster, because creatine is key both for muscle metabolism and muscle repair.  But it’s important to remember that taking creatine alone won’t magically grow your muscles. “It’s the increased capacity to train that most people experience when taking creatine that results in increased muscle mass and exercise performance,” says Ellery.&lt;br data-node-id="4.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="6" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How the rest of your body may benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the research on creatine and muscle is long-standing and robust, newer research points to additional benefits. One area is the brain, which makes sense, considering that the brain relies on ample amounts of ATP (which, as a reminder, creatine helps create) to function. “When creatine stores are low, brain cells may have a harder time keeping up with the energy demands of thinking, processing, information, and managing stress,” says Haver. Thus far, says Bayati, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies have shown" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; creatine to be beneficial for &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive function " data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;cognitive function &lt;/a&gt;in stressful situations or with sleep deprivation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Studies have shown creatine to be beneficial for maintaining cognitive function in stressful situations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another area of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research growth is reproductive health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;research growth is reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. “Estrogen levels affect creatine metabolism and play a role in both the synthesis and bioavailability of creatine,” says Bayati. This is why creatine levels fluctuate with your menstrual cycle and other hormonal changes, like the drop in estrogen during menopause. Not to mention that key players in the reproductive process (sperm, uterus, placenta, and fetus) rely on creatine as a source of cellular energy. “Observational studies suggest that in some cases, low creatine levels are associated with fertility complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes,” says Ellery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Why women in midlife may be the biggest winners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is not a one-size-fits-all recommendation for every woman hovering around midlife. But most doctors agree that, besides vegans and vegetarians (who noticeably lack it in their diets), middle-aged women stand to benefit from it because it can help mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass, as well as the brain fog that is common in perimenopause. The fact that creatine not only increases exercise performance but also specifically targets changes in energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with insufficient estrogen is huge for women in midlife, says Ellery. She adds that creatine is also fast becoming a therapeutic intervention of interest for diseases more prevalent in female populations, such autoimmune and major depressive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For Veerle Arts, a 39-year-old strength and mobility coach and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Breuckelen Athletic" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Breuckelen Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, New York, a podcast interview with &lt;a href="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stacy Sims" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, talking about creatine in the context of women’s health and performance benefits first piqued her curiosity. “After taking it for four weeks, I began to notice that I could scale up my workouts and sustain a higher intensity.

And two months in, I had noticeably put on more muscle,” says Arts, adding that she has been taking it for 10 months and has no plans to stop. “Most of my female clients over 40 are either considering creatine or already taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Are these supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine’s use as a dietary supplement has been studied for decades, and it is widely regarded as safe. In the ’90s, it got some negative press due to a case study linking it to kidney injury, says Ellery. But that study has since been debunked and superseded by thorough safety reviews. (Still, people with kidney issues should check with their doctors before taking the supplement.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Because the supplement market is wildly and widely unregulated, paying attention to source and quality are key, says Milton. Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard, says Haver—specifically products that are third-party tested (like those certified by the &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cleanlabelproject.org" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clean Label Project" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;) for purity, potency, and contaminants. The clinically effective dose that doctors usually recommend is 3 to 5 grams a day, though people who are keen to saturate their muscles faster, says Haver, will sometimes “creatine load,” which involves taking a higher dose (20 grams per day, split into four doses) for five to seven days. “But that isn’t necessary, especially if you’re in this for long-term health and maintenance.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Consistency matters more than anything else, and, as with any supplement, it’s important to note that there is a range of responsiveness: Some people experience mild side effects like water retention or gastrointestinal upset, and some people experience a benefit while others don’t.  Additionally, many doctors recommend taking it for up to five years, since its effects beyond that time frame are not well documented. The bottom line? For women eager to shore up their mental and physical strength in midlife, it may be worth trying.&lt;br data-node-id="17.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-tip css-tax92z emevuu60"&gt;Any content published by Oprah Daily is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

                                        &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles in southwest Kansas continues to grow. &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;State health data shows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 10 people in Grant, Stevens and Morton counties, all under the age of 18, have tested positive for measles since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment first &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported a measles case in Stevens County March 13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. But the state’s measles dashboard also shows two cases, one in January and one in February. A state health department spokesperson said those cases were “retrospectively identified” and part of the current outbreak. The eight other cases were recorded this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said during a health conference in Wichita that state officials are closely monitoring the outbreak and are ensuring infected people are isolated. She also urged Kansans to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are safe and effective,” Kelly said. “I have two kids. They were both vaccinated. They are alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify a measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as three or more cases linked to each other. This makes Kansas one of the most recent states with a measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas has the largest outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 300 cases of the measles. Health experts say the disease can lead to serious complications, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed one death amid the outbreak in Texas. In New Mexico, health officials are investigating the cause of death for a person who tested positive for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of the illness in Kansas comes as state lawmakers in Topeka are considering a bill that includes loosening vaccine requirements in child care regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is aimed at reducing specific fees and training requirements for early child care facilities. But a provision expands religious exemptions for vaccines that are required for child care programs. The Kansas House recently approved the bill with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas vaccine advocates argue the requirement changes could reduce vaccine rates amid a growing public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more unvaccinated children you have in a setting, the more likely it is that measles or whatever will go through the population,” said Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director for Kansas Interfaith Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is measles? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. It spreads through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection and prevention at the University of Kansas Health System, said the illness can linger in the air for up to two hours. He said he expects to see the number of cases in Kansas rise because of how easy measles spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the decrease in overall vaccine rates, I think we have to expect there to be more cases,” he said, “Just because the less people vaccinated means more people that are susceptible to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles can potentially cause severe health problems, like pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to brain damage and deafness. He said one in five people who contract measles are hospitalized and it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very devastating disease,” Hawinkson said. “It is unfortunate because we know we have the best proactive safety measure, and that is the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say nine of the 10 Kansans who tested positive for measles were unvaccinated, and one was under vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles symptoms typically start like a common cold. An infected person may have a fever, sore throat, runny nose and mild cough. About two to three days later, the person may develop white &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spots in their mouth, known as Koplik spots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. About three to five days later, the person will develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a red, splotchy rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Hawksinson said usually starts on a person’s head and face and then spreads downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/measles-keeping-family-safe.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts say if you suspect you or your child has measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s best for them to stay home away from other people. Hawkinson said it’s also important to call ahead before bringing someone with a possible infection to the doctor, emergency room or urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really best to call ahead so that they can take those preparations into account, so that they can protect other people in those areas,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department website has more information about &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1501/Measles-Rubeola#:~:text=Providers%20%26%20LHD%20Resources%20Table%20Section,not%20wait%20for%20test%20results." class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles and what to watch for.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson encourages full vaccination against measles as the best way to avoid contracting the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been used for five to six decades,” Hawkinson said. “It has a great history of safety. It has a great history of effectiveness at preventing disease and especially the complications of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;There are two types of vaccines for measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: MMR and MMRV. Children need two doses of either vaccine to be fully protected against measles. The first dose should be administered when a child is between 12 and 15 months old and the second should be when a child is between four and six years old. However, the MMVR second dose can be administered as early as 3 months after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said now is a good time to check you and your family’s vaccination status. He said unvaccinated children and adults or people who didn’t receive both doses of the vaccine should consider getting them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

About 90% of Kansans are vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, state lawmakers have challenged vaccine requirements in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas House recently approved a &lt;a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2294/?link_id=1&amp;amp;can_id=ddf8202ea341214def057893c988d994&amp;amp;source=email-action-alert-tell-your-house-member-to-protect-the-kansas-supreme-court&amp;amp;email_referrer=email_2662630&amp;amp;email_subject=action-alert-on-childhood-immunizations&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing or eliminating fees and training requirements for child care facilities. That bill includes a provision that adds moral and ethical opposition to the definition of religious exemptions for vaccines that children are required to get before attending child care programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, said the change is reckless. He said most major religions approve of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In anti-vax sentiment, sometimes it’s called 'religious' but actually, it is more about people’s fears,” Rieber said. “There’s not really a religious basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said changing the definition of religious exemption for vaccine requirements at childcare facilities could also open the door to changes for K-12 public schools, which require several other vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said he supports expanding access to affordable child care in Kansas, but the amendment could harm vaccinated and unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is the potential for this to be a precedent that would then take away the ability of the school or the facility to actually protect their children by not allowing unvaccinated children to be in the setting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House floor did not discuss the details of the bill or the reasons to include the vaccine exemption changes before voting to approve it. The bill is now in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

Her death certificate attributed the cause to viral fever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever - which got its name because a majority of cases are found in Arizona and California - is a deadly lung infection that kills one in 100 people who contract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, there were approximately 200 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths each year from 1999 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley fever is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which &lt;span&gt;is swept up into the air when soil contaminated with the fungus is disturbed by wind or digging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;States usually report a total of 10,000 to 20,000 cases of Valley fever yearly. In 2024, Arizona - where most cases emerge - reported a total of 11,801 confirmed and probable cases of Valley fever, higher than last year's total count of 10,990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When humans or animals breathe in the spores, they travel through the respiratory tract and into the lungs where they reproduce and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, skin and liver through the bloodstream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it infects the membranes and fluid around the brain and cause life-threatening meningitis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease, for which there is currently no preventative vaccine, can often be missed by doctors or misdiagnosed as pneumonia as it presents with similar symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, aching muscles and breathlessness.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include blurry vision, cognitive decline, hearing changes, night sweats, joint aches and a red rash, usually on the legs but occasionally on the chest, arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no current cure and patients are given treatments to manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, parts of Mexico, Central America and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown, nobody in Roselia's family had ever heard about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico. Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about her mother's final days, Aide told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/03/24/valley-fever-el-paso-dust-storms-disease/"&gt;El Paso Matters&lt;/a&gt;: 'My mom doesn't play around like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What damaged my mom more was we didn't know what it was, so we didn't know how to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Mom felt like she was going crazy, Now I want everyone to know it doesn't just happen to people living in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-35462820-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-35462821-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-35462822-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It's present [in Texas], too.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr &lt;span&gt;Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at &lt;/span&gt;Texas&lt;span&gt; Tech Health, El Paso, who was not involved in Roselia's care, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms and usually only have a cough and fever, like many other common respiratory illnesses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Sometimes it's not easy to make a diagnosis because doctors just think they have simple &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-47892500-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and give antibiotics, but those patients will not get better, they will get worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There is no proven cure for Valley Fever and patients are usually prescribed rest and given therapies to manage symptoms. Mild cases also tend to clear up on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe antifungal medications, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that show these treatments are effective - and antifungal drugs come with the potential for serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at Texas Tech Health, El Paso, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, El Paso has been experiencing frequent dust storms that have left residents battered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the region used to see about two to three dust days in the early months of the year, it has already recorded eight days of blowing dust this March alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The county was placed under a Weather Authority Alert last week after winds blew winds from 35 to 45 mph and gusts reached 65 mph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have since warned locals that these dust storms are much worse than previous years and can negatively impact their physical health as airborne particles can cause numerous illnesses including Valley Fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple local and federal agencies have asked El Paso residents to stay indoors and avoid traveling during these storms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her mother's death, Aide said she tries to ask every doctor and nurse practitioner she meets if they have heard of Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She claims that probably two out of three experts she encounters do not know about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aide said: 'It's just to spread awareness. Maybe somebody else doesn't have to go through what my mom did, all the experimenting, wondering if it's this or that. Maybe they can figure it out faster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That priority has fallen by the wayside in the second Trump administration, with the termination of a number of grants related to HIV in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most notable was the sudden withdrawal of $18 million per year for a program dedicated to understanding how to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV infections and AIDS in adolescents and young adults, who account for about &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-adolescents-and-young-adults#:~:text=Adolescents%20and%20young%20adults%20(AYA,get%20it%20through%20sexual%20transmission." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19% of new infections annually&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. On Friday, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention was notified that the two &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10993597#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10880572#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grants&lt;/a&gt; that support its operations had been halted by the National Institutes of Health, in a move that legal experts say may be found illegal if it were challenged in court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the loss of the program — during the third year of the seven-year grants — would mean ceasing research that could help expand the populations that might benefit from emerging treatments. The network has two ongoing trials studying a potential preventive &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20168%20HAPPY%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;treatment for HIV and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and assessing the effectiveness of sexual health counseling and behavioral therapy to &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20170%20IMPACT%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce HIV transmission in adolescents who use stimulants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

In case you’re not familiar, amyloid is found, but in the brain it clumps together to form "plaques" between nerve cells. Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-the-treatment-cure-alzheimers" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease.

(Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-this-treatment-be-available-to-the-public" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" target="_blank" title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-outlook-id="e969d9d8-afe5-4fde-99c7-3779cfebf110" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Randall J.

One of the medications in the treatment (gantenerumab) is no longer made. “The company developing it has decided to go into go in a different direction,” Dr. Sachdev says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Anti-amyloid medications also come with a high risk of side effects, including death—and that's concerning to many doctors and families, Dr. Segil says. “Like most neurologists in the U.S. today, we are not using this family of medications,” he says. “Clinical neurologists like me continue to be skeptical that the benefits outweigh the risks of anti-amyloid medications for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, they looked at people with a very high likelihood of developing it who were within 10 to 15 years before they were expected to develop the disease based on their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the treatment is more geared towards delaying or halting onset rather than curing an existing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are amyloid plaques and what do they do in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are areas where amyloid (again, a protein) has built up, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of it a lot like a scab on your skin,” he says. “The scab is rough, it isn't supposed to be there and, if it gets too thick, it causes a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is some debate about whether targeting amyloid will help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Targeting brain amyloid is not a slam dunk for Alzheimer’s prevention as we do not have any tests that are in use clinically to predict Alzheimer’s onset,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most neurologists liken [amyloid plaques] to skin freckles, which are normal aging phenomena and extremely infrequent[ly] became a skin cancer,” Dr. Segil continues. “Many Alzheimer’s scientists liken them to unexploded land mines which, if left alone, will cause older people to lose the ability to tie their shoes and all but surely get Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this treatment break down the amyloid plaques?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses anti-amyloid antibodies to break down the plaques, Dr. Sachdev explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anti-amyloid antibodies attach to amyloid and use the immune system to remove it,” he says. “This is very effective, because the immune system is excellent at getting rid of things that do not belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Sachdev also says that the drug relies on inflammation to clear the plaques. (Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randall J.

"Our trial tested this in rare families with mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease," Dr. Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial originally ended in 2020. Right now, there are ongoing trials that will wrap up in a few years, and if those are successful, the treatment could potentially be made available to the public, per Dr. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some doctors aren't convinced these treatments should be used. One of the medications in the treatment (gantenerumab) is no longer made. “The company developing it has decided to go into go in a different direction,” Dr. Sachdev says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-amyloid medications also come with a high risk of side effects, including death—and that's concerning to many doctors and families, Dr. Segil says. “Like most neurologists in the U.S. today, we are not using this family of medications,” he says. “Clinical neurologists like me continue to be skeptical that the benefits outweigh the risks of anti-amyloid medications for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQRDVWaHRPZTBmRjEydzN6WFJIQmhDS2xDYVNzU1BDZ1dReXhYTDBWWkNwX2tkWE56R2o0NEVLSnRzeHJTWVBibWF2X3JyazNPWmdNdU5mZW9yZmJEQkx0RWtzZXRaN2s4bnZjX1V4TTVmYm02Z0VqWTJyZngyRE5LWHNNbmVCVWptN0pr</guid></item><item><title>Could Salty Foods Be Fueling Depression Rates? - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE4tdGN4MnozZGlDMThMNHRQQWNsT2JTb0dpVUNMQXpPOHRDS3VkME5JektpMUVydzhuWmNvZG5lZ2dYRUpXbkdnZEpDU3pfRTBSVmpBYlFOSWYyVE5KTHI3WWxn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-salt diets triggered depression-like behaviors in mice by activating specific immune cells that produce the inflammatory molecule IL-17A.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When researchers removed these immune cells or used mice genetically unable to produce IL-17A, the depression-like behaviors didn’t occur despite high salt consumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While promising, this mouse study used extremely high salt levels, and more research is needed before applying these findings to human depression treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NANJING, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Too much salt has long been blamed for heart problems, but new research suggests it might harm our minds too. Scientists from Nanjing Medical University have discovered a surprising connection between high-salt diets and depression-like behaviors in mice, potentially explaining why depression rates continue rising alongside our consumption of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;excessive salt intake&lt;/a&gt; triggers specific immune responses in the brain that can lead to behaviors resembling depression. Their findings, published in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkaf019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offer a biological explanation for previously observed connections between processed food consumption and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide, with lifetime prevalence reaching 15-18% in many populations. Modern Western diets, especially fast food, contain dramatically more sodium than home-cooked meals—sometimes exceeding homemade options by 100-fold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-salt-depression-connection"&gt;The Salt-Depression Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice fed high-salt diets showed behaviors remarkably similar to those experiencing chronic stress. They explored less, displayed heightened &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and spent more time motionless during tests measuring “behavioral despair”—patterns that parallel human depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the biological mechanisms behind these behavioral changes. High-salt diets significantly increased production of Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an immune signaling molecule, particularly in specialized immune cells called gamma delta T cells (γδT cells).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research had linked elevated IL-17A to depression, but this study reveals a direct pathway from dietary salt to increased IL-17A production to depression-like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm this connection, the team tested mice genetically modified to lack the ability to produce IL-17A. These mice showed no signs of depression despite consuming high-salt diets. Even more convincingly, when researchers removed the specific immune cells that produce IL-17A, the animals no longer developed depression-like behaviors on high-salt &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-salt-diet-weakens-immune-system-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-humans"&gt;What This Means for Humans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conducted in mice, the research has compelling implications for human health. Population studies have already shown links between high-salt diets and increased depression rates. This study offers a potential explanation for those observations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/western-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;average American diet&lt;/a&gt; contains about 3,400 mg of sodium daily—far exceeding the American Heart Association’s recommended maximum of 2,300 mg. Fast food meals often deliver an entire day’s worth of recommended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sodium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; in a single sitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first research connecting diet and mental health. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diets&lt;/a&gt; rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins correlate with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-mediterranean-diet-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower depression rates&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, sugars, and unhealthy fats tend to increase depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinctive aspect of this study is identifying a specific biological pathway connecting diet directly to depression-like behaviors. This precision opens doors to potential new treatment approaches targeting the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-ways-to-reduce-salt-intake"&gt;Simple Ways To Reduce Salt Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current depression &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fish-oil-for-depression-stem-cell-study-shows-supplement-effective-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; typically focus on neurotransmitter imbalances using medications like SSRIs or on changing thought patterns through therapy. The discovery that dietary factors might contribute to depression through immune pathways represents an important shift in how we might approach mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applying these findings doesn’t necessarily require waiting for new pharmaceutical treatments. Simple dietary changes are accessible to most people:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing processed food intake&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eating more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/home-cooked-meals-healthy-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;home-cooked meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Checking food labels for sodium content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Using herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals already recommend the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dash-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) for patients with high blood pressure. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and reduced sodium. This new research hints such approaches might benefit mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual choices, these findings could influence public health policies around sodium reduction in processed foods. Some countries have already implemented such regulations: the United Kingdom’s salt reduction program has achieved a 15% decrease in average salt intake since implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed before definitive conclusions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;salt reduction&lt;/a&gt; as a depression treatment in humans, this study adds to mounting evidence that what we eat affects both body and mind. For those struggling with depression, these findings don’t suggest dietary changes should replace established treatments like therapy and medication, but they highlight diet as an important complementary factor in mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This research was conducted entirely in mice, not humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mouse depression models may not fully represent human depression’s complexity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The behavioral tests measure approximations of depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-extreme-salt-levels"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Salt Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study used extremely high salt concentrations (8% in food, 1% in water)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This far exceeds even high-sodium human diets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unclear if more moderate salt increases would produce similar effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-female-only-subjects"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female-Only Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only female mice were studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sex differences in immune response and depression are well-documented&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Results might differ in male subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-vs-causation-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation vs. Causation Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study shows a pathway but doesn’t prove this is the only mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other factors beyond IL-17A may contribute to depression in high-salt scenarios&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The relationship may be more complex in humans with varied diets and lifestyles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-application-hurdles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Application Hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence yet that reducing salt intake reverses depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No human clinical trials testing this specific mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unknown if targeting this pathway would be effective in humans already experiencing depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used female C57BL/6J mice aged 8-12 weeks, including normal mice and some genetically modified to lack RORγt (a protein necessary for IL-17A production). Researchers split the mice into groups receiving either normal diet (0.5% salt) or high-salt diet (8% salt in food plus 1% salt in drinking water) for 5-8 weeks. They also included a group subjected to chronic restraint stress (placed in a restrictive tube for 4 hours daily for 3 weeks) as a comparison model known to induce depression-like behavior. To assess depression-like behaviors, researchers employed four behavioral tests: the open field test (measuring exploration and anxiety), elevated plus-maze test (measuring anxiety), and tail suspension and forced swimming tests (both measuring “giving up” behaviors). They then examined tissues from blood, spleen, and brain using flow cytometry and microscopy to identify changes in immune cells and IL-17A production. In some experiments, they depleted specific immune cells (γδT cells) using antibodies to see if this would prevent depression-like behavior in mice eating high-salt diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice on high-salt diets developed significant depression-like behaviors comparable to those seen in chronically stressed mice. They showed reduced exploration in open spaces, increased anxiety behaviors, and greater immobility (a sign of “giving up”) in behavioral tests. These changes happened without affecting blood pressure, body weight, or food intake, suggesting the effects weren’t due to physical health problems. High-salt diet increased IL-17A production in the spleen, blood, and brain. Further analysis showed γδT cells (specifically a subset called γδT17 cells) were the main source of this increased IL-17A. When genetically modified mice unable to produce IL-17A were fed high-salt diets, they didn’t develop depression-like behaviors. Similarly, depleting γδT cells in normal mice using antibodies protected them from developing depression-like behaviors despite consuming high-salt diets. These results strongly suggest high-salt diets trigger depression-like behaviors through IL-17A production by γδT cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listed below are the date, times, and locations of the potential exposure sites associated with this case of measles:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 Train Southbound:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7:30 pm - 1:30 am&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Concourse, Union Station, 50 Massachusetts Ave NE, Washington, DC 20002
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;March 19, 11:00 pm - 1:30 am&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MedStar Urgent Care Adams Morgan, 1805 Columbia Rd NW, Washington, DC 20009
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;March 22nd, 7:00 pm - 11:00 pm&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, a runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough. These symptoms usually start 7 to 14 days after being exposed. The second stage starts 3 to 5 days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should you do if you were at one of the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People who might have been exposed and are not immune should contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652 for more guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anyone who was exposed and is at risk of developing measles should watch for symptoms until 21 days following the date of their last exposure. &lt;b&gt;If you notice the symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home and away from others.&lt;/b&gt; Contact your healthcare provider immediately. &lt;b&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/b&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the health department to help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve complete immunity, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have an immunocompromising condition, please consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. However, infants younger than 12 months of age are too young to be vaccinated. These infants, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to someone with measles. If you or your child have not yet been vaccinated, call DC Health or a healthcare provider to get the first of two doses as soon as possible. To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or contact DC Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers should maintain an increased index of suspicion for measles in clinically compatible cases at all times, especially if patients were recently exposed. Measles is an immediately reportable disease. Contact DC Health right away to report any suspected cases and arrange for public health testing. Suspected cases can be reported by healthcare providers via telephone at 844-493-2652 or by submitting a &lt;a href="https://dccovid.force.com/provider/s/login/?ec=302&amp;amp;startURL=%2Fprovider%2Fs%2F"&gt;Notifiable Disease and Condition Case Report Form online using the DC Reporting and Surveillance Center (DCRC), which can be found on our Infectious Diseases website &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these potential exposures, please contact DC Health at &lt;strong&gt;844-493-2652&lt;/strong&gt; or via email at &lt;a href="http://mailto:doh.epi@dc.gov"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1c5cec98fc4d1c8e1c5c28fc6ced7"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning! It was quite a rainy day in Boston yesterday — but at least it wasn’t a cold one. I’m manifesting some sun for today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-picks-a-new-cdc-director"&gt;Trump picks a new CDC director&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/13/trump-administration-withdraws-dave-weldon-cdc-nomination/"&gt;chaotic withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; of his first nominee to lead the CDC, President Trump has selected the agency’s acting director, Susan Monarez, to take the role, STAT’s Sarah Owermohle and Helen Branswell report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monarez is a longtime biosecurity expert with ties to former President Biden’s flagship health initiative, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. If confirmed, she’ll be the first CDC director since 1953 not to be a doctor of medicine. While she wasn’t well-known before the news dropped yesterday, some that did know her apparently referred to her as “the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-wolinetz-0631313_this-is-the-best-news-ive-had-the-privilege-activity-7018541444306976769-8ksK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kevin Bacon&lt;/a&gt; of biomedical innovation.” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/susan-monarez-trump-pick-cdc/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-the-kidney-transplant-system-need-to-change"&gt;Does the kidney transplant system need to change?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study says yes — if the wait list for a kidney transplant were expanded to improve access, fundamental changes to the current model would be required to reduce or even maintain existing wait times. While there are about 90,000 people on the waitlist at any given time, per &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal data&lt;/a&gt; from the fall, only about 25,000 kidney transplants take place each year. Adding 10% more patients to the waitlist would increase the average wait time by 4 months; adding 50% more patients would increase the time by almost two years. It would take an additional 2,800 kidneys to offset the 10% increase or 11,000 for a 50% increase, according to the analysis published yesterday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831868?guestAccessKey=45474923-36fb-4aa7-b7e0-15dd2eefd95f&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=032425" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, it’s especially difficult for people with kidney failure (the most sick patients) to get on the wait list for a transplant, and once there, it takes them &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/26/us/organ-transplants-waiting-list-skipped-patients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longer&lt;/a&gt; to actually get a new kidney. But it’s not just the extreme cases that would benefit from more kidneys and shorter wait times — that could save lives across the board. Overall, large increases in kidneys from living donors are likely needed, as are research and policy initiatives that would promote it, the authors wrote. (They did not discuss xenotransplantation, which has received a lot of attention but is still in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/united-therapeutics-xenotransplantation-clinical-trial/"&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of research.)  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nih-removes-outside-advisers-who-evaluate-research"&gt;NIH removes outside advisers who evaluate research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prominent outside scientists who help the NIH evaluate its internal research programs are being abruptly removed, according to five advisers whose positions were terminated and a recording of an internal meeting obtained by STAT’s Megan Molteni and Jason Mast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why this is happening. The advisers who spoke to STAT were not given a reason, and have yet to receive an official notification of termination from the NIH. “I asked where this order came from and nobody seemed to know,” one person said. Among those being terminated are people without U.S. citizenship, women, people from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and people who work in newly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/trump-dei-ban-banned-words-list-scrambles-research-nih-veterans-affairs/"&gt;taboo&lt;/a&gt; areas like diversity and equity. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/nih-outside-scientific-advisers-being-removed/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hong/AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past 35 years, the U.S. has built up systems to support people living with dementia and their caregivers — often through programs that rely on Medicaid funding. But the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed federal budget&lt;/a&gt; calls for $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years. If that happens, these programs that rely on Medicaid will likely need to reduce their services or potentially close down. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are afraid. I’m afraid. They are afraid of what will happen to them if they get this disease. They are even more afraid of how their families will cope,” Hilda Pridgeon, a founder of the Alzheimer’s Association, told Congress in 1990 while advocating for more support. In a new First Opinion essay, physician Jason Karlawish argues that this fear “will once again beset the American family” if the dramatic budget cuts are made. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/25/alzheimers-demetia-medicaid-services-support-pace-budget-cuts-caregivers/"&gt;Read the essay&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the stories of two patients from Karlawish’s memory clinic whose lives have been changed by Medicaid-funded programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-world-reduces-avoidable-deaths-amp-the-u-s-adds-them-study-says"&gt;The world reduces avoidable deaths &amp;amp; the U.S. adds them, study says&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most high-income countries around the world, the number of avoidable deaths (avoidable thanks to preventative measures or treatments) has been decreasing over the past decade. But in the U.S., that number is increasing, according to a study published yesterday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831735?guestAccessKey=6e140777-9347-46e6-bc5d-f78fca5cb2ee&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=032425" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2021, avoidable deaths in the U.S. increased from around 20 to 44 avoidable deaths per 100,000, the study found. The number of deaths increased in all 50 U.S. states, but the variation between each state also increased. Other countries saw about 14 fewer avoidable deaths per 100,000. In the European Union, the reduction was even greater, with an average of almost 24 fewer deaths per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. spends more on health care than every other high-income country, but the increase in avoidable deaths “suggests that there are concerning broad and systemic issues at play,” the study authors write. They write that policy solutions promoting healthy food, limiting exposure to harmful products, addressing gun violence, and regulating motor vehicle safety are potential ways to address the multifaceted problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy"&gt;23andMe files for bankruptcy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late on Sunday, the DNA-testing startup 23andMe said it will file for bankruptcy and CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki will depart, after she repeatedly tried and failed to take the storied but financially troubled company private, STAT’s Jason Mast &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-anne-wojcicki-resigns/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning. The company will now try to sell itself through a court-supervised sale, and Wojcicki will continue trying to buy it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand how it all happened, STAT’s Matthew Herper cites Ernest Hemingway’s description of bankruptcy in the 1926 novel, “The Sun Also Rises”: It happens “two ways: Gradually, and then suddenly.” Bankruptcy is the worst outcome for both Wojcicki and the company’s shareholders, Matt writes. But it’s the customers that may suffer the most.

Here’s what the research found, plus what your own pooping schedule suggests about your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Reports Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed bowel movement and health data from 1,400 healthy adults and put them into four groups:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipated: one to two BMs a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-normal: three to six BMs a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-normal: one to three BMs a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea: more than three bowel movements a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers looked at the link between pooping frequency and a person’s gut microbiome. The researchers discovered that people in the high-normal group had higher levels of “good” bacteria in their guts than those who pooped less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who were in the constipated group were more likely to have toxins in their blood that are linked to the development of serious conditions like kidney disease and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a60311866/why-its-so-important-to-detect-alzheimers-disease-early/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side, people in the diarrhea group also had markers of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can also raise the risk of developing certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that bowel movement frequency could be an important indicator of future health issues. Still, Gibbons says that bowel movement frequency doesn’t come up enough in regular doctor’s visits. “We’re trying to change that and push doctors more toward managing this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do doctors currently consider a “normal” pooping schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current definition of a “normal” pooping schedule is really broad. Doctors &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; say that pooping anywhere from three times a day to three times a week falls into a normal range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a really wide range,” Gibbons says. “We suspected that there was a narrower range that might be optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might pooping a lot be bad for your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that happen in your body when you poop a lot. “People who have diarrhea tend to have higher levels of inflammation,” Gibbons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation in the body is linked to a slew of serious health complications and diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and neurogenerative diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (NIEHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who poop a lot also had markers of liver stress. Gibbons says this “makes sense” given that the liver helps to produce bile, which is released into the intestines to break down fats and support digestion. “If we poop fast, we lose more of that bile, so it puts stress on our liver,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can pooping less be bad for you, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes down to what happens in your body before you poop. “Microbes in our guts prefer to ferment dietary fibers and turn them into organic acids,” Gibbons says. “They’re very good for our health and, if we’re under-exposed to them, we tend to have poorer outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if poop hangs out in your gut for too long, the microbes will eat any dietary fiber that’s there and then switch to protein fermentation, Gibbons says. “That leads to a bunch of toxic byproducts, and they have all been associated with chronic disease,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbons points out that this study found these toxic byproducts in the system of slower poopers, even if they weren’t classified as being constipated. “We suspect that being exposed to them for longer periods of time could increase your lifetime risk of various chronic diseases,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is every other day to two bowel movements a day good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has to do with the above—pooping every other day to twice a day puts you in a sweet spot of not going too often or too little, Gibbons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your pooping schedule tends to be a reflection of other things that are happening in your life, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bowel movements are often associated with a few features of a healthy lifestyle—greater amounts of vegetable and fruit intake, more exercise and more baseline daily activity, and good hydration,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein says that while your bowel movement frequency isn’t a traditional marker of health “it is becoming more apparent that gut health is critical to overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees. “It’s all about the gut microbiome,” he says. “It impacts the digestive system, brain health...various aspects of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to poop more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not pooping as much as you’d like, doctors recommend trying to do a few different things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going too little could be a sign that you are missing something—daily exercise, hydration, fiber from healthy plants and fruits,” Dr. Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors generally recommend that you see your healthcare provider when you have a change in your usual pooping habits. “If your frequency changes, if you have more than three bowel movements each day, if you have urgency or accidents or leakage, those are good reasons to check in with a provider,” Dr. Stein says. And, if you have any blood in your poop, she says that you shouldn’t hesitate to call your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have less than two bowel movements each week, or there is blood in the stool, weight loss, or you are straining a lot to get the stool out, talk with your physician about changes to your lifestyle and medications, and if you are in need for screening or evaluation for colon cancer,” Dr. Stein says. It’s also important to flag if you have a family history of Celiac disease or irritable bowel issues, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr. Bedford says it’s important to speak up if you’re dealing with uncomfortable symptoms linked to your pooping habits, like bloating, gas, and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re within the “normal” range of pooping, Gibbons says there’s no need to worry about your bowel habits, unless they suddenly change. But if you find that constipation or diarrhea is a common issue for you, it’s important to get it checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:28:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1JOHZhWjRCZ0dhNF9SekkxazNkR0IzbWRROGlpRG4yMEJkY1FBeVFQaGxZYmFab3FCbnBwSlFVN0V4MnZadkJrZ3Q4TnFDSlNpcGdTVzBPd0IyS09FbjRCWlJySzNKQmNjZWtuQjBqWW9uX2lBZ0E</guid></item><item><title>DC Health officials confirmed measles case in the District - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWnhSWl9ZMHZrTUZVUHBWc2RqWGZNcklvSF9pNUhYNHdYTW1fMnZHeERlanFucV9YNXo1alhoOUJRRnQyQW1nWjZvYU1iSllTeC1ZTmNmX1FZY28zazlvbEdKU1daS3g2TU9Vd3VMOEVONWxVYnhBdmFPS055NkJwTmR5UDJfLTJnVlBuMzczTkZ3TEky?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;The D.C.

                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health confirmed Tuesday a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified person traveled throughout the nation’s capital within the last week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential exposure sites outlined by the District’s health department include two Amtrak locations and an urgent care location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 Train Southbound
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Concourse, Union Station, 50 Massachusetts Ave, NE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MedStar Urgent Care Adams Morgan, 1805 Columbia Road, NW
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 22, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone not immune to measles and who traveled to the potential exposure sites during the noted dates and times are urged to contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Health’s alert comes weeks after health officials in Maryland confirmed three measles cases across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/measles-case-confirmed-in-howard-co-resident-who-passed-through-dulles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/03/2-more-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prince George’s&lt;/a&gt; counties. All three cases had been contracted by residents who had traveled abroad, and were not related to the outbreaks in New Mexico, Texas or Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details surrounding the latest confirmed measles case have not yet been provided. It remains unclear whether international travel is at all linked to the D.C. case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measles case was previously reported in the District in &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2024/07/single-case-of-measles-confirmed-in-dc-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="p1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the measles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air when an infected individual breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;More than often appearing in two stages, symptoms don’t typically begin to show until after the seventh day that the virus was contracted. Symptoms range from high fevers, runny nose, watery eyes to tiny white spots that appear in one’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the measles rash makes up the second stage of symptoms, appearing on the face along the  hairline before spreading throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC explainer&lt;/a&gt; indicates that “if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.” It notes the best protection against the virus is the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the system achieved 98% accuracy in differentiating between MSA and PSP, with diagnoses confirmed in about 94% of post-mortem brain analyses, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250318880785/en/JAMA-Neurology-publishes-landmark-study-showing-neuropacs-AI-technology-significantly-enhances-the-diagnostic-accuracy-of-Parkinsons-disease-and-atypical-parkinsonism"&gt;Neuropacs press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an important milestone for the parkinsonism community, including clinical providers and, most importantly, patients,” said David Vaillancourt, PhD, Neuropacs’ cofounder and chief scientific officer, a professor at the University of Florida, and the principal investigator of the study. The work was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We anticipate that the Neuropacs AI technology will revolutionize the current standard of care for diagnosing parkinsonism and will have far-reaching impacts on clinical care and clinical trial testing of new therapeutics,” Vaillancourt said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831631"&gt;Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms of atypical parkinsonism often similar to Parkinson’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/atypical-parkinsonism/"&gt;Atypical parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to conditions that cause symptoms closely resembling those of Parkinson’s — which can make a diagnosis challenging even for the most experienced clinician. It is estimated that as many as 45% of patients initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s are later found to have another type of parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, there is a need to develop clinical biomarkers that can help guide clinicians in reaching a more specific diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, scientists assessed Neuropacs’ AI technology in 249 patients at 21 &lt;a href="https://parkinson-study-group.org/"&gt;Parkinson Study Group&lt;/a&gt; centers — 19 in the U.S. and two in Canada. The patients had a mean age of 67.8, and were mainly men (62%). Based on a consensus clinical diagnosis from three independent neurologists, 99 patients in the study were diagnosed with Parkinson’s, 97 with PSP, and 53 with MSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, which captures images based on the movement of water molecules within tissues, was performed on patients and analyzed using Neuropacs’ AI software to predict each individual’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than three-quarters of the patients (78%) were placed in a training set to help the AI algorithm learn to differentiate between these types of conditions. The remaining 22% were assigned to a testing set to evaluate the model’s accuracy in diagnosing the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Patient autopsy data confirmed AI model diagnosis in 94% of cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, the model demonstrated a strong accuracy in distinguishing between different conditions, achieving accuracy of 96% in differentiating Parkinson’s from atypical parkinsonism. When distinguishing MSA from PSP, accuracy reached 98%. Similarly, it was 98% accurate in differentiating Parkinson’s from MSA and Parkinson’s from PSP, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers further confirmed the model predictions by analyzing brain tissue obtained from 49 patient autopsies, with about three years separating the last imaging scan and the individual’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis predicted by the AI model was confirmed in 46 of these patients (94%), including in all participants with Parkinson’s or MSA (five patients each), and 36 of 39 individuals with PSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represented a 12.3% gain in obtaining a correct diagnosis compared with a diagnosis based on clinical criteria, the researchers noted. Using clinical criteria, 82% of the patients were correctly diagnosed — four of five with Parkinson’s, three of five with MSA, and 33 of the 39 with PSP, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The age of using data-driven tools like AI to diagnose Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions has arrived. … As clinicians, we must embrace these technologies and start considering how we can best integrate them into routine workflows for neurological care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The findings highlight the transformative potential of this diagnostic software in clinical practice,” said Michael Okun, MD, codirector of the Norman Fixel Institute at the University of Florida, one of the sites that contributed to the study. Okun also serves as medical advisor for the &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/"&gt;Parkinson’s Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and is a member of Neuropacs’ clinical advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The age of using data-driven tools like AI to diagnose Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions has arrived,” Okun said. “As clinicians, we must embrace these technologies and start considering how we can best integrate them into routine workflows for neurological care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristophe Diaz, PhD, executive director and chief science officer of &lt;a href="https://www.psp.org/"&gt;CurePSP&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based nonprofit, noted that “proper diagnosis of PSP remains a critical need,” to ensure patients receive the correct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The results of this study are exciting progress [toward] a noninvasive and clinically scalable solution to help improve diagnosis,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers tracked rats’ hippocampal neuron activity for up to 20 hours and found that memory patterns first echoed the learning phase and then gradually shifted to match the recollection phase upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reorganization, observed during non-REM sleep, involved a dynamic change in the neurons representing reward locations—some stopped firing while others became active. These changes not only reinforced the memory but may also free up neurons for storing new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-REM Sleep Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory reactivation and optimization occurred during non-REM sleep, while REM sleep seemed to counteract this effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representational Drift:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuronal activity shifted from mimicking the learning phase to the recall phase, helping refine memory storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; After sleep, fewer neurons were involved in recalling reward locations, suggesting an optimization of memory representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep helps us remember recently learned information, ‘engraving’ our memories. This is also true for animals, as remembering for example the location of food resources is essential for their survival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists can examine this role of sleep in the lab by training lab mice or rats about their environment using various memory tasks. In such experiments designed for spatial learning, the animals must learn and subsequently remember the location of food rewards in mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research aimed at understanding the neuronal mechanisms that favor learning, memory formation, and recollection, many questions about these essential brain functions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from Professor Jozsef Csicsvari’s group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have probed the key roles of sleep stages in optimizing memory recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wirelessly measured neuronal activity patterns in rat brains for up to 20 hours of sleep, considerably extending previously reported measurement times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the neuronal assemblies in the early stages of sleep reflect recently learned spatial memories. However, as sleep progresses, neuronal activity patterns gradually transform into those seen later, when the rats awaken and remember the locations of their food rewards,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping—and remembering—reward locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past work showed that a cortical brain area called the hippocampus is important both for exploring and maintaining routes in an environment (called spatial navigation), and for spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal neurons keep track of the animal’s location by firing at specific locations, thus forming a cognitive map of the environment. Animals use this map to navigate in space while updating it during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this process, the reward locations play an instrumental role, becoming disproportionately represented on the animals’ cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following spatial learning, the hippocampus plays an important role in enhancing memory during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does so by reactivating recently learned memory traces. Previously, the Csicsvari group showed that the more often a specific reward location is reactivated during sleep, the better the animal remembered that location when they woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when the team blocked the reactivation of a specific reward memory, the animals were unable to recall the respective location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reorganizing neuronal patterns during sleep engraves memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists could so far only examine the reactivation of spatial memories in shorter sleep periods of two to four hours, the team now achieved such experiments during long overnight sleep. Using wireless recordings, they monitored neuronal activity in the hippocampus for up to 20 hours while the rats rested and slept after a spatial learning paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were unexpected. We showed that the activity patterns of neurons linked to the reward locations reorganized during the long sleep,” says ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann, one of the study’s co-first authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when a given reward location was reactivated, not all the neurons that represented that location remained active in the entire sleep. While some did—the ISTA researchers called them a “stable subgroup”—, others stopped firing during later sleep stages. But at the same time, a new group of neurons started to fire gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most surprisingly, we showed that while the pattern of firing neurons in the early stages of sleep echoed the neuronal activity in the learning phase, this pattern later evolved to mirror the neuronal activity when the rats woke up and remembered where the rewards were located,” adds Bollmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the team not only observed a drift in neuronal activity patterns during sleep in the frame of spatial learning but also linked it to the process of memory reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, they shed light on how sleep helps keep memories fresh. In addition, they showed that this reorganization happens during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, while REM sleep counteracts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeing neurons up for new memories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could be the role of this phenomenon—called “representational drift”—that occurs in sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only speculate in this regard,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible that memory representations must be formed quickly during learning but that such representations are not optimal for long-term storage. Therefore, a process may take place in sleep that optimizes these representations in sleep to reduce brain resources to store a specific memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this hypothesis, the researchers observed that fewer neurons were linked to a given reward location after sleep than before. Therefore, some neurons get freed up to take in newer memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any new memories must find a way to be integrated into existing knowledge. Frequent repetitions of the new memories as well as partial change in the neuronal code may thus help optimize their integration into existing memory representations,” concludes Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present research was conducted at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) by the recent ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann and former ISTA postdoc Peter Baracskay (co-first authors) together with former ISTA postdoc Federico Stella, currently an Assistant Professor at Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, The Netherlands, and ISTA Professor Jozsef Csicsvari (co-corresponding authors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbaaa5afb9aeaab8e5b9a4bfa3ae8ba2b8bfe5aaa8e5aabf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andreas Rothe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ist.ac.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andreas Rothe – IST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/a&gt;” by Jozsef Csicsvari et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal reactivation of waking neuronal assemblies in sleep is a key initial step of systems consolidation. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether reactivated assemblies are static or whether they reorganize gradually over prolonged sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tracked reactivated CA1 assembly patterns over ∼20 h of sleep/rest periods and related them to assemblies seen before or after in a spatial learning paradigm using rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that reactivated assembly patterns were gradually transformed and started to resemble those seen in the subsequent recall session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) had antagonistic roles: whereas NREM accelerated the assembly drift, REM countered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, only a subset of rate-changing pyramidal cells contributed to the drift, whereas stable-firing-rate cells maintained unaltered reactivation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that prolonged sleep promotes the spontaneous reorganization of spatial assemblies, which can contribute to daily cognitive map changes or encoding new learning situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAxd0Z6aC1QS1lGSlFDUkN2NFMyYXRjTk1zRUpCSXhVVzc3N19BeXpWWEtqMmZubVlFVFo2bUotb3UxaHZXcjRhS1dZZkZMa3ZYWFVBQjB1RFpwUHllc3JuYllaeU1wdUUyazlHVzl3</guid></item><item><title>On ‘Diabetes Alert Day,’ 80% of people unaware of condition that could help prevent serious health problems - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxOdTFtdEF2Z3J3YUFQeFZETV84eDBVcjg3NTBWSEsxVmg3VkdsSkFvOHJUNFdzSC1xNExDRnVDY2s0dkFmV3pZeEpzNHF3ODE1eWc5VXltaVUtOTJJQ1N2TlU5dF9QOXVpUjZwNE5qQ2V5Z2N3WU5qSF8xV25tTzRyT0ZtZS05bTNvSzdER2FObzFZWFpZZlNvS3g4My1yN0RUMm54Ql9vNFp2MDN2bGEyUlNZUzZzTUpObzV2X0dqcjVLVm44Z181S241dERIblFNdmxETldza1hCOFFa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March marks Diabetes Alert Day, a day meant to sound the alarm on the prevalence and risks linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a disease where a person’s body can’t regulate sugar properly. Over time it can lead to serious health complications, including heart attack, stroke, vision loss, kidney problems and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March is&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Diabetes Alert Day&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s several types of diabetes, but the most common one is Type 2 diabetes, which develops over time,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/kwameakoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Dr. Kwame Akoto&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente. As for what contributes to diabetes, the keys are aging, family history and genetics, diet and fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, as researchers have learned more about how diabetes progresses, as well as treatment and prevention, doctors have sought ways to prevent patients from developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, what we see is people go from normal sugars to what’s called prediabetes,” said Akoto. “And this is when your body starts to have those first triggers of sugar intolerance, and then the process worsens from there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the American Diabetes Association &lt;a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-extlink=""&gt;first introduced the diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; for prediabetes to determine the likelihood of someone developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, prediabetes has no symptoms,” said Akoto. “According to the CDC, about 38% of American adults — which is about 96 million people — have prediabetes, and we think about 80% don’t know that they have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District of Columbia, approximately 3,000 adults each year are diagnosed with diabetes, he said. In Maryland, approximately 28,000 receive the diagnose each year, and in Virginia, approximately 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How to identify prediabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In prediabetes, a person’s blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/prediabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. Preventive Task Force, which makes guidelines for us to implement screening with our patients, did recommend for adults between the ages of 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese should be screened at their visits,” said Akoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory screening involves a blood draw — including a fasting plasma glucose test, which measures blood sugar after an overnight fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one you’ll most likely see is called a Hemoglobin A1c test, which is a sugar average test that’s looking at your average sugar over eight to 12 weeks,” said Akoto. “That’s probably the one you’ll see most commonly used now, because it gives us so much information, instead of that spot test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lifestyle changes can prevent diabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a prediabetes diagnosis doesn’t mean a patient will develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes are really important,” said Akoto. “With controlling body weight, we do see research shows that 5% to 7% of body weight loss will reduce your risk of diabetes by 58%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding exercise activities such as walking, using a treadmill, bike riding or resistance training is important in heading off diabetes. “We recommend 150 minutes a week, split up any way that you like,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet should include more fruits and vegetables, said Akoto. “These are high fiber foods that slow down how the sugar absorbs in our gut. Lean proteins also have the same effect, so incorporate things like fish, or turkey or chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente operates a yearlong &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/article/diabetes-prevention-program-2406305" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Diabetes Prevention Program&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to lower the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in participants.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional brain scans taken during rest, this immersive approach revealed distinct patterns of neural communication in ADHD, especially in deeper brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that ADHD-related brain differences become more visible during real-world-like interactions, highlighting the need for more dynamic diagnostic methods. These findings could pave the way for improved diagnostics and non-drug treatments using gamified tools and real-time brain tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VR Brain Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-related brain differences were only apparent during active virtual gameplay, not rest or passive video viewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-Regional Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found altered communication between deep brain structures and cortical areas in children with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Results suggest ADHD diagnostics and research should involve real-world tasks to better capture symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aalto University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a novel study, researchers from several European universities used Virtual Reality gaming to study brain network activity in children with clinically diagnosed ADHD. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, ADHD in both children and adults has primarily been studied using brain imaging in a resting state, rather than while actively engaging in tasks where overt symptoms are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Taking pictures of the brain while memory and attention are being loaded in a virtual world gives us a deeper understanding of what’s going on,’ explains Juha Salmitaival (aka Salmi), visiting professor at Aalto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108229"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child in a VR headset and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Similarly, the virtual world contains toys that can trigger impulsivity, like musical instruments, a soft drink in the fridge or the chance to take a virtual shower. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘During the virtual reality game, there were clear differences in brain network activation for kids with ADHD, particularly in the deep structures of the brain and their connection to cortical areas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, subjects were immersed in a world of challenges mimicking those faced by people in the real world. The game was projected onto a mirror, allowing children to play whilst their brain activity was scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were then compared with scans taken while they were doing more passive activities like watching a video or simply resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Interestingly, while at rest, there was no detectable difference between the groups, and there was little difference during video viewing,’ says Salmi, findings which also highlight the value of this novel way of collecting neuroimaging data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We used to think that abnormal development is mostly a matter of background activity in specific, limited brain regions. But these findings indicate that it’s more to do with inter-regional communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We found that alterations in brain activity in individuals with ADHD are driven by the human-environment interaction,’ says Salmi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that psychological testing for ADHD in the clinic, or even just brain imaging research more generally, should take place in situations where the individual is actually doing something that would spark symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi hopes the study will spark more extensive research, believing that this method could also help us find out what’s behind the sharp rise in ADHD diagnoses and in the development of non-pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games and apps are changing our brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not lost on the researchers that gaming in a virtual environment is an excellent way to explore what’s going on in our brains in a world of screens and social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The brain is a complex system that always tries to adapt to its environment, therefore it’s likely being shaped by TikTok, Snapchat and other apps and games as well,’ says Salmi. Similarly, the virtual world contains toys that can trigger impulsivity, like musical instruments, a soft drink in the fridge or the chance to take a virtual shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘If the environment is fast paced, with people jumping from one thing to another like a grasshopper, the brain tries to get better at jumping from one stimulus to another,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘But if we become grasshoppers, we can no longer concentrate for two hours when there are very few stimuli. Scanning the brain while it’s active could also give us fresh insight into how our brains are changing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies for the team include researching children’s brains using smart suits and motion sensors, as well as exploring symptoms in adults in set ups that more closely simulate daily life. He foresees that in the future, symptoms could also be quantified at home, for example using augmented reality glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi also points out that while fMRI is at this stage too costly to be used for mainstream diagnostic purposes, as we build more knowledge in this way, diagnosing neuropsychiatric conditions should also become more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Aalto researchers, the study involved researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the University of Oulu and the Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre in France. The virtual game, Epeli was developed by a Finnish company called Peili Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99eaf8ebf8f1b7f1ecfdeaf6f7d9f8f8f5edf6b7fff0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sarah Hudson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aalto.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aalto University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sarah Hudson – Aalto University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Real-world goal-directed behavior reveals aberrant functional brain connectivity in children with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;” by Juha Salmitaival et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-world goal-directed behavior reveals aberrant functional brain connectivity in children with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectomics is a popular approach to investigate the neural underpinnings of developmental disorders of which attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, neuronal mechanisms driving the aberrant functional connectivity resulting in ADHD symptoms remain largely unclear. Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:23:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1TTmRrSXVnRW1uT2pUblhSblJEUUFSWmdhd2NpVWpQRVNIOXMxX2VNcnZaQXU5Z1JadkRSMC1kLS1pMTRRX1dPT2ZEcU9qbjc2d2JaNU1MaTR3ZU1xUTNGSUJfWU90c0ljY2tCVw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover How To Flip the Immune “Switch” Against Alzheimer’s Disease - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:12:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw</guid></item><item><title>What I’ve learned from my aunt, who has secondary progressive MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOWUpLRnhUS3hhVTkxV1AwVTdEYzBfNjNjTGtLUVFxa09UczRxRTl5eWdPeUc5MVF3QUNpYWJJR1piZHR0Y2pLQXJhaXFsdUljYU8wZnZ6MXhzUDdyd0xqOXdFUUFpSExtamVHQlQwcnVQMVFLM3VtV3dWTGFuZW9kYXFkYVVDeFdKTDlQanZCWHEyQTFJQkR0aFdfTWZmT3JtZURmRmx4dVJUUkRnSElJTjVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 25 of 31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Chris Delemater’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it like to know someone with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS)? Have I learned anything from someone who has it? In fact, my aunt, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/silver-linings-jennifer-powell/"&gt;Jenn Powell&lt;/a&gt;, who is the brand and marketing manager at &lt;a href="https://bionews.com/"&gt;Bionews&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of this website, has &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; — and she is one of the most influential people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class="bio-article-image"&gt;
			&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-146285 size-medium" src="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image2-380x259.jpeg" alt="A young woman stands in a kitchen holding a newborn baby boy.

									&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from an early age that she had a lifelong illness, but only more recently did I come to understand the often grim reality that MS can cause. That said, my aunt has been an absolute &lt;em&gt;champion&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to dealing with her condition. Not only is she physically strong enough to get through the near-constant pain, but she also has the mental fortitude to wake up every day and go on with life without being bogged down by fear or doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t allow the knowledge that her MS will eventually progress to bring her down, and she lives her life to its fullest. In my opinion, her reality with MS has made her more appreciative of every day she has lived and breathed on this planet than anyone else I know. In turn, she has lived a more rich and fulfilling life than she otherwise might have if she never had MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her own amazing way, she has turned what may seem to everyone else to be a curse into a true blessing. I aspire to apply this same attitude to my own lifelong condition of Asperger’s syndrome/autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although MS and Asperger’s syndrome/autism are vastly different, the way we must deal with them is rather similar. The knowledge that I will never quite fit in with everyone else, that my brain is biologically wired differently, and the chronic life-shortening stress I go through is a tough pill to swallow at times.&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in difficult times, I like to apply my aunt’s perspective to my own issues. Instead of dwelling on the negative aspects of my diagnosis, I focus instead on all of the good things it has brought me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hyperawareness of certain stimuli — sights, smells, sounds, and the like — allows me to live a rich and beautiful life, with a vast library of vivid memories and an appreciation of all the experiences that have led to this moment. The gift of my vivid imagination has given me a love of fantasy literature and writing. Being able to write this Community Spotlight piece is another reminder that my diagnosis can be viewed as a gift, not simply a mental disability, like so many others see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my Aunt Jenn’s way of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;living with MS&lt;/a&gt; has taught me much about my lifelong struggle with Asperger’s syndrome/autism and has brought me a new sense of gratitude. With the right perspective, MS and Asperger’s can both be viewed as gifts rather than curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Chris Delemater’s aunt Jenn Powell is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the brand and marketing manager for Bionews, the parent company of Multiple Sclerosis News Today, and also hosts a podcast and wrote &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/silver-linings-jennifer-powell/"&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt; for the site. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s been hard to tell if the bowel movement issues came first or if the diseases caused them, given that the studies were in people who were already sick, says &lt;a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean M.

The researchers discovered that people in the high-normal group had higher levels of “good” bacteria in their guts than those who pooped less often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But people who were in the constipated group were more likely to have toxins in their blood that are linked to the development of serious conditions like kidney disease and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a60311866/why-its-so-important-to-detect-alzheimers-disease-early/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a60311866/why-its-so-important-to-detect-alzheimers-disease-early/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s disease" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side, people in the diarrhea group also had markers of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can also raise the risk of developing certain diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that bowel movement frequency could be an important indicator of future health issues. Still, Gibbons says that bowel movement frequency doesn’t come up enough in regular doctor’s visits. “We’re trying to change that and push doctors more toward managing this,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-doctors-currently-consider-a-normal-pooping-schedule" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What do doctors currently consider a “normal” pooping schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The current definition of a “normal” pooping schedule is really broad. Doctors &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="generally" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; say that pooping anywhere from three times a day to three times a week falls into a normal range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“That’s a really wide range,” Gibbons says. “We suspected that there was a narrower range that might be optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-pooping-a-lot-be-bad-for-your-health" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Why might pooping a lot be bad for your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things that happen in your body when you poop a lot. “People who have diarrhea tend to have higher levels of inflammation,” Gibbons says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Chronic inflammation in the body is linked to a slew of serious health complications and diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and neurogenerative diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (NIEHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But people who poop a lot also had markers of liver stress. Gibbons says this “makes sense” given that the liver helps to produce bile, which is released into the intestines to break down fats and support digestion. “If we poop fast, we lose more of that bile, so it puts stress on our liver,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-can-pooping-less-be-bad-for-you-too" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Why can pooping less be bad for you, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It comes down to what happens in your body before you poop. “Microbes in our guts prefer to ferment dietary fibers and turn them into organic acids,” Gibbons says. “They’re very good for our health and, if we’re under-exposed to them, we tend to have poorer outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But if poop hangs out in your gut for too long, the microbes will eat any dietary fiber that’s there and then switch to protein fermentation, Gibbons says. “That leads to a bunch of toxic byproducts, and they have all been associated with chronic disease,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Gibbons points out that this study found these toxic byproducts in the system of slower poopers, even if they weren’t classified as being constipated. “We suspect that being exposed to them for longer periods of time could increase your lifetime risk of various chronic diseases,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

twice a day puts you in a sweet spot of not going too often or too little, Gibbons says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But your pooping schedule tends to be a reflection of other things that are happening in your life, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" target="_blank"

class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Ellen Stein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Bowel movements are often associated with a few features of a healthy lifestyle—greater amounts of vegetable and fruit intake, more exercise and more baseline daily activity, and good hydration,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Stein says that while your bowel movement frequency isn’t a traditional marker of health “it is becoming more apparent that gut health is critical to overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" target="_blank"

data-node-id="29.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees. “It’s all about the gut microbiome,” he says. “It impacts the digestive system, brain health...various aspects of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-poop-more" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-w63prd

much as you’d like, doctors recommend trying to do a few different things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Going too little could be a sign that you are missing something—daily exercise, hydration, fiber from healthy plants and fruits,” Dr. Stein says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-to-see-a-doctor" data-node-id="34" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Doctors generally recommend that you see your healthcare provider when you have a change in your usual pooping habits. “If your frequency changes, if you have more than three bowel movements each day, if you have urgency or accidents or leakage, those are good reasons to check in with a provider,” Dr. Stein says. And, if you have any blood in your poop, she says that you shouldn’t hesitate to call your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If you have less than two bowel movements each week, or there is blood in the stool, weight loss, or you are straining a lot to get the stool out, talk with your physician about changes to your lifestyle and medications, and if you are in need for screening or evaluation for colon cancer,” Dr. Stein says. It’s also important to flag if you have a family history of Celiac disease or irritable bowel issues, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Finally, Dr. Bedford says it’s important to speak up if you’re dealing with uncomfortable symptoms linked to your pooping habits, like bloating, gas, and stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you’re within the “normal” range of pooping, Gibbons says there’s no need to worry about your bowel habits, unless they suddenly change. But if you find that constipation or diarrhea is a common issue for you, it’s important to get it checked out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention Magazine</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 12:34:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPWTZ4dVU4ZjBQREItb2FZc0VmUEUyMV8weXNMUU00RGxpQVctbkZVNWdjSlozZU1SNVZxLXpiYnNuR2JJNXdwZFFoQVgxbk1GRUJHMGRnWWRRMmFULTRoMllRWHloOHoyLTRGcmlJck5xSF9ZaEVqc0JjRENvZXNLRG9jZk5oQ3pfLVdBcm5vR3VqRm16V1E</guid></item><item><title>Tuberculosis cases continue to increase in San Diego County - The San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPSC1KNFZQOUgtN2h6TWVrb1dBYndxX2RtcUE4cXk2cGFlV0Z5Q3RaaU40ZHZPOE5LejVpelo2MVJlVElKZG95NWxnTjFtUVIxdXFVZUV4N1hhbzVkeGs5VTRsWlgxM0tDRmYySXFWUHh5eHlGU1BHWFVvT0F6aWo5Q0c4QW54WW1DTERaM1NFc0NBUnN6UXlnOWYyRkFtR3hLUllXMnNGMGM2U2pj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday was &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-raises-awareness-ahead-of-world-tuberculosis-day/"&gt;World Tuberculosis Day&lt;/a&gt; and, as usual, Americans had reason to celebrate, with incidence &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/indicators/i/13B4226/C288D13"&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; that are among the best anywhere, according to the World Health Organization. But that does not mean there is not room for further improvement, especially in San Diego County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-raises-awareness-ahead-of-world-tuberculosis-day/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; calling for greater tuberculosis awareness, the San Diego County health department indicates that the region had 7.5 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 residents in 2024, a rate that is more than double the national rate of 3 per 100,000 and 5.4 per 100,000 in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the most recent country-by-country data is from 2022, it shows that the average rate across the globe is 134 cases per 100,000 residents with countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mongolia and the Philippines listed as having some of the highest rates globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though local numbers, compared to other commonly tracked infectious diseases such as the flu and coronavirus, are small, TB is nonetheless on a continued rise in San Diego County and in most locations nationwide. San Diego tallied 247 total cases in 2024 compared with 243 in 2023. While it is the fourth consecutive annual increase, local totals have not yet reached the recent high of 264 cases recorded in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was the case for most infectious diseases, tuberculosis cases fell in 2020, reaching 193 in a year characterized by a wide-ranging stay-at-home order and other transmission-reducing practices put in place in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while TB numbers have continued to rise since the pandemic, they have not yet fully regained the heights reached in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While case numbers do not yet show a larger problem than existed before the pandemic, the trend is headed in the wrong direction, especially since the county has been engaged in a tuberculosis elimination &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/tuberculosis_control_program/tbei.html"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the flu or COVID-19, tuberculosis has a long lead time. The bacteria that causes the disease can live in the human respiratory tract for many years, or even decades, before becoming active, invading the bloodstream and causing deadly illness. About 175,000 people who live in San Diego County are estimated to be carrying “latent” infections, which are in a sort of dormancy and do not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to winning the tuberculosis fight, then, is detecting and eliminating latent infections before they become active and gain the ability to spread from person to person through tiny water droplets shed through everyday activities such as coughing, speaking or singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Percak, medical director and chief of the county’s Tuberculosis Control Program, said that the organization’s main TB clinic and associated health centers screened about 4,000 local residents for TB infection in 2024 with about 800 of those initial tests coming back positive. The number was similar, he said, in 2023, and no data was available on what percentage of those who tested positive took the antibiotics necessary to eliminate latent infections. Those numbers, though, do not include testing and treatment performed by private health care organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway with a wide range of medical providers to better understand treatment rates in order to determine what percentage of those who are screened and found to have an infection make it all the way to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have started collecting that data so that we’re able to look at it as a proportion of people achieving all of the steps that would be needed to lead to the outcomes that we’re looking for,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that San Diego County has a higher-than-average per-capita level of TB activity? TB rates are known and observed to be higher in places with higher proportions of residents who travel internationally, especially to countries where the disease is much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A majority are born outside the United States, and that reflects a combination of the likelihood of having been exposed previously in life but also reflects an intersection of social determinants of health like language barriers, health literacy, access to care, education and housing,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic health conditions such as HIV, diabetes or other immune system problems increase risk as does smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with chronic conditions who were born outside the United States are at the top of the list of people who should get tested. One common misconception, Percak said, is that the cases that pop up each year are among recent immigrants. However, that’s not true. He said that because TB can take so long to become active, cases are most often among those who have been around for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The overwhelming majority of people who are diagnosed with TB who are born outside the United States are not recently arrived,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are people who are long-standing parts of our community, who have been here for many years or decades before they become sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big part of the fight toward TB elimination is around getting those who do test positive to follow through with antibiotic treatment. In the past, such treatment took many months to complete and involved antibiotics with a significant impact on liver health. However, a new crop of medications significantly reduces those burdens, making the process easier and more comfortable to undergo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those without health insurance can call the county’s TB clinic at 858-573-7300 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

This could even extend to forgetting the purpose of everyday objects, such as a toaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T MISS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Along with losing the ability to communicate clearly, they may also eventually lose the skills to use everyday objects such as cutlery, toothbrushes or doors," warns the charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language impairment might also manifest in other ways, like shortening sentences during conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone with frontotemporal dementia might say, "I... walking... shop" instead of saying that they are walking to the shop.

					&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The battle against Alzheimer’s disease continues to challenge medical researchers worldwide, but a simple fermented milk drink might offer unexpected benefits for those affected by this devastating condition. New research from Brazil has identified promising cognitive improvements linked to regular consumption of kefir, a tangy probiotic-rich beverage with origins in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The growing Alzheimer’s crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/03/19/the-7-stages-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; currently affects approximately 7 million Americans, with that number expected to nearly double within the next 25 years. As the most common form of dementia, it progressively destroys memory and cognitive function, leaving patients increasingly dependent on caregivers and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The condition places enormous emotional and financial strain on families and healthcare systems. With limited pharmaceutical options available and no cure on the horizon, researchers are increasingly exploring alternative approaches to managing symptoms and potentially slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;This search has led scientists to investigate an unexpected ally in cognitive health—the trillions of microorganisms residing in our digestive systems. Growing evidence suggests that these gut microbes may influence brain function through what researchers call the “gut-brain axis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The gut-brain connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Recent neuroscience research has revealed a complex communication network between our digestive system and brain. This bidirectional relationship means that the health of our gut microbiome can potentially impact &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/02/27/dementia-and-its-impact-on-cognitive/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; function and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The microorganisms in our intestinal tract produce various compounds that can enter the bloodstream and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier. Some of these bacterial metabolites have anti-inflammatory properties that might protect against neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Imbalances in gut bacteria have been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. This inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Probiotics—beneficial bacteria found in fermented foods—may help restore a healthy balance of gut microorganisms and reduce this inflammation. Kefir stands out among probiotic foods due to its exceptionally diverse microbial content, containing both beneficial bacteria and yeasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;What makes kefir special?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Kefir is produced by fermenting milk with kefir grains—small, cauliflower-like structures containing a complex community of beneficial microorganisms. Unlike &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/02/20/why-greek-yogurt-is-taking-over/"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, which typically contains only a few bacterial strains, kefir hosts dozens of different probiotic species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The fermentation process creates a tangy, slightly effervescent beverage with a consistency between milk and yogurt. Beyond its probiotic content, kefir provides protein, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B12, and other nutrients important for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Traditional kefir originated in the Caucasus Mountains, where locals discovered that adding kefir grains to milk created a beverage that would stay fresh longer. They attributed exceptional longevity in the region partly to regular kefir consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Modern commercial varieties are widely available in supermarkets, though traditional homemade kefir maintains a more diverse microbial profile. The drink has gained popularity worldwide as interest in gut health and fermented foods has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The promising research findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Brazilian scientists conducted a comprehensive review analyzing seven studies on kefir’s effects on Alzheimer’s symptoms. While most involved animal subjects, one notable human trial produced particularly encouraging results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;In this small human study, 13 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer’s consumed kefir daily for 90 days. Researchers administered 2 milliliters of kefir per kilogram of body weight—equivalent to about one cup daily for an average adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The results were remarkable. After the three-month period, participants demonstrated a 28% improvement in overall cognitive functioning as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, a standard assessment tool for dementia. Even more impressive, memory test scores improved by 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;These cognitive improvements corresponded with positive changes in biological markers. Participants showed reduced levels of inflammatory compounds and oxidative stress indicators in their blood, suggesting that kefir might address some of the underlying physiological processes involved in Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Animal studies reinforce the findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Supporting evidence comes from laboratory research involving rodents and even fruit flies, which are often used as simplified models for studying brain disorders. These animal studies provide insights into the potential mechanisms behind kefir’s beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="[&amp;amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-decimal space-y-1.5 pl-7"&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Rodent experiments demonstrated that kefir consumption reduced neuroinflammation—the chronic inflammation in brain tissue that contributes to neuron damage in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Kefir appeared to downregulate the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a cellular pathway involved in triggering inflammatory responses in the brain. Excessive TLR4 activation has been implicated in various neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Studies with fruit flies showed that kefir supplementation reduced the accumulation of amyloid plaques—abnormal protein deposits that characterize Alzheimer’s disease and interfere with neuron communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Both rodent and fruit fly research indicated improvements in motor coordination and physical capabilities following kefir consumption, suggesting benefits beyond cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Multiple animal studies noted decreases in oxidative stress markers after kefir supplementation. Oxidative stress, which involves damage from unstable molecules called free radicals, is believed to contribute significantly to brain cell deterioration in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Expert perspectives on the findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Dr. Peter Gliebus, who directs the cognitive and behavioral neurology program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, finds the biological rationale for kefir’s benefits compelling but emphasizes the preliminary nature of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;“The concept makes sense from what we understand about the gut-brain axis,” he explains. “Kefir may help restore a balanced gut microbiome and reduce systemic inflammation, which could potentially limit inflammation in the brain tissue. However, we need larger, more rigorous clinical trials before recommending specific probiotics as standard treatment for Alzheimer’s patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist specializing in brain health, agrees with this cautious approach while acknowledging the promise of dietary interventions like kefir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;“These early studies are encouraging, but still in initial stages,” Salinas notes. “What’s particularly interesting is how these findings align with growing evidence supporting the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, which incorporates fermented foods among other brain-healthy components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Both experts emphasize that managing Alzheimer’s requires a comprehensive approach. While dietary factors like kefir consumption may play a supportive role, they should complement established interventions such as regular physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, social engagement, and medical management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Practical considerations for kefir consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;For those interested in adding kefir to their diet, several considerations may help maximize potential benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Traditional kefir typically contains a more diverse microbial population than commercial varieties, though both contain beneficial probiotics. Those making kefir at home should follow proper food safety practices to avoid contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Commercial kefir products vary significantly in sugar content. Choosing plain, unsweetened versions and adding fresh fruit for flavor provides probiotics without excessive added sugars, which some research suggests may contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Individuals with lactose intolerance often tolerate kefir better than other dairy products because the fermentation process breaks down much of the lactose. However, completely lactose-free and non-dairy alternatives made from coconut water or plant milks are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The optimal dosage remains unclear based on current research. The human study mentioned earlier used approximately one cup daily for an average adult, but future research may refine these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;As with any dietary supplement, individuals taking medications or with existing health conditions should consult healthcare providers before making significant changes to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The future of kefir research for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While current findings offer reason for optimism, researchers emphasize that larger clinical trials with more participants and longer duration are essential next steps. Future studies will need to address several important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;What specific kefir components or microbial strains provide the most significant cognitive benefits? Different kefir varieties contain varying bacterial and yeast populations that may influence effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;At what stage of Alzheimer’s development might kefir consumption be most beneficial? Early intervention could potentially yield greater results than beginning supplementation after significant cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;How does kefir compare or interact with established Alzheimer’s medications? Understanding these relationships could help optimize treatment protocols that combine dietary approaches with pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Are certain populations more likely to benefit from kefir consumption based on genetic factors, existing gut microbiome composition, or other variables? Personalized approaches might eventually enhance effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;What is the optimal dosage and duration for maximum cognitive benefits? The amount used in the initial human study provides a starting point, but refinement through additional research could improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;A cautiously optimistic outlook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While kefir shows genuine promise as a complementary approach to Alzheimer’s management, medical experts advise maintaining realistic expectations. No single intervention—dietary, pharmaceutical, or otherwise—is likely to provide a complete solution for this complex neurological condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The most encouraging aspect of this research may be how it highlights the potential benefits of readily available, natural foods in supporting brain health. Unlike experimental drugs that may take decades to develop and approve, fermented foods like kefir are already accessible to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;For individuals concerned about brain health or those with family histories of dementia, incorporating fermented foods into a balanced diet represents a low-risk strategy that aligns with general wellness recommendations. Beyond potential cognitive benefits, these foods support overall digestive health and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;As research into the gut-brain connection continues to evolve, kefir and similar &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;probiotic-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; may become increasingly important components of both preventative strategies and complementary treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. While not a miracle cure, this ancient fermented beverage offers a promising avenue for further exploration in our quest to combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the kind of pain that takes your breath away. The bleeding was so severe that she went through a maxi pad every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two decades later, at age 38, she had another period that “felt like having your intestines grabbed and squeezed on the inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called her gynecologist, and recalls that a nurse told her it was “just a bad period.” As the pain and abnormal bleeding raged on, she called again and was told to come in for an appointment the following week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like this is where everything went downhill,” Adams, now 46, says. At her appointment, she found out she was having a miscarriage. She didn't know she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miscarriage, she suspects, escalated the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/08/19/what-helps-with-period-cramps/74639317007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heavy and painful periods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heavy and painful periods&lt;/a&gt; she had experienced since her first menstruation. When she expressed this to her doctor, it was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But three years into a new relationship, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/09/17/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-shortage/74529722007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:she began bleeding after sex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;she began bleeding after sex&lt;/a&gt;. Then, she bled all the time. She struggled to go to work, where she was a teacher for people with severe disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pain was so bad, I couldn't breathe, I was crying," she says. She was taking the maximum doses of Advil and Tylenol every day "and it didn’t even touch the pain,” she remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her doctor retired, she found a new doctor who ordered tests to assess her abnormal uterine bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams was finally diagnosed in 2023 with adenomyosis, a gynecological condition once thought to impact only 1-5% of women, but recent estimates suggest it likely affects &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539868/#:~:text=Accurate%20demographics%20and%20disease%20prevalence,more%20insight%20about%20affected%20populations." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at least 1 in 5 women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;at least 1 in 5 women&lt;/a&gt;.

Adams had never heard of the condition before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Common conditions in men and women, like cancer, diabetes or hypertension, get a lot of attention, but things like adenomyosis do not,” says Danilyants, who specializes in complex gynecological conditions. “Patients don’t know about it. The OBGYNs maybe know about it, but don't educate the patients. This leads to delay in care and underdiagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kristina Adams says the doctor who diagnosed her with adenomyosis "saved her life."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is adenomyosis? Symptoms, causes explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus, called endometrial tissue, grows into the uterine wall. It can cause the uterus to double or triple in size, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/04/18/period-flu-ill-nauseous-before-menstruation/7275020001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:painful menstrual cramps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;painful menstrual cramps&lt;/a&gt; (dysmenorrhea) and heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include irregular periods, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, bloating (nicknamed "adenomyosis belly") and infertility. The abnormal bleeding can increase a person’s risk of anemia and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adenomyosis has related symptoms but is distinct from &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/11/19/florence-pugh-endometriosis-pcos-egg-freezing/76429194007/#:~:text=Endometriosis%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20is%20a%20condition,Fertility%20problems%20also%20may%20develop.%22" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:endometriosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, in which endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRIs are more likely than ultrasounds to pick up adenomyosis, but insurance doesn't always approve them and it can cost patients thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. Danilyants says even when adenomyosis markers are found, doctors don't always take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes patients come in with a copy of their ultrasound or MRI, and on that report, there are findings suspicious of adenomyosis, and the patient didn’t even realize because the OBGYN never highlighted it as a significant finding,” Danilyants explains. “So there’s already the diagnosis, but still no one’s stressed that that’s the cause of the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of adenomyosis is unknown, but Danilyants says risk factors include being in your 40s and having a history of multiple C-sections. Childbirth, prior uterine surgeries, such as a uterine fibroid removal or a dilation and curettage (D&amp;amp;C), and a history of endometriosis are also risk factors, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14167-adenomyosis#symptoms-and-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication can help manage pain, but the only way to fully stop adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. Most insurances cover a hysterectomy for adenomyosis if it is deemed medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery is a big decision, but Danilyants says a vaginal or laparoscopy hysterectomy done by a specialist is a &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/obgyn/minimally-invasive-gynecologic-surgery/hysterectomy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:minimally invasive procedure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;minimally invasive procedure&lt;/a&gt; that takes only 45 minutes under general anesthesia. Within 7 days, Danilyants says her patients can return to work. Recovery can look different for everyone, but typically takes 2-4 weeks, shorter than the 6-8 weeks for abdominal hysterectomies, &lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medical-resources/laparoscopic-hysterectomy#:~:text=For%20most%20women%2C%20recovery%20after,than%20remain%20in%20the%20hospital." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Brigham and Women's Hospital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to Brigham and Women's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/hysterectomy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I was very in the dark' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/10/pmdd-hormonal-disorder-women-mental-health/75585063007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PMDD can be deadly but many women go undiagnosed for decades;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PMDD can be deadly but many women go undiagnosed for decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;She lost her job due to untreated adenomyosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Adams’ symptoms escalated, the school day she once looked forward to became increasingly challenging to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctor advised her to get a hysterectomy, and in 2024, she joked to her students that she was going away to get “old woman surgery.” But on the backend, she was pleading her case to human resources. She had run out of sick days. She couldn’t afford her bills and was living off credit cards. At the end of the school year, she left her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teaching gave me purpose, it was my identity,” she says. “Adenomyosis has gotten into all aspects of my life. My career, my relationships, my lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kristina Adams before her hysterectomy on October 27, 2024. She was diagnosed in summer 2023 after suffering for 20 years.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Women may self-advocate, but patient neglect can delay care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams is not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristina Poffenroth, 35, had heavy periods starting in junior high, and was put on various forms of birth control for 20 years. After switching from oral contraception to an &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/24/women-birth-control-iud-pain-cdc/75805591007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:intrauterine device;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;intrauterine device&lt;/a&gt; (IUD) in 2016, she experienced an escalation of symptoms in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started having really bad cramps all the time, even when I wasn't bleeding,” she recalls. “I would just get this sharp stabbing pain on my right side that would leave me just completely incapacitated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors kept telling her to give her body a few months to adjust to the switch. For a year, Poffenroth pushed off asking them about her symptoms, even though she was leaving work early or waking up in the middle of the night, crying in pain, multiple times a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finally receiving an ultrasound in 2018, the doctors said “everything was normal,” and didn’t discuss her results in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poffenroth decided to make a color-coded calendar for her doctor that showed how many days she was bleeding when she shouldn’t have been and rated her pain on a pain scale daily. After taking it to his office, she pleaded, “This is not normal. Please fix this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her IUD was removed that same day. She eventually switched to continuous birth control, which stops periods, but started bleeding through that. In October 2024, an ultrasound under a new doctor detected markers for adenomyosis. She had a thicker endometrial lining than the average person and was a candidate for a hysterectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When (my doctor) walked into the room with the results, the first thing she said was, ‘Good news. It's not all in your head.’ I immediately started crying because I was so relieved,” Poffenroth says. “The worst part was when I wasn’t getting answers, because that’s when I felt the most invalidated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her hysterectomy is set for June 12. She has a countdown on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still feel like I've had it easier than a lot of people,” she says. “But I also think that is related to how women minimize their pain and suffering a lot of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I was trying to survive' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/08/27/yale-fertility-center-women-egg-retrievals/74736108007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Fertility Center patients say signs of neglect were there all along;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yale Fertility Center patients say signs of neglect were there all along&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darlene Valencia wasn’t diagnosed with adenomyosis until after her surgery, despite suffering from painful and heavy periods for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The doctor recommended a hysterectomy. He never said why,” the 45-year-old says. At least three months passed before the procedure, and she was bleeding the whole time. When the report came back that she had adenomyosis, the doctor said, “I knew that’s what it was going to be all along.” She asked what it was and he gave her the "textbook definition," but left it at, “It’s gone now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt really uncomfortable,” she says. “I feel fantastic now, (but) I kind of mourn my 30s, because I could have been feeling this way a long time ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Darlene "Dee" Valencia didn't know she had adenomyosis until after her hysterectomy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Fleming, 52, is an active mother of two who enjoys sailing and hiking. At 30, her ultrasound showed markers for adenomyosis, but she didn't want a hysterectomy — she was busy with her career, traveling and taking care of two young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in January 2023, she had a period that lasted for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The blood loss is crazy,” she says. “Tampons don’t even matter, because you’re gonna stick them in and you’re going to pull them out in 15 minutes. It’s scary when you’re looking at it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctor dismissed her concerns. "He just chalked it up to being close to menopause,” she says. “There was no, ‘Hey, you don’t have to go through this.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took a trip to the UC Davis Medical Center's emergency room in Sacramento, California. A uterine biopsy confirmed that she did not have cancer, but adenomyosis. She’s tried progesterone pills and an IUD to manage her symptoms, but the IUD isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like crying, because I’ve been trying to hold out from major surgeries,” she says. “This bleeding situation sucks because I’ve stopped sailing because of it. I was trying to go on this 40-mile backpacking trip. I can’t do any of that right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Jennifer Fleming believes going to the emergency room was why she was able to get the proper care from gynecological specialists at UC Davis Medical Center.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Hysterectomy is the gold standard'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue with adenomyosis care, Danilyants says, is that the doctors often treating patients are OBGYNs who “like to treat everything medically" by prescribing birth control and pain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Birth control pills are not effective. It's treated by surgery,” she explains. “Hysterectomy is the gold standard for treating adenomyosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also an economic burden of untreated disease — chronic pain, infertility treatments and lost wages, Danilyants adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disease affects millions of women, and they're going to the ER getting blood transfusions. They're seeing a hematologist to get iron infusions,” she says. “So this is years and years of spending money to treat this condition that could have easily been treated with surgery. OBGYNs should be referring to specialists who can provide better treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams can’t help but wonder what her life would have been like if she had a different doctor or known about adenomyosis sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Periods shouldn't be that painful. This is real and you need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously,” she says. “I will never have a child now. I have my brother, but it's been a journey. I want women to believe in themselves, trust themselves, and seek a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/03/24/adenomyosis-women-health-heavy-painful-periods/82590724007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adenomyosis plagues women's lives but goes undiagnosed for decades;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Adenomyosis plagues women's lives but goes undiagnosed for decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:02:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPeEdIdUVVVUZPN2s4cnZ3Q1NfVmxxbVFkNGZObWxjNUpjZnVpUTVLSlNWckhwdzZKbTBBSjkyUnFlYTBxNzNkTURhT29rS1l1b0huSEIwWDhlcG1ZaHZWMUVzRHNTMkFEMFJScnJybkt2ZkhZdy1Va0dFSEs5RjNleWl3</guid></item><item><title>Women are at much higher risk of long COVID than men.

It also found notable differences in long COVID risk among women, depending on age and menopausal status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women ages 40 to 54 who are not menopausal are at highest risk — they are 45% more likely to get long COVID than men of the same age group, according to the study, the NIH-funded RECOVER study that includes one of the largest data sets on people with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, women 40 to 54 who are menopausal are not significantly more likely to get long COVID than men of the same age group. Women 18 to 39 are also not significantly more likely to get long COVID compared to their male counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that changes that occur in menopause — including a decline in estrogen and changes in the immune system — may affect long COVID risk, said Dr. Dimpy Shah, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and lead author of the JAMA study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After menopause hits, the risk becomes almost similar between males and females,” Shah said. “That means females are no longer at (higher) risk once they hit menopause.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who are menopausal have lower estrogen levels than women who are not yet menopausal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think estrogen plays a role for high risk of long COVID,” Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may be that changes that occur during pregnancy — most pregnant women in the study were in the 18-to-39 group — such as higher progesterone levels, or the body’s response to antigens, may put pregnant women at lower risk for long COVID than non-pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s an interplay of all these things that affect risk of long COVID over various stages of life in females,” Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 p1h5oaun mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale immunologist Akiko Iwasaki is a leading long COVID researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yale University/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate from the JAMA study, Iwasaki said the most striking finding on sex differences in long COVID is that lower levels of testosterone is the top predictor of whether women have long COVID; women with long COVID have lower levels of the hormone than women without long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lower levels of estradiol, a type of estrogen, is the top predictor of whether men have long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These dysfunctional sex hormones we find in many patients may also be at play,” Iwasaki said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genetic factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been theorized that women, who have two X chromosomes, may be more prone to autoimmune disorders than men, who have one X and one Y chromosome, in part because many genes related to immunity are on the X chromosome. These include genes that regulate how T-cells respond to antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with long COVID appear to have elevated levels of exhausted T-cells, which accumulate when someone cannot clear an infection, Iwasaki said.

Previous studies, for instance, have found that women are able to clear some malaria infections and initial COVID infections faster than men, said Dr. Prasanna Jagannathan, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford who specializes in infectious diseases and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why that is is not entirely understood,” Jagannathan said. “There is a big research gap, generally, in trying to understand why responses to infectious diseases could have these sex biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s not entirely clear why women get long COVID more often, it’s important for women and health care providers to be aware that women are at higher risk, Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If women are experiencing lingering symptoms, it’s important not to ignore those symptoms and talk to their medical provider because they may have long COVID, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We feel half the population being at higher risk for long COVID has health policy implications as well,” Shah said. “We should be mindful to consider this is a higher risk group. This is just a starting point. We need to do so much more research with regard to what’s driving this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p class="cci_endnote_contact" title="CCI End Note Contact"&gt;Reach Catherine Ho: cho@sfchronicle.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPdU51M0FLaFp5LUtmYlZSNFZwUkN6eFY4S3Y3dTdYUk5nZS1sRkE2cVBHNS1ZRURYQURkNV9ESnl4YTBja0k0Q2huMFlFZ01JQXV6NDNOZ2lXTExiRF9wMnF1UW1UU192dUE3RUotYmV4T1lRdTgyTkk2X0lMLWh3bHljR1J6UQ</guid></item><item><title>National study finds one in four adults misusing prescription stimulants - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNMEYyWE5DVEF3VHNDbUFGSjVLTnZ6bkZSaVVKblNuLUhpUXNRYVZQQlMzY3NENVctTklCRURpbkJTbWczamx6aDlsOW9rQjN6SlRHV3RiZ3Qtb0N6SW5FSkhCLTNQek9qQU5yN2pYSHJHSTFOeUV6azhJbGhKYThHTDJ2S2Zhbkxs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that 1 in 4 adults using prescription stimulants engaged in misuse, and nearly 1 in 10 met the criteria for prescription stimulant use disorder (PSUD).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Findings show that amphetamine users were more likely to experience PSUD than those prescribed methylphenidate. Increased prescribing rates, particularly among middle-aged women, were observed, yet this demographic exhibited lower &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/misuse/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;misuse&lt;/a&gt; rates than younger &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns over stimulant misuse have grown as prescribing rates for these medications, commonly used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have increased. Clinical practice guidelines for adult ADHD remain absent, leading to variations in diagnosis and treatment. Questions about appropriate use persist as research indicates both the protective benefits of ADHD pharmacotherapy and its potential risks, including misuse, overprescription, and development of use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Prescription Stimulant Use, Misuse, and Use Disorder Among US Adults Aged 18 to 64 Years," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey study to understand patterns of prescription stimulant use and misuse among adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulant prescribing trends from 2019 through 2022 were examined using pharmaceutical databases that captured 93% of outpatient prescriptions dispensed in U.S. retail pharmacies. Additional data on stimulant misuse, PSUD prevalence, and associated behavioral health conditions were drawn from the NSDUH survey results. Survey responses from 83,762 adults aged 18 to 64 years were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results indicate that 25.3% of adults using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prescription+stimulants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prescription stimulants&lt;/a&gt; reported misuse, with 9.0% meeting the criteria for PSUD. Among those with PSUD, 72.9% used only their own prescribed stimulants, and 87.1% were prescribed amphetamines. Analysis revealed that amphetamine users were 3.1 times more likely to misuse their medication than those prescribed methylphenidate, with a 2.2 times greater likelihood of developing PSUD.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Prescriptions for stimulants increased across all demographics, with the most substantial rise occurring among women aged 35 to 64 years. Misuse of prescription stimulants was more common among individuals with depression, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicidal+ideation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicidal ideation&lt;/a&gt;, or concurrent substance use disorders. Women aged 35 to 64 years exhibited a lower prevalence of misuse than younger adults, with rates of 13.7% compared to 36.8% among women aged 18 to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, "Our results underscore the importance of developing and implementing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+practice+guidelines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical practice guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for adult ADHD and strengthening evidence-based clinician training programs on adult ADHD diagnosis and multimodal care. Moreover, our findings highlight the need for prevention and intervention of prescription stimulant misuse, diversion, or PSUD regardless of misuse status and the reasons for prescribing stimulants."&lt;/p&gt;

To that end, Bethenny recently launched &lt;a href="https://bethenny.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The List;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The List&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where all of her favorite finds and candid thoughts live in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 54 years old, Bethenny continues to be as lively and vital as ever—which got us wondering about what her health and wellness list might look like too. From magnesium foot sprays to digestive water boosters, Bethenny shared with &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; her top five tips and tricks for staying happy and healthy in her 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. She doesn't cut corners when it comes to sleep hygiene.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a stressful period of life left Bethenny chasing Zs—at one point she was only getting about five hours a night—she got serious about sleep hygiene. “Sleep is a big character in my life, and the effort that I make to get sleep and the different things that I do to get sleep are militant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s not kidding: Her night time routine truly is a head-to-toe affair. Bethenny starts with an eye mask to block out any potential sunlight that might seep through the curtains or blinds, which is “critical,” she says. To stop her teeth from grinding, she started wearing a night guard in her 40s, and she recently added mouth tape to the equation, which she says has helped further ease her jaw muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around her neck she wraps a scented pillow fresh out of a warming cabinet (think: that magical device from which a masseuse or manicurist pulls a hot towel) in order to help herself relax. She might pop a gummy or two (she’s sent a ton of samples so she dabbles—be it melatonin or cannabis-infused), and, to finish, she spritzes the soles of her feet with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a26947301/magnesium-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;magnesium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spray. Bethenny attributes this full routine to helping increase her sleep duration to around eight hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. She aims for 10,000 steps per day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethenny adheres to a pretty no-frills workout routine: walking. Okay, sure, she might hop into the occasional yoga class from time to time (she also tried weights once—it didn’t stick, she says). But Bethenny says that walking is really the only consistent form of movement she prioritizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She aims for 10,000 steps a day—usually outside in nature—and says that she generally sleeps better if she hits that mark. (Again, it all goes back to sleep.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DMX Comfort+ Sneaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP68MCRL?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64275987%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$39.97 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$39.97 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gel-Nimbus 26&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFNM471F?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64275987%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$217.50 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$217.50 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloudrunner 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5QJX7N9?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64275987%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$165.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$165.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. She got sober curious. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow Bethenny on social media, you’ve probably watched her &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHKH4AigXud/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:taste-testing alcohol alternatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;taste-testing alcohol alternatives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or touting her own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minglemocktails.com%2Fpages%2Fbethenny%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorXyX0qDR5NIX5SA4TV5yBC_k6J_ERp_SuA7_K4WungFTk9eSJd&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64275987%2Fbethenny-frankel-workout-diet-age%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mingle Mocktails;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mingle Mocktails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That's because she’s mostly stopped drinking over the past few months. Without alcohol, Bethenny says, she’s able to balance her emotional levels better. “It’s how you're reacting to something, how you're dealing with something, how irritable you are,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. She supercharges her water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with reducing her alcohol intake, Bethenny makes sure she stays hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Bethenny suffers from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61816919/katie-ledecky-pots/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:POTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;POTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome—a condition in which the heart rate rises rapidly after sitting or lying down. It can cause light-headedness and faintness upon standing. Severe dehydration is another of Bethenny’s symptoms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plant-Based Electrolyte Drink Mix&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRRRKDK5?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64275987%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$23.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$23.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she isn’t chugging plain H2O to avoid dehydration issues—her water often pulls double-duty. “I put hydration packets in my water,” she says. “There are several different types of water flavor stories that I have going on—some are relaxing, some are hydrating, some are digestive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_bethenny_frankel_workout_diet_age_a64275987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for exclusive fitness and nutrition programs created exclusively for subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the gummies, she’s willing to try a little bit of this, a little bit of that. She recently sampled &lt;a href="https://belliwelli.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqJUOQoD1ndVai76UFk2E7P0MMjdbxMQLXgMgQQoQz7pvfeMdSM" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BelliWelli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BelliWelli&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was a fan of the flavor. She also digs the new strawberries and cream variety of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrinknello.com%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopfrOeKxTrfhCmvVx6QMOwAGYZJvrclc5bxMZQ-44B7XV_v9ZMb&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64275987%2Fbethenny-frankel-workout-diet-age%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nello;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nello&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. She focuses on moderation, not perfection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bethenny's approach to health and wellness boils down to the principle of balance. In her diet, that means eating the fruits she loves, like pineapple and watermelon, plus also allowing herself a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHJImMygnac/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chewy orange slice candy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chewy orange slice candy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that brings her back to her childhood. Or, while she’s embarking on her sober curious journey, sipping the occasional cocktail while out at a celebratory dinner with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe in balance, and I've taught that to my daughter too,” Bethenny says. “I'm not educated on every single thing. I barely know what &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63620912/are-seed-oils-bad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seed oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seed oils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are.

That's because she’s mostly stopped drinking over the past few months.

PAUL (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="//wjon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;WJON News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) -- The H5N1 virus has been detected on a dairy farm in central Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Crusan&lt;/strong&gt; with the Minnesota Board of Animal Health says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bah.state.mn.us/node/2016" target="_blank"&gt;a 600-dairy herd has been affected in Stearns County.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in Stearns County, we also have a lot of migratory birds that affect our numbers when it comes to finding avian influenza and H5N1. So it’s appearing to be that it might be a hot spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crusan says it’s the first detection in livestock since last summer and was discovered during mandatory raw milk surveillance testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low and behold, that testing resulted in a positive detection in Stearns County. So, we do have H5N1 in a dairy herd in Minnesota. I’ll say it’s back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crusan says the same farm was affected last summer and is one of only a handful of dairies in the state to test positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor &lt;strong&gt;Brian Hoefs&lt;/strong&gt; is executive director of the&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bah.state.mn.us/h5n1" target="_blank"&gt; Minnesota Board of Animal Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;to determine if this active infection or if it potentially is an infection that is waxing and waning and on its way out. So additional testing would be weekly testing on that farm until we get consecutive weeks of negative tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoefs says bird flu is always fatal in poultry but is considered more of a "nuisance" disease in the cattle industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that pasteurization milk is effective in deactivating the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;READ RELATED ARTICLES&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Tour Waite Park -- Past and Present -- in Pictures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJON News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:07:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBrOEN2V19vQm9rcU1kNV9ZZ0VfNDc4Ml9HV0dVUUtETmF3bFotQ1ZVS2JZcGNPUGgtVGRvQjRuVmZKMXVGRXFBTmpqbjF4dXdiekZKVF9xUnlNVFdMX19DaA</guid></item><item><title>In fascinating study, neuroscientists reveal the unique impact of nostalgic music on the brain - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNV3ZZSWswV29jNE1aUzdVQnk2UUsxS19NU2dkaEh2a2dwMFhRUmE2UnRSVlBHdFJyc015ZTctSWtYRldqQzU3NWZ1OXpxdlR3bllkNWNpN2tiNzBuZ0JULW44b3lPOU52b3ZLNnFjNEFrMXVxMlFUa2s2NTVYMXNRMkpXZ0tJWVNMNlRxUjhRcTdIbHBzTkVhMWZoeEdXYVR2TjdsS1hYTWQ2QmtBRjF3TjVmcHBEUFRqOWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Human Brain Mapping&lt;/em&gt; has found that music which evokes nostalgia activates a unique network of brain regions tied to memory, self-reflection, and emotion. Researchers discovered that self-selected nostalgic songs triggered more brain activity than familiar or unfamiliar non-nostalgic music in both younger and older adults. Notably, older adults showed even stronger activation in key nostalgia-related areas, suggesting nostalgic music may play a special role in memory and emotional processing later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was driven by growing interest in how music can help people with memory loss, especially those with Alzheimer’s disease or related conditions. While it’s well known that music can stir strong emotions and bring back personal memories, scientists have only recently started to explore the brain’s response to nostalgic music in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the new study was to understand how nostalgia-evoking music differs from other types of music in the brain, and how these effects might vary across the lifespan. This foundational knowledge could eventually inform new therapies using music to help preserve memory and emotional well-being in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up as an avid musician and music listener. As a teenager, I began to notice how certain songs could transport me back to moment in time, where I could truly feel how I&lt;br&gt; felt in that moment or era of my life and return to that headspace,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.sarahlouisehennessy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Hennessy&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Arizona, who conducted the study while a PhD student at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d be listening to the Beatles White Album and I’d be back in the car with my dad, driving to school for fourth grade through the snow and sipping a hot chocolate. I began collecting these types of songs and ‘saving them for a rainy day,’ in a way, where I listened to them when I felt lonely, or simply needed to reminisce.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Later, various anecdotal reports began to emerge that individuals with Alzheimer’s and other dementias could still emotionally respond to personalized music, even with profound memory degradation, which I was very interested in. Unsurprisingly, this fascination continued into my research career! So my primary motivation for this project was to understand why and how we feel nostalgia associated with music, and how this manifests in the brain across adulthood, which will help us understand these processes in individuals with cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 57 healthy participants—29 younger adults aged 18 to 35, and 28 older adults aged 60 and above. Each participant identified six songs that personally evoked nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nostalgic music is not universal,” Hennessy noted. “Every individual has a different personalized set of nostalgic songs that have meaning and memories attached to them. These songs span across every genre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used a machine-learning tool to find other songs that were musically similar in tempo, key, and energy, but did not evoke nostalgia. These were used as “familiar control” songs. Additionally, the team selected unfamiliar songs that were also musically matched, ensuring that differences in brain activity could be attributed to nostalgia rather than musical features or familiarity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the main experiment, participants listened to their nostalgia-evoking songs, as well as the matched familiar and unfamiliar control songs, while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Each song was played for 40 seconds, and participants kept their eyes closed to focus on the music and any thoughts or feelings it evoked. Afterward, they completed tasks assessing memory and rated how nostalgic, positive, or emotionally intense the songs felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain scans revealed that nostalgic songs, more than the control songs, activated a wide array of brain regions. These included areas involved in self-reflection and memory (such as the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus), emotional salience (like the insula and anterior cingulate cortex), and reward processing (including the ventral tegmental area and orbitofrontal cortex). These regions together form a network associated with processing autobiographical memories, regulating emotions, and feeling pleasure—all key elements of the nostalgic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the nostalgic songs also triggered increased functional connectivity between brain regions involved in self-related processing and emotional awareness. Specifically, the posterior medial cortex showed stronger communication with the anterior insula when participants listened to nostalgic music, suggesting that nostalgia may integrate personal memories with emotional significance in a particularly powerful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite all of the differences present in musical choice, nostalgia as evoked by music is associated with a very clear pattern in the brain across individuals and across the lifespan,” Hennessy told PsyPost. “This pattern involves parts of the brain called the default mode network and the reward network. These networks of the brain help us process information about our own life stories, and respond to things that bring us pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults not only reported feeling more positive emotions while listening to music in general, but they also showed stronger brain responses to nostalgic songs than younger adults. In particular, older participants showed greater activation in brain areas related to sound, memory, and emotional meaning, such as the temporal pole, angular gyrus, and sensory processing regions. The findings suggest that older adults may engage more deeply with nostalgic music, possibly reflecting a shift in emotional priorities with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that older adults actually had slightly stronger activation in these nostalgia-related regions than younger adults,” Hennessy explained. “We expected older and younger adults to have similar patterns of activation, but this finding was a bit unexpected. There are a few different explanations for this finding, but future work is needed to really parse them apart. But for now, it’s an interesting piece of information to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our sample was from the greater Los Angeles area, so of course is not representative of all younger and older adults,” Hennessy noted. “I think there is a lot of cool work to be done exploring the role of culture in music-evoked nostalgia and autobiographical memory. Participants only listed to 40 second clips in the scanner (we hope to explore these research questions with full-length pieces in the future). However, the fact that we saw such robust effects with only 40 seconds is pretty amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this research represents a significant step toward understanding the neuroscience of nostalgia and how music taps into deep emotional and autobiographical experiences. The study’s authors hope to apply these insights to future work with clinical populations, including individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to use this research to create, improve, and understand music-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases,” Hennessy explained. “If we can understand how music-evoked memories and emotions can remain in individuals with dementia, we can learn how to harness music to improve quality of life for these individuals and their caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.70181" target="_blank"&gt;Music-Evoked Nostalgia Activates Default Mode and Reward Networks Across the Lifespan&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah Hennessy, Petr Janata, Talia Ginsberg, Jonas Kaplan, and Assal Habibi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:02:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNV3ZZSWswV29jNE1aUzdVQnk2UUsxS19NU2dkaEh2a2dwMFhRUmE2UnRSVlBHdFJyc015ZTctSWtYRldqQzU3NWZ1OXpxdlR3bllkNWNpN2tiNzBuZ0JULW44b3lPOU52b3ZLNnFjNEFrMXVxMlFUa2s2NTVYMXNRMkpXZ0tJWVNMNlRxUjhRcTdIbHBzTkVhMWZoeEdXYVR2TjdsS1hYTWQ2QmtBRjF3TjVmcHBEUFRqOWc</guid></item><item><title>Struggling through menopause?

During a commercial break, heart racing and brain foggy, Fadal went to lie down on the women’s bathroom floor and didn’t return to the anchor desk. It was the first time in her 25-year news career that she’d left a news broadcast unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadal consulted doctor after doctor to explain her symptoms of brain fog, nausea and a racing heart. It wasn’t until one of them left a note in her patient portal that she received a clear diagnosis: “In menopause. Any questions?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="infobox" data-click="infoBox" data-module-id="0000018f-3b10-de58-afaf-bbdb2f310002"&gt;       &lt;p class="infobox-description"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shelf Help is a wellness column where we interview researchers, thinkers and writers about their latest books — all with the aim of learning how to live a more complete life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shocked by the lack of education she received from healthcare practitioners about such a tumultuous stage of her life, Fadal started researching menopause and educating women online about her findings. Her new book, “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/tamsen-fadal/how-to-menopause/9780306833540/?lens=balance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to Menopause: Take Charge of Your Health, Reclaim Your Life, and Feel Even Better Than Before”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Hatchette), combines the wisdom of neuroscientists, relationship therapists, physicians and other lifestyle mentors to create the ultimate women’s manual on menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before her journey with menopause, Fadal never could have predicted the symptoms she experienced. “I didn’t even know perimenopause existed,” she recalls. But finally finding a doctor educated in menopause and willing to talk to her about hormone therapy was a “game-changer” for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times spoke with Fadal about how women can speak up for themselves at the doctor’s office and how menopause can affect a woman’s career.

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What did your life look like before menopause hit, and how does menopause typically interact with the life circumstances of a woman?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During midlife, I was constantly asking myself, “What now? What am I supposed to do? Where am I going next, and what do I want?” I think those are the four hardest words that anybody can answer: “What do I want?” Midlife is a time when many of us hit a second chapter or transition period, and we often think we’re supposed to know exactly what to do, but we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no road map for this time of our lives. With kids and aging parents who need and rely on us around this time, something often changes in relationships, and then on top of that comes perimenopause or menopause, and we don’t know what to do with all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have a hormone shift, everything changes. It’s not just periods or brain fog or sleep. It’s everything. A lot of women start to feel very, very lost. Our communities change, our relationships change, our workplaces change and how we feel about ourselves changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In your book you argue that the medical system is not designed to treat women in midlife. How would you change it for the better?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to do whatever we can to help doctors and those studying to be doctors understand menopause — and in all practices, not just OB/GYN. Menopause training should be part of the main curriculum for all doctors — we’re seeing even so many OB/GYNs now who have had to train themselves on menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part is educating women. Just as we have timelines for things like mammograms and colonoscopies, I would love to see timelines for menopause training where at age 35, we start explaining symptoms to women. Often menopause is diagnosed by symptoms, not bloodwork, so women need to be able to spot those symptoms early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women were not part of health studies until the mid-’90s, and there’s still not a lot of money that goes toward medical research on women in the midlife period. For that reason, my team and I are constantly advocating for more funding so we can get more research done and have more answers.

If your symptoms aren’t that bad, don’t worry about it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red flag:&lt;i&gt; If you’re still getting your period, you don’t need to even worry about any of the symptoms. You can’t do anything until after you’re done 365 days of your period.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red flag: &lt;i&gt;Hormone therapy is dangerous. You shouldn’t do that. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently did a panel with two doctors, and both of them said people are calling their front desk asking: “Is your doctor educated in menopause, and are they comfortable talking about hormone therapy?” which is everything we’ve been talking about for the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get into the office, you should ask:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are my options for hormone therapy? When can we start that? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the different types of options for hormones?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there contra-indicators for hormone therapy? Am I a candidate for it? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the lifestyle changes that would be good for me to implement during this time, so I can be treating my whole body well rather than just easing hot flashes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any other tests I should be taking right now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt; &lt;div class="quote" data-module-id="00000195-ab3d-d8ec-a19f-fb3f5af40018"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;I think menopause can signal that we’re at the beginning of a whole new part of our lives that’s really exciting.

How can menopause affect a woman’s career and how would you suggest women broach conversations about menopause in their workplaces?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of menopause can be debilitating. If you don’t sleep at night, you’re not operating fully functionally. If you’re dealing with brain fog or sweating in your clothes all the time, it can be embarrassing and you can lose confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women should be asking their workplaces:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an option for flexible hours? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an option for uniform changes, if you’ve got uniforms?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an option to go outside to take a break? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a way you can offer benefits? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you give women resources to go to for some type of menopause coaching?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are many ways workplaces can help women that don’t have to be so high-level and expensive such that they’d automatically say no. It’s important for workplaces to consider these flexibility options because we don’t want to lose women at this important time in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my previous workplace, I went into my HR department and said, “I’m a 52-year-old woman. I know I’m in menopause, and we need to have some kind of policy to help women. What is part of our policy to help us get some treatment for this, or are we on our own?” I left before this policy was fully implemented, but I know they took me seriously and are still working on making positive changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t easy, but workplaces are changing: CVS just &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cvshealth.com/news/womens-health-care/cvs-health-becomes-first-company-in-the-us-to-earn-menopause-friendly-accreditation.html#:~:text=Womens%20Health%20Care-,CVS%20Health%20becomes%20first%20company%20in,to%20earn%20menopause%2Dfriendly%20accreditation&amp;amp;text=CVS%20Health%C2%AE%20is%20the,menopause%20services%2C%20education%20and%20advocacy." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Not everyone can do hormone therapy, which has really helped me. If my mom were alive today, hormone therapy would not be an option for her because she had breast cancer. In that case, she’d have to look at major lifestyle changes like taking magnesium to improve her sleep, increasing her protein intake and strength training, and decreasing her stress. She’d have to look at trigger foods and drinks for hot flashes, like alcohol and caffeine. I’d want her to take vitamin D supplements and collagen as a routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do you think menopause has been a hush-hush topic in the past, and why is it so important that open conversations about it continue?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="infobox" data-click="infoBox" data-border-top data-module-id="00000195-ab42-da6a-addf-fbfa9c21000b"&gt;    &lt;p class="infobox-title"&gt;TAKEAWAYS&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="infobox-description"&gt;from “How to Menopause”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of menopause has often been so wrapped up in ageism, and I think it made a woman always feel like she was at the end of her best years. We are very clear now that that’s not the case. In fact, I think menopause can signal that we’re at the beginning of a whole new part of our lives that’s really exciting. I call these my bolden years, not my golden years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that people understand how to tame their symptoms of menopause because it means so much for their long-term health. It’s not just uncomfortable hot flashes, it’s changing our brains, our hearts and our bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage younger women to learn about menopause early so they can understand when they’re going through perimenopause and not wonder on their own what those symptoms mean. I’m really encouraged by the fact that I have a lot of young women in their mid-30s online in my community who ask great questions. If we don’t keep talking about menopause, we’re just going to keep this cycle going where women are not important and a priority, and we can’t do that any longer.

(In case you’re not familiar with it, glycemic variability is how much blood glucose levels go up and down. In a perfect world, they’re stable.) The study’s authors pointed out that glycemic variability is a risk factor for chronic disease and early death, which makes it reasonable to wonder if going to bed after midnight puts you at risk for those bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Falling asleep past midnight can also affect your mental health.

It also means you may be messing with your circadian rhythm, which is your body’s natural 24-hour cycle, she adds. Your circadian rhythm helps regulate multiple physiological and behavioral processes in your body, including signaling to your body that it’s time to wake up or wind down for bed, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our natural circadian rhythms usually have us going to bed earlier, before midnight,” Malow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Going to bed past midnight here and there can mess with your health too. Falling asleep after 12 a.m. if you typically go to bed around 10 p.m. may mean that you don’t get as much deep sleep as you need, Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Deep sleep happens predominantly in that first one to two hours. So, for the average sleeper, that’s probably 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.,” he explains. “Going to bed after midnight means missing out on the bulk of deep sleep/slow wave sleep.” This phase of sleep is when growth hormone and other chemicals are secreted — missing out can inhibit those and increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol, according to Winter. “Both negatively affect blood sugar and mood,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-move-up-your-bedtime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to move up your bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you consistently go to bed at midnight or even later, but you don’t have to be up early the next morning, your standard bedtime may not be an issue. But if you feel like you have trouble going to bed before midnight and you have to be somewhere in the morning, sleep specialists say there are a few things you can do to try to move up your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a big dose of bright light in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt; Wu recommends going outside for 20 minutes or so, if you can fit it into your morning. This helps signal to your body that it’s time to wake up and helps to keep your circadian rhythm in line with the daylight. If that’s not doable, Winter suggests eating breakfast or getting ready next to a window to expose yourself to natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t nap during the day.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be difficult to achieve if your sleep wasn’t great the night before. But Winter points out that naps can throw your sleep schedule out of whack and push your bedtime back even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider wearing blue light glasses before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; Screens emit blue light, which can&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with your circadian rhythm;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; interfere with your circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and your ability to wind down before bed. That’s why doctors usually recommend staying off screens before bed. Unfortunately, that’s not possible for everyone, and for that reason, Wu suggests wearing blue-light-blocking sunglasses for several hours before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Having an exercise routine in place can help support good sleep, Malow says. She recommends maximizing physical activity during the day so that you’re ready to crash when bedtime rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you feel as though you've tried everything and still your sleep isn’t as healthy as it should be, it’s worth consulting a health care professional to help determine what might be going on. But, if you regularly go to bed at midnight and wake up feeling refreshed, more power to you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQQW5BeUpUWC1VRDhQdEdLOVZZR0VVd1BndlEtZUpaYUNKNXpqQ3N2cUFxZWRMZHZnbFFySzl1RHl6MElUOUI3emlmRFZBdHR0Y0VQajl6eGFBNDVxS1VtcklxOTlEd0VtVmZkRklmQWYtcElSc0FCT25XRDB2bGh0MlROcjBlYVVaNTdyNm85MlB3alJNMUs2WDVSQmVXalBNUDg4R1Vrc1oybXNubWF4dWhRS3M</guid></item><item><title>What regularly going to sleep after midnight says about your health - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOdHhGS1ZHNVVfcFdVeW9FN2F5anJkdjhEV1VJU2YxQ3J6WTlWZTJaRFpieVl3VmJzdlNLbmJfZEdfaWcxcWNNYWZKWWlldjJFS2JiRWRhUnMwaFV6TWx0cEs4RHlOM0FVcTBvX1YxSXZXTF8xTFRBLUM4dHpaLUU1eGtEcXVIaEMwbVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s no universal rule that says you have to go to bed at a certain time when you’re an adult, but you’ve likely heard the common refrain that it’s best to fall asleep before midnight.

Falling asleep after 12 a.m. if you typically go to bed around 10 p.m. may mean that you don’t get as much deep sleep as you need, Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Deep sleep happens predominantly in that first one to two hours. So, for the average sleeper, that’s probably 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.,” he explains. “Going to bed after midnight means missing out on the bulk of deep sleep/slow wave sleep.” This phase of sleep is when growth hormone and other chemicals are secreted — missing out can inhibit those and increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol, according to Winter. “Both negatively affect blood sugar and mood,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-move-up-your-bedtime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to move up your bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you consistently go to bed at midnight or even later, but you don’t have to be up early the next morning, your standard bedtime may not be an issue. But if you feel like you have trouble going to bed before midnight and you have to be somewhere in the morning, sleep specialists say there are a few things you can do to try to move up your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a big dose of bright light in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt; Wu recommends going outside for 20 minutes or so, if you can fit it into your morning. This helps signal to your body that it’s time to wake up and helps to keep your circadian rhythm in line with the daylight. If that’s not doable, Winter suggests eating breakfast or getting ready next to a window to expose yourself to natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t nap during the day.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be difficult to achieve if your sleep wasn’t great the night before. But Winter points out that naps can throw your sleep schedule out of whack and push your bedtime back even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider wearing blue light glasses before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; Screens emit blue light, which can&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with your circadian rhythm;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; interfere with your circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and your ability to wind down before bed. That’s why doctors usually recommend staying off screens before bed. Unfortunately, that’s not possible for everyone, and for that reason, Wu suggests wearing blue-light-blocking sunglasses for several hours before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Having an exercise routine in place can help support good sleep, Malow says. She recommends maximizing physical activity during the day so that you’re ready to crash when bedtime rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you feel as though you've tried everything and still your sleep isn’t as healthy as it should be, it’s worth consulting a health care professional to help determine what might be going on. But, if you regularly go to bed at midnight and wake up feeling refreshed, more power to you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOdHhGS1ZHNVVfcFdVeW9FN2F5anJkdjhEV1VJU2YxQ3J6WTlWZTJaRFpieVl3VmJzdlNLbmJfZEdfaWcxcWNNYWZKWWlldjJFS2JiRWRhUnMwaFV6TWx0cEs4RHlOM0FVcTBvX1YxSXZXTF8xTFRBLUM4dHpaLUU1eGtEcXVIaEMwbVE</guid></item><item><title>What makes humans intelligent?

								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/03/25/what-makes-humans-intelligent-these-unique-neurons-might-hold-the-key/"&gt;
																	
																
								&lt;p&gt;You probably have a general understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/04/04/the-average-human-brain-size-is-growing--but-that-doesnt-exactly-mean-were-smarter/" target="_blank"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;: a network of nerve cells connected by synapses. Complex or abstract ideas emerge as a result of the firing of many of these nerve cells, or neurons. This means that a concept or memory or idea is the result of a distributed pattern of neural activity. In contrast to computer memory, which always follows the same pattern of 1s and 0s, it's more like networks in our brain weave a new tapestry every time we think about something. This understanding is common to most of us lay people who know a little about neurology and the brain, or who are interested in AI and the attempts to replicate human intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you may be badly out of date. As it turns out, in human brains, we also have a specialized type of cell called a concept neuron, which does what was long thought to be impossible: each of these cells encodes entire concepts, so that that single neuron fires whenever you’re exposed to a stimulus relating to that concept, or even when you think about it without an external stimulus. This would be like having a single neuron that fires when you see a photograph of your grandmother, hear her voice, read her name or perhaps even smell her familiar perfume. This single neuron thus has semantic invariance for the concept of your grandmother. This means that it fires whenever your grandmother is the topic of thought, regardless of the context or medium or the sense that stimulates your thought of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Florian Mormann, a physician and researcher who heads a working group on cognitive and clinical neurophysiology at the University of Bonn, told Salon in a video interview that “textbooks of neuroscience that still exist today often mention the grandmother neuron as an example of something you would never find in a brain. Because clearly, it would be so much more efficient to simply have a network of eight neurons if it can do the same job as 70 different neurons. So it seemed a no-brainer for everyone that there shouldn’t be grandmother neurons in any brain”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the no-brainer is seemingly wrong about the brain. As it turns out, grandmother neurons, or concept cells as they’re now known (or Jennifer Aniston neurons as they were called for a bit, as we’ll see) have been right there in our brains all along. And some scientists have known they are there, gradually learning more about them and their implications, over the past 20 years. It’s not a conspiracy: the news just hasn’t really trickled out to the rest of us. That’s partly because most scientists who physically get right inside skulls to study the brains inside them do so with the brains of non-human animals, so most brain research we hear about still doesn’t involve these neurons, which it seems exist exclusively in the human brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://friedcnl.ucla.edu/team_members/rodrigo-quian-quiroga-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Centre for Systems Neuroscience at the University of Leicester, discovered concept cells twenty years ago. In research published in January, a team led by Quian Quiroga &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01569-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124724015699%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;showed for the first time the way they respond to a given concept&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the context. This is in contrast to everything that is known about how memories are encoded in non-human animals, and it suggests that this might be a key adaptation behind human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not ethical to carry out invasive procedures on human brains. For this reason, we don’t often conduct single neuron recordings, a type of research that requires access right inside the skull, on humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So in the past 50 years [single neuron recordings have] been done on a huge scale in especially rodents and also in monkeys, plus a few other mammals. But it’s mainly those two species,” Mormann, who, like Quian Quiroga, is one of very few researchers to conduct single neuron studies on humans, told Salon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual neurons could be extremely selective, with a single neuron firing predictably in response to images of a single animal, individual or place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And of course, the multi-million dollar industry of rodent research does not exist because we’re all so fascinated by what the rodent brain can do. Not at all. It is because we believe it could serve as a valid model of the human brain for human episodic memory,” Mormann added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, neuroscience has relied on the data gathered from doing such procedures on mouse and primate models. The assumption that underlies this is that a mouse or monkey brain serves as an adequate, if simplified, proxy for the human. And indeed, that’s been good enough to fuel decades of brain science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single neuron recordings in humans &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single neuron recordings are otherwise only done in rodent or primate models because brain surgery is never without risks, and those are not risks we usually ask humans to take without extremely good reason. A diagnostic procedure to ensure the surgeons don’t resect the wrong hippocampus when considering surgery for patients with epilepsy is something most of us would consider an extremely good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mormann’s team, and a small number of other research groups, study the firing of individual neurons by inserting fine microwires inside the hollow tube of the depth electrodes that have to be implanted anyway in order to diagnose the location of a patient's seizures in hopes of curing their epilepsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, shortly after single neuron recordings started to be used by scientists to take advantage of this rare opportunity to engage in ethical neurological research in human beings, Dr. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, who now heads up the Neural Mechanisms of Perception and Memory Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute in Barcelona, showed that individual neurons could be extremely selective, with a single neuron firing predictably in response to images of a single animal, individual or place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twenty years ago … I was doing experiments with a patient, and then I showed many pictures of Jennifer Aniston, and I found a neuron that responded only to her and to nothing else,” Quian Quiroga told Salon in a video interview. "And as I found this one, I found many others later on, and basically it was very clear that in an area called the hippocampus that is known to be critical for memory, we have neurons that represent, in this case, specific people, or in general, specific concepts. It can be a person, it can be an object, it can be a place — whatever is relevant to the person or to the patient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that first work, described in 2005, UCLA neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried, Quian Quiroga, then his mentee, and other colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03687" target="_blank"&gt;showed that a subset of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampal formation, and more generally, in an area of the brain called the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that includes the hippocampus, fire in response to the subjects being shown pictures of a particular person under strikingly different conditions: at different ages, poses or contexts. A given neuron would even fire in response to reading the person’s name. Confusion is possible: for example, a Jennifer Aniston neuron might fire if you show the subject a picture of Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe on "Friends" alongside Aniston’s Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody expected that this neuron type could exist but we show very clearly that they do exist,” Quian Quiroga said. They dubbed these brain cells Jennifer Aniston neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you call them, these neurons have not yet been found in rats, nor in monkeys, nor in any other mammal or organism — only in humans, despite Quian Quiroga challenging anyone, anywhere to find another creature with concept cells. But in the last two decades, no one has found them in anyone but humans, where they are reliably easy to find by testing neurons at random in the MTL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief history of concept cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quian Quiroga’s team and others, like Mormann’s, conducted further studies that gradually revealed different properties of concept neurons in the MTL, primarily in the hippocampus, and how they behave in different conditions. Semantic concept neurons have also been found in different parts of the MTL, such as the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex. Recently, Mormann and his team identified smell-specific &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/15/smell-and-sight-are-closer-friends-than-we-realized/"&gt;concept cells in the piriform cortex, which they dubbed olfactory concept cells&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, of 1,856 neurons tested in the piriform cortex in that study, 66 responded to both images and odors, meaning that they had semantic invariance with respect to the concept of the odor in question, firing in response to an image associated with the smell as well as the smell itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts encoded by concept neurons can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3505687/"&gt;an animal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6564037/"&gt;an article of clothing&lt;/a&gt;, a place, or a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19631538/"&gt;person&lt;/a&gt;. The concept can be evoked, and the associated neuron made to fire, by a direct stimulus such as seeing the person or hearing their voice; or without a stimulus, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11099042/"&gt;imagery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2650423/"&gt;free recall&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8545952/"&gt;comparisons&lt;/a&gt; that reference the concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We show explicitly that [concept cells are] involved in forming and storing memories,” Quian Quiroga explained. “We had a series of experiments [where] we showed that these neurons are involved in the forming of memories, and they can do this very quickly. I mean, in just one shot, they can change the way they respond, and with this, they are encoding new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further argued that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3251"&gt;concept cells were fundamental components&lt;/a&gt;, or building blocks, of declarative memory. It’s not surprising, he felt, that we have neurons responding to concepts in an area of the brain associated with memory — after all, we do tend to remember concepts and forget details. The human way of remembering is very abstract. Most of us don’t remember precisely what a person looks like, what they are wearing, or the words they say in a conversation; rather, we focus more on the basic ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors (including Mormann) of a 2020 study of &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000290"&gt;how single neurons in the MTL are able to code abstract meaning&lt;/a&gt; write, “Although semantic abstraction is efficient and may facilitate generalization of knowledge to novel situations, it comes at the cost of a loss of detail and may be central to the generation of false memories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that cost may well be the price of human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I started arguing,” Quian Quiroga recalled, “that this is a trait of human intelligence, and … one of the key aspects that distinguishes us from other animals: the fact that we just don’t focus on details, but we’re able to extract what is the important information and focus on that. And this is the way we store our memories, and this is the way we think so we are not bombarded with details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For humans, unlike our fellow animals, we just want the key point, the essential abstraction. That, Quian Quiroga maintains, is the way we remember, and the way we think. And that’s what he shows with the new study, published in Cell Reports. The research team recorded the activity of individual neurons while patients learned and then recalled two stories that described different situations but featured the same character or place. Nearly all of the neurons that fired initially did so without regard to the context, such that, as the authors explain, “taking all neurons together it is possible to decode the person/place being depicted in each story, but not the particular story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain cells that fire during learning and memory are firing in response to the concept of that character and will fire in any context in which that concept features. Quian Quiroga believes that the development of language involved adaptation of neurons, common to all mammals, to this specialized purpose. Still, we don't know exactly when this arose, but perhaps it evolved gradually, Quian Quiroga theorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think in the last 100,000 years, the moment that &lt;em&gt;[Homo] sapiens&lt;/em&gt; started uttering words and attributing meaning to things in terms of words,” Quian Quiroga said. "Then the &lt;em&gt;sapiens&lt;/em&gt; started thinking in terms of words instead of pictures. I think that created the big phase transition of intelligence, the fact that we started thinking in terms of words. I think this created concept cells, because once you attribute the word into something then you get completely rid of the details. And that’s exactly what concept cells do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new frontier in neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The striking thing that also since 2005 has gone largely ignored [by] rodent electrophysiologists is that this degree of semantic invariance, plus also context independence, is something we observe only in the human. There’s no other species in the animal kingdom where this has been convincingly reported, and even in humans, we only find them in the medial temporal lobe and not any other brain region,” Mormann explained. “To me, [it’s] one of the most seminal discoveries of the last 50 years, at least, but has been largely ignored. And the reason why it’s been largely ignored is, in my opinion, because this type of electrophysiological research traditionally cannot be done in humans, for obvious ethical constraints.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we've seen, there is one very particular circumstance in which it’s necessary to carry out such invasive procedures. Patients with seizures as a result of epilepsy may require exploratory surgery — invasive seizure diagnostics, it’s called — to determine if they would be good candidates for a neurosurgical resection where the seizure-generating area of the brain would be removed, taking away the condition and any neurological or cognitive deficits associated with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think there’s a paradigm shift involved in all this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to make sure that we found the seizure-generating area so that we can then provide the patient with three pieces of information. One, their chances of becoming permanently seizure-free if we resect that area of the brain, which reflects how certain we are that we’ve identified the epileptic focus. Two is what price they’ve got to pay, because there is often some residual function that might be gone once we remove [the epileptic tissue]. And the third one is the complication risk,” Mormann explained to Salon with evident care. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/12/17/8_horrific_cures_for_mental_illness_through_the_ages_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;The history of lobotomy is such&lt;/a&gt; that no one would want to be associated with reckless brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small proportion of this group of epilepsy patients, less than 10%, recording seizures using scalp EEG is enough to provide the necessary information. But in cases where they cannot reach a conclusion on those risks and benefits non-invasively, his team offers the patients diagnostic surgery in which they implant electrodes and use them to record seizures exactly where they are happening. The implants may be in for a week or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The area that is being implanted the most [or used to be] is the medial temporal lobe, simply because it’s very well-shielded from the outside on both sides, and also because that is the region that’s mandatory for episodic memory formation,” Mormann said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Molaison — known for decades only as H.M. — became one of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649674/"&gt;most famous patients in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; after losing his ability to form memories entirely in 1953. That incident, so unfortunate for him and so interesting for our understanding of memory, occurred due to a bilateral resection to control epileptic seizures that had blighted his life since the age of 10, possibly resulting from a minor bicycle accident. To say he had a bilateral resection means that the surgeons removed these structures on both hemispheres of the brain. The surgery was successful at curing the epilepsy, but left him with the inability to form new memories. (Interestingly, attempts to replicate the effects of Molaison’s surgery on memory in monkeys were unsuccessful at first, revealing that humans and monkeys use different parts of the brain for learning certain tasks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s safer to resect just one hemisphere. But if you choose the wrong one to remove, the patient will still have seizures, and now may have impaired memory as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is why … it has become customary to be careful not to resect the wrong hippocampus, because simply, there’s no second attempt,” Mormann explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Mormann believes, the research in humans has been largely ignored. In his view, semantic concept cells in humans are thought of as “a fancy version of place cells” at best. Place cells are cells found, so far, only in rodents, that fire at certain spots as a mouse or rat moves through a linear track, indicating a cell specific to certain locations. (As &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52295-5?fromPaywallRec=false"&gt;Mormann’s own recent research&lt;/a&gt; has affirmed, humans do also have location-specific neurons that play similarly specialized roles in spatial awareness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a paradigm shift involved in all this,” said Quian Quiroga. While colleagues have been teaching his work to undergraduates for years now, “there might be some inertia not to take this paradigm shift because … we assume that the human brain is kind of like an extrapolated version of the workings of the animal brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that neuroscientists, have described certain principles in animal models, "assume that these principles will also apply to humans, although maybe with a bit of a higher complexity. And I think what we’re showing is that … we shouldn’t take this for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that this invalidates the use of animal models in neurology. But it means that, rather than expecting a rat’s brain or a monkey’s brain to tell us all about how things work in humans, the differences between their brains and ours may be what’s really of interest. In fact, Quian Quiroga is busy with experiments aimed at quantifying the differences between the way humans process information in the hippocampus or in the memory system in general compared to what’s been described over the last fifty years of memory research using other animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This paper we just published is the first that I expect to be a series of studies because this is just showing the tip of the iceberg,” Quian Quiroga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What concept cells could mean for AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all those years of focus on mouse and monkey brains as models for how we think have also informed our work in artificial intelligence. Might this explain why, impressive though it is, we have not yet replicated the way humans really think? It wasn't until 2020, after fifteen years of experimental evidence supporting the existence of concept cells, that three researchers writing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64466-7" target="_blank"&gt;in Scientific Reports set out a theoretical justification&lt;/a&gt; for the possibility of such structures existing, and in fact for the likelihood of the existence of such cells in the hippocampus. "Three fundamental conditions, fulfilled by the human brain, ensure high cognitive functionality of single cells," the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now though, it was the very different, prevailing understanding of the brain that has guided our development of artificial brains: that the coordinated action of countless neurons — a neural network — is what allows for the representation of abstract concepts. Although of course we do use a distributed neural network for many aspects of our cognition, now it seems that representing entire concepts using specific cells with semantic invariance might be a key difference between human intelligence and that of other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps also of interest to those hoping to build artificial brains, what Quian Quiroga’s work suggests is a possible explanation for how it is that anatomically, the brain of a human and that of a chimpanzee is not all that different. The human’s is bigger, but not so much as to explain the very considerable difference in intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my point is not that the human brain is different,” Quian Quiroga said. “It’s that the human brain must be working differently. It is just the fact that in the chimpanzee brain, you will have a visual stimulus going all the way from visual processing areas into your memory system. So you form memories based on pictures, based on images. In the human brain, the visual system comes to a point, and then you extract a meaning from it, and it’s only the meaning and not the stimulus itself that goes into the memory system”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our anatomy has barely changed from our common ancestor with chimpanzees. But language, it seems, has drastically changed how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucuma, a South American fruit known for its caramel-like flavor, is gaining popularity as a lower-calorie, antioxidant-rich alternative to sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucuma contains fiber, polyphenols, and carotenoids, which may support blood sugar regulation and heart health and help reduce oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typically sold as a powder, lucuma can be added to coffee, oatmeal, smoothies, and baked goods, but it’s less sweet than sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat healthier, you might want to steer clear of added sugars. (These are sugars that food manufacturers add to products to enhance flavor or prolong shelf life, according to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,%2C%22%20says%20Dr.%20Hu." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;.) Consuming a diet high in added sugars can raise your &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.603653/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; of dying from heart disease, increase the chances of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6868459/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; Type 2 diabetes or certain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29801420/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar#cellular-aging" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;accelerate&lt;/a&gt; cellular aging. So if you want to live a longer, healthier life, replacing your regular cane sugar may be one of your best options. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s where alternative sweeteners — including everything from stevia, monk fruit, agave, and more — come in. Most can be found at your local grocery or health food store and are available in powder, crystal, or liquid form. But one you might not be familiar with is lucuma, a fruit from South America that resembles an orange avocado — and may offer just as many health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma, as a recent &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/aabc/a/j4sYFSQQYNXPwWBLjTnQZLH/#" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows, had “significant amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.” Additionally, the research found that lucuma’s “fatty acid profile was also favorable, with a high percentage of α-linolenic acid, which is associated with numerous health benefits.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  So what, exactly, is lucuma — and should it take the place of sugar in your daily coffee? Here’s everything that researchers know so far about this potential superfood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-lucuma-and-where-does-it-come-from"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is lucuma and where does it come from? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma is a fruit that grows on the lucuma tree, which is native to the Andean valleys of Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. Commonly referred to as the “Gold of the Incas” because of its bright yellow-orange color, lucuma was important to the Incas, who considered it to be a symbol of longevity and fertility. Today, it is still used in Peru, particularly in ice cream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When ripe, lucuma’s flesh is starchy and sweet, with a flavor often likened to caramel, sweet potato, and maple syrup. The fruit is oval-shaped, with a pointed tip and a pit in the middle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fruit typically &lt;a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.43724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;isn’t eaten raw&lt;/a&gt; due to its mealy texture, which is similar to a hard-boiled egg yolk. As a result, lucuma is dried and ground into a powder, which is available for purchase at health stores, organic markets, and online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-which-compounds-and-antioxidants-does-lucuma-contain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Which compounds and antioxidants does lucuma contain? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2174668/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), one tablespoon of lucuma powder contains: 30 calories, one gram of protein, zero grams of fat, six grams of carbohydrates, three grams of total sugars, and two grams of fiber. This can be compared to table sugar, which &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/food/white-sugar/1-tbsp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; 49 calories, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of protein per tablespoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma is also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8434328/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich&lt;/a&gt; in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols and carotenoids, says &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani,&lt;/a&gt; MS, RD, CSSD, a sports dietitian. These carotenoids (which give the fruit its distinctive yellow-orange hue) support healthy vision, while its polyphenols and vitamin C content provide protection against diseases, Ehsani notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, these antioxidants help combat oxidative stress in the body, according to &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, a nutrition and wellness expert, founder of &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/membership/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sam’s Plate&lt;/a&gt;, and co-author of the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Shock-Hidden-Smart-Swaps/dp/1950785009" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oxidative stress occurs when you take in fewer antioxidants than your body produces and can contribute to conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oxidative stress destabilizes our cells, leaving them prone to damage that can promote chronic inflammation and diseases like cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disease,” Cassetty says. “So, eating antioxidant-rich foods is a great way to help prevent oxidative stress.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, lucuma powder’s fiber content helps support digestive and gut health, Cassetty notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-reported-benefits-of-lucuma"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What are the reported benefits of lucuma? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lucuma fruit contains the most potential health benefits, the powder has “still been shown to retain strong antioxidant activity, indicating that lucuma may provide health benefits even in certain processed forms,” says Scott Keatley, RD, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma powder is rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids, which support vision, immune function, and skin health, Keatley explains. The fruit also provides vitamin C, iron, zinc, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber, per Keatley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma has also been linked to a few health benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It offers some level of nutrition &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many sweeteners are non-nutritive, meaning they don’t provide anything in the nutrition department, but lucuma powder is different. “Unlike refined sugar, lucuma retains fiber, vitamins, and minerals, offering more than just empty calories,” Keatley says. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It may regulate blood sugar levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2009 test-tube &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19459727/#full-view-affiliation-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that lucuma may help prevent the actions of alpha-glucosidase, a gut enzyme that aids in breaking down sugars. By inhibiting this enzyme's function, lucuma could theoretically help reduce spikes in blood glucose levels after meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some researchers have also suggested that lucuma has a low glycemic index, which ranks foods from one to 100 based on how quickly they raise blood sugar levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/low-glycemic-index-diet/art-20048478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt; However, additional studies on the nutritional content of lucuma are needed to confirm this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It may help tamp down on bodily inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Added sugar is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9471313/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; for contributing to bodily inflammation, which is linked to a host of serious diseases like heart disease and cancer. But the antioxidants in lucuma may help reduce inflammation, Keatley says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It may promote heart health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The same study suggests that lucuma may inhibit the action of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays a role in regulating blood pressure. Excessive ACE activity is associated with hypertension and heart failure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/ace-inhibitors/art-20047480#:~:text=These%20medicines%20are%20commonly%20used,arteries%20to%20lower%20blood%20pressure." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. This research suggests that lucuma could function like an ACE inhibitor, although further studies are necessary to verify these findings in humans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, scientific research on lucuma is quite limited, notes &lt;a href="https://www.kristiblackburn.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stephanie Crabtree&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, a holistic registered dietitian specializing in gut health, hormone balance, and whole food nutrition — so approach these findings with caution. “Most studies available are small, preliminary, or conducted in laboratory settings rather than human trials,” Crabtree says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-lucuma-more-nutritious-than-other-sweeteners"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is lucuma more nutritious than other sweeteners? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s true that lucuma has fewer calories and carbohydrates than cane sugar, agave, honey, or maple syrup. However, it has more calories and carbs than stevia, sucralose (Splenda), or saccharin (Sweet ‘N Low), but it also offers more fiber and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re seeking fiber and antioxidants, Cassetty recommends traditional fruits and vegetables. “I don’t suggest using a sweetener for the purpose of getting a nutritional boost, but it’s a nice perk when you’re choosing a sweetener,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And, like any other sweetener, you shouldn’t go overboard. “Remember that it still contains calories and carbohydrates, which is especially important to consider if you’re watching your carb count, say, if you have diabetes or prediabetes,” Cassetty says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, if you have any fruit allergies or gastrointestinal issues, Cassetty says to exercise caution when trying lucuma for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-can-i-use-lucuma-as-a-sugar-substitute"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How can I use lucuma as a sugar substitute? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma can be added to anything you usually sweeten, such as oatmeal, tea, or coffee. The purée can serve as a pudding or custard base in baked goods, while lucuma powder may be mixed with flour in cake and muffin recipes or used as a thickening agent in soups and stews, says Vivian Villa, owner and chef at the food product development and consultancy company Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is that true? Are some activities better than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When Jennifer O’Brien, a psychologist who studies Alzheimer’s disease prevention at the University of South Florida, gives public lectures, she says she’s frequently asked if activities like crossword puzzles or word games will stave off age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s the No. 1 question,” she said. “There’s this very pervasive, common belief that if I do these types of games, it’s going to help me as I age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The truth, she and other experts said, is more complicated. The science on whether specific brain activities are helpful, or if some are more effective than others, is limited and hard to evaluate, and other aspects of your life may be more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But certain kinds of brain activities could, potentially, strengthen your cognitive skills as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4d916e3"&gt;What the Science Suggests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Very little research has been done on whether a specific brain stimulating activity, like a puzzle or a word game on its own, can affect memory loss. And the studies we do have are difficult to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
