      &lt;p&gt;WILLISTON, N.D. — North Dakota has reported its first case of measles in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated child from Williams County contracted the virus, likely during an out-of-state visit, according to a news release the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services issued Friday evening, May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The child has been isolated at home, HHS said, but the agency didn’t disclose the child’s name, age or condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS is contacting those who may have been exposed and advising unvaccinated individuals how long to quarantine,” the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a contagious viral illness that was once common among children. The virus can lead to serious and deadly symptoms in young children and those with compromised immune systems, HHS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a body-wide rash, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,” HHS Immunization Director Molly Howell said in a statement. “Vaccination remains the most effective defense against measles. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness. The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness spreads through the air and is contagious for several days before and after signs appear, HHS said. Most people recover after 10 days of being infected, according to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no specific medical treatment for measles, antibiotics may be used in cases that have a developed secondary bacterial infection,” North Dakota HHS said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, thanks to a “highly effective vaccination program” in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas has reported an outbreak, where more than two-thirds of the country’s 935 confirmed cases have been reported, the CDC reported Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70% of the cases were reported in patients 19 years old and younger, the CDC said. Three people have died and 121 have been hospitalized, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has, in general, questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. Last month, he said on the social media platform X that the MMR vaccine is the "most effective way to prevent the spread of measles."&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;North Dakota’s case is the first reported since 2011. Minnesota reported its 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/health/doctor-urges-residents-to-check-measles-vaccination-status-after-confirmed-case-in-minnesota" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;first case of the year in March.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota has a high vaccination rate, with 81% among toddlers and 90% in kindergarten students, according to North Dakota HHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities,” HHS said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state said two doses of the MMR vaccine is 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“The vaccine is routinely recommended for children at 12-15 months of age and again between 4-6 years,” the release said. “Most adults born in 1957 or later should have at least one documented dose. People born before 1957 are assumed to be immune due to the history of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state advised families and patients to consult with health care providers on the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't want to miss work," he told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: "It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is even wide variety within the same species – antivenom made from snakes in India &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97501-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is less effective&lt;/a&gt; against the same species in Sri Lanka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jacob Glanville Tim Friede in a lab coat stands in the middle of a busy laboratory where four other researchers are working" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Jacob Glanville&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Tim Friede, centre, wanted to help develop better therapies for snakebite victims&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research focused on elapids – one of the two families of venomous snakes – such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet.

They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is "unparalleled" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it "likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jacob Glanville Two scientists wearing white lab coats and black gloves are pipetting into small vials in a laboratory " class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Jacob Glanville&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Researchers working on developing a universal antivenom&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The other class of snake – the vipers – rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes," said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition," said Prof Kwong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was "certainly novel" and provided "a strong piece of evidence" that this was a feasible approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he cautioned there was "much work to do" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage "makes me feel good".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me.

			&lt;p&gt;Our eyes could potentially be coaxed into a special repair mode above and beyond our natural self-healing abilities, according to a new study, thanks to the delivery of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="159321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that trigger nerve cell regeneration &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"&gt;in the retina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean research team says the treatment offers hope for restoring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-link-found-between-gut-bacteria-and-vision-loss"&gt;lost vision&lt;/a&gt; that otherwise can't be brought back. For now though, it's only been tested in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works: a compound &lt;span&gt;antibody&lt;/span&gt; drug is used to block the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROX1"&gt;prospero homeobox protein 1&lt;/a&gt; (Prox1). This protein isn't inherently bad, playing an important role in cell regulation, but it appears to stop retinal nerves from regenerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Prox1 seeps into retina nerve support cells called Müller glia (MG) cells after damage occurs, interfering with their regenerative powers. We know MG cells are responsible &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44142-w"&gt;for self-healing retinal nerve cells in zebrafish&lt;/a&gt;, but in mammals, Prox1 acts as an MG blocker – which this treatment removes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Individuals with retinal degenerative diseases struggle to restore vision due to the inability to regenerate retinal cells," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58290-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike cold-blooded vertebrates, mammals lack MG-mediated retinal regeneration, indicating the limited regenerative capacity of mammalian MG."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to successfully test their Prox1-blocking methods in lab experiments and &lt;a href="https://www.jax.org/why-the-mouse/model"&gt;mice models&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests the approach could work in human eyes as well, with some further development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the effects of keeping Prox1 in its place were shown to last for six months and beyond, making this the first successful long-term neural retina regeneration we've seen in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In mice, Prox1 in MG originates from neighboring retinal neurons via intercellular transfer," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58290-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers. "Blocking this transfer enables MG reprogramming into retinal progenitor cells in injured mouse retinas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159324" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Prox1Delete.jpg" alt="Removing Prox1" class="wp-image-159324 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Prox1Delete.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Prox1Delete-429x415.jpg 429w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Prox1Delete-600x580.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159324" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When Prox1 was kept out of Müller glia cells, they got a regenerative boost. (Lee et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly there's a lot more work to do before this can be tested on human subjects, but the research has identified a crucial biological reason why mammals can't regenerate cells in the eye – and shown that self-healing capabilities can be unlocked.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; could begin by 2028, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study links in with other research investigating how eye damage could be repaired: from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;activating retinal cells with lasers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cell-transplant-restores-vision-in-multiple-people"&gt;transplanting new stem cells into the eye&lt;/a&gt;, many different approaches are being looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to degenerative retinal diseases, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/a&gt;, we're talking about hundreds of millions of people who are affected worldwide. Once the vision is lost, it doesn't come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also know that the world's population is getting older. These findings could have important implications for maintaining a good quality of life into old age – life without the vision loss that might otherwise happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to provide a solution for patients at risk of blindness who currently lack proper treatment options," &lt;a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/newsen/html/news/?mode=V&amp;amp;mng_no=45350&amp;amp;skey=department&amp;amp;sval=Department+of+Biological+Science&amp;amp;list_s_date=&amp;amp;list_e_date=&amp;amp;GotoPage=1"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Eun Jung Lee, biologist at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58290-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests swapping high-carb snacks with tree nuts for health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who snacked on nuts experienced changes that suggest a reduction in abdominal fat over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To keep the sodium levels in check, opt for unsalted raw or roasted nuts when you snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat—also called abdominal or belly fat—is necessary to help cushion your organs. But when there’s too much of it, it can increase your risk for metabolic syndrome, a condition that increases your risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is a cluster of other conditions, including larger waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, high blood sugars and low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol. Metabolic syndrome is defined as having three or more of these conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While metabolic syndrome used to be primarily found in the older population, rates have steadily climbed in younger people. There is evidence that 1 in 5 young adults in the U.S. now has metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that there are many things you can do to lower your risk. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacking-on-nuts-may-reduce-risk-of-metabolic-syndrome-8414725" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on Vanderbilt University Medical Center research that suggested swapping high-carbohydrate snacks with nuts helped reduce abdominal fat. These same researchers wanted to dig deeper and look at the “why” behind these results. They published their findings in May 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited 84 adults, aged 22 to 36, with one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors. Those factors include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Waist circumference ≥89 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HDL cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL for men or ≤50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fasting blood glucose levels ≥100 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood pressure &amp;gt;130/85 mm Hg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood triglycerides ≥128 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before the trial officially began, there was a two-week run-in period. That was done so that all participants could start on the same playing field regarding diet. Participants received nutrition counseling and recommendations based on the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as well as a daily supply of high-carbohydrate snacks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They were also instructed to avoid all types of nuts and nut butters during this time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the run-in period, participants were randomly divided into two groups, which were evenly distributed based on BMI so that each group contained about an equal number of those in the “normal” BMI and “overweight” BMI categories. One group was assigned tree nuts as snacks; the other group was assigned high-carb snacks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The nut group was provided with two snacks each day, with each one including 33.5 grams of raw, unsalted tree nuts. The mixed nuts included almonds, walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pistachios and cashews. They ate slightly more than ¼ cup per snack, or about ½ cup of tree nuts per day. The high-carb snack group was provided with unsalted pretzels, animal crackers, graham crackers and some granola bars. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After the two-week run-in period and at the end of the study, participants had fasting bloodwork done, as well as abdominal subcutaneous (under the skin) adipose (fat) tissue aspirated with a small needle. Researchers analyzed the fat tissue for differences in gene expressions and fatty acid composition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why did they aspirate abdominal adipose tissue? Adipose tissue stores different types of fatty acids, which can be released into your bloodstream when your body is in need of an energy source. The types of fatty acids can change over time, depending on what you eat. Your genes within the fat tissue influence how the fat functions. These are those “whys” we mentioned earlier. The researchers wanted to understand why their first study showed a reduction in waist circumference in the nut group. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After statistical analyses were run, the results suggested that the nut group increased their total fat intake and had significant improvements in their saturated fat-to-unsaturated fat ratio. In particular, they saw increases in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat intake, while having no change in their saturated fat intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding the types of fatty acids stored in the abdominal adipose tissue, the nut group saw changes but they were not yet clinically significant. However, there were increases in oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fat, trending toward a more favorable ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats. Researchers note that the length of the study period—16 weeks—was most likely not long enough to see a remarkable change in stored fatty acids, but that this may have changed with a longer follow-up period.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there were no significant changes in the types of fats stored, there were noteworthy changes in the adipose tissue gene expression in the nut group—but not the high-carb snack group. Specifically, the various genes that showed increased expression in the nut group were those connected to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;breaking down fat cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;assisting HDL cholesterol in removing “bad” cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All of these factors help reduce metabolic syndrome and chronic disease risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study had several limitations. First, the small sample size reduces statistical power, since having more participants is almost always better where studies are concerned. Sixteen weeks may not have been long enough to see changes in abdominal fat. Lastly, self-reporting food diaries lend themselves to bias and inaccurate recollection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are loaded with brain- and heart-healthy fats, plant protein, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Eating them regularly has been linked to a healthier heart, brain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-better-blood-sugar-8713351" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels and weight.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key with choosing your nuts—besides picking ones you like—is to choose unsalted raw or dry-roasted nuts most of the time, as oil-roasting can add unnecessary fat to your nuts. If you prefer some salt, choose lightly salted. Even better, mix unsalted with lightly salted to get your taste buds used to less salt, since eating too much sodium is connected to increased blood pressure—which is the opposite of what you’re trying to accomplish by noshing on nuts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to remember that no one food or food category is a magic pill for weight loss or disease risk reduction. It takes a healthy-habit team effort. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-you-should-start-to-lose-visceral-fat-11698263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plants&lt;/a&gt; in general, which includes nuts, may help reduce abdominal fat. We’ve got meal plans specifically designed to help reduce abdominal fat, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058857/30-day-flat-belly-diet-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290676/7-day-flat-belly-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;seven-day plans&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat isn’t the only thing that can increase waist circumference. That bloating in your hands, face, feet and middle? It could be a result of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292274/5-weird-signs-youre-probably-eating-too-much-sodium/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating too much salt&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gas and bloating can also result from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/worst-foods-for-bloating-8739364" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating what is typically considered “healthy” foods&lt;/a&gt;, like broccoli, cauliflower and beans. Figure out which foods or sneaky additions to foods, like inulin and sugar alcohols—including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041560/is-chewing-gum-bad-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;those in gum&lt;/a&gt;—are causing the bloat and remove them for a while before slowly adding them back in to see how your body reacts. When in question, meet with a registered dietitian to help you figure it out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, a lack of sleep results in higher stress levels—and so the cycle goes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that swapping high-carb snacks with nuts may help stimulate genes stored in abdominal fat that influence factors related to metabolic syndrome, including how fat is used, levels of inflammation, cholesterol and immunity. Choose your favorite unsalted raw or dry-roasted nuts and use them as snacks or incorporate them into your meals. Toss some into your oatmeal or yogurt, use them in place of croutons on your salad or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248913/chocolate-nut-butter-bites/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pair nut butter with dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt; for a tasty, heart-healthy ending to a meal.

She listed the medicine in the caption and how her bloated lip was “one of the side effects” of Lisinopril. “I wish I could make this up. I can’t,” she said while shaking her head. The comments, nearly 20K of them, shared similar sentiments about the medication and how it’s “NOT for most of us Black folks and to “stop taking it ASAP.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;“The same thing happened to me when I was taking that medication. They need to take Lisinopril off the market,” one comment read. Others included, “I’m still traumatized from my allergic reaction to Lisinopril! That stuff will literally take our lives,” “Eastern medicine please 😩😩😩 cause Western ain’t it,” and “Lisinopril allergy is dangerous and can be fatal so beware.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Some folks in the comments reasoned SassyJ was having  an allergic reaction, and not a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Dr. Rubin, MD, a board certified allergist, stitched SassyJ’s video to explain exactly how something like that could happen. After apologizing to the woman, he explained how her lip swell is “not considered an allergic reaction because your immune system is not really involved with it the same way that you think of other types of allergic reactions.” He added: “This is considered a side effect for the following reason: Lisinopril [...] releases an enzyme that causes your blood vessels to get leaky. So when you take it... there’s an increased risk in some individuals for fluid to leak out of your blood vessels and cause swelling like that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;The side effect has seemingly been effecting Black people for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Back in October 2024, TikToker @VM posted a clip from a hospital bed with a swollen bottom lip. “Looky here, looky here. This is a side effect to the medication... this mostly impacts African Americans,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Rewind back to 2021, another TikToker described how she had been “taking Lisinopril for about a month. Started on 10mg, then 20mg, now I’m on 40mg,” before removing her mask and showing her fattened lip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Another social media user shared her experience online and how the doctor said her swollen lip “was getting worse. They gonna keep me here and they said I can’t eat nothing.” She documented herself being taken to the progressive care unit — which is one step below the intensive care unit (ICU) — and told viewers how “she’s in good spirits but this is nothing to play with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Aside from swollen lips, Dr. Nneka Anuligo, MD shared a TikTok of her own describing the “life threatening side effect of Lisinopril.” Because the drug can cause swelling of the “tongue, and sometimes the throat” that can “lead to closure of the airway.” She described how “it’s a rare side effect,” but “African Americans are five times more likely to have this side effect, however, it does not preclude African Americans from taking this excellent medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;AstraZeneca, the primary maker of Lisinopril, has addressed the side effects of their medication with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kMzRIQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/019777s064lbl.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/019777s064lbl.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;clear warnings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The NTS, a vital relay for signals from organs via the vagus nerve, plays a key role in emotion regulation and overall mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using D-PSCAN, scientists visualized how the NTS responds to vagus nerve stimulation and natural signals like the gut hormone cholecystokinin. This breakthrough could help optimize treatments like vagus nerve stimulation for depression and broaden our understanding of brain-body interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Deep-Brain Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; D-PSCAN enables minimally invasive, high-resolution imaging of the NTS in living animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Body Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The NTS integrates organ signals and plays a vital role in emotion regulation and mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could optimize vagus nerve stimulation and inform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The communication between the brain and bodily organs is fundamental to emotion regulation and overall mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the brainstem is a critical hub structure mediating this interaction via the vagus nerve.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study recently published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt; (April 4, 2025), the research team has developed the live NTS imaging method (named “D-PSCAN”, or Double-Prism-based brainStem imaging under Cerebellar Architecture and Neural circuits).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This novel deep-brain imaging technique enables high-resolution, minimally invasive visualization of the NTS neural activity in living mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Minimally Invasive Technique Unveiled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D-PSCAN method is based on the double microprism assembly carefully and systematically implanted between the cerebellum and brainstem, preserving cerebellar function while providing a broad and detailed view of the NTS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One major challenge in studying the NTS is its deep location beneath the cerebellum, which has made observation in living animals difficult.” explains lead author Masakazu Agetsuma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, some approaches involved removing the cerebellum to access the NTS, but this posed a major limitation: the cerebellum, major motor coordination center, has also been recognized as important for emotional regulation. Therefore, a method to observe the NTS while preserving cerebellar function has been needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed activity of the NTS can now be observed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team evaluated the D-PSCAN method by investigating the NTS’s response to the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, which conveys signals from internal organs to the NTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed the specific thresholds of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) intensity required to elicit neural responses in the NTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also observed that varying stimulation parameters causes distinct patterns of neural activation, including sensitization or, conversely, inhibitory effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been clinically used for drug-resistant epilepsy and is currently under investigation as a treatment for depression and other psychiatric and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results highlight the potential of the D-PSCAN method for gaining valuable insights into optimizing VNS parameters for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate NTS function under more physiological conditions than electrical stimulation, the research team applied the D-PSCAN method to examine its response to the gut hormone cholecystokinin, which is naturally released after feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, they successfully detected NTS neural activity evoked by cholecystokinin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future prospects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain-body interaction plays a critical role in emotion regulation, and gaining a deeper understanding of this function is expected to contribute both to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and to the advancement of mental health and well-being.” says Agetsuma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The D-PSCAN can offer a new approach to elucidate brain–body–mind interactions, and represents a valuable research tool for basic neuroscience to clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond the study of emotion regulation. The NTS receives input from various organs, including the heart and gut, and is involved in diverse functions such as appetite regulation, energy metabolism, and gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo NTS imaging technique developed in this study, D-PSCAN, is expected to be widely applied across these research areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4245425f01474347595f4d456c4245425f02465c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hayao KIMURA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nins.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NINS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hayao KIMURA – NINS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2025.101010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Minimally invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging of the brainstem at cellular resolution&lt;/a&gt;” by Masakazu Agetsuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimally invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging of the brainstem at cellular resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), a brainstem structure, is proposed as a critical gateway for regulating emotions through brain-viscera communication and for therapies based on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).

While visual processing has traditionally been viewed as mostly feedforward, this study shows that feedback from higher brain areas conveys prior knowledge and behavioral context to shape perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “top-down” information allows early visual neurons to shift their responsiveness moment by moment depending on the task at hand. These findings challenge classical models of visual processing and may have implications for understanding perception and brain disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Early visual neurons adapt rapidly based on task demands and prior experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher brain regions send contextual information to lower visual areas, guiding perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Autism:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding feedback mechanisms may shed light on perceptual differences in autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains begin to create internal representations of the world around us from the first moment we open our eyes. We perceptually assemble components of scenes into recognizable objects thanks to neurons in the visual cortex.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process occurs along the ventral visual cortical pathway, which extends from the primary visual cortex at the back of the brain to the temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s long been thought that specific neurons along this pathway handle specific types of information depending on where they are located, and that the dominant flow of visual information is feedforward, up a hierarchy of visual cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109434"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg" alt="This shows a Brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings are part of an increasing recognition of the importance and prevalence of feedback information flow in the visual cortex—and perhaps far beyond. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the reverse direction of cortical connections, often referred to as feedback, has long been known to exist, its functional role has been little understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research from the lab of Rockefeller University’s Charles D. Gilbert is revealing an important role for feedback along the visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his team demonstrates in a paper recently published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, this countercurrent stream carries so-called “top down” information across cortical areas that is informed by our prior encounters with an object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this flow is that neurons in this pathway aren’t fixed in their responsiveness but can adapt moment to moment to the information they’re receiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even at the first stages of object perception, the neurons are sensitive to much more complex visual stimuli than had previously been believed, and that capability is informed by feedback from higher cortical areas,” says Gilbert, head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilbert’s lab has investigated fundamental aspects of how information is represented in the brain for many years, primarily by studying the circuitry underlying visual perception and perceptual learning in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The classical view of this pathway proposes that neurons at its beginning can only perceive simple information such as a line segment, and that complexity increases the farther up the hierarchy you go until you reach the neurons that will only respond to a specific level of complexity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous findings from his lab indicate that this view may be incorrect. His group has, for example, found that the visual cortex is capable of altering its functional properties and circuitry, a quality known as plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in work done with his Rockefeller colleague (and Nobel Prize winner) Torsten N. Wiesel, Gilbert discovered long-range horizontal connections along cortical circuits, which enable neurons to link bits of information over much larger areas of the visual field than had been thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also documented that neurons can switch their inputs between those that are task relevant and those that are task irrelevant, underscoring the dexterity of their functional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the current study, we were trying to establish that these capabilities are part of our normal process of object recognition,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing is understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilbert’s lab spent several years studying a pair of macaques that had been trained in object recognition using images of a variety of objects the animals may or may not have had familiarity with, such as fruits, vegetables, tools, and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the animals learned to recognize these objects, the researchers monitored their brain activity using fMRI to identify which regions responded to the visual stimuli. (This method was pioneered by Gilbert’s Rockefeller colleague Winrich Freiwald, who has used it to identify regions of the brain that are responsive to faces.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then implanted electrode arrays, which enabled them to record the activity of individual nerve cells as the animals were shown images of the objects they’d been trained to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they were shown the full object, and other times a partial or tightly cropped image. Then they were shown a variety of different visual stimuli and indicated whether they found a match to the original object or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are called delayed match-to-sample tasks because there is a delay between when they see an object cue and when they are shown a second object or object component, to which they are trained to report whether the second image corresponds to the initial cue,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While they’re looking through all the visual stimuli to find a match, they have to use their working memory to keep in mind the original image.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that over a range of visual targets, a single neuron may be more responsive to one target, and with another cue, they’ll be more responsive to a different target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned these neurons are adaptive processors that change on a moment-to-moment basis, taking on different functions that are appropriate for the immediate behavioral context,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also demonstrated that the neurons found at the beginning of the pathway, thought to be limited to responding to simple visual information, were not actually so constrained in their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurons are sensitive to much more complex visual stimuli than had previously been believed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There doesn’t seem to be as large of a difference in terms of the degree of complexity represented in the early cortical areas relative to the higher cortical areas as previously thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings bolster what Gilbert believes is a novel view of cortical processing: that adult neurons do not have fixed functional properties but are instead dynamically tuned, changing their specificities with varying sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of cortical activity also revealed a potential functional role of reciprocal feedback connections in object recognition, where the flow of information from higher cortical areas to these lower ones contributes to their dynamic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that these so-called ‘top-down’ feedback connections convey information from areas of the visual cortex that represent previously stored information about the nature and identity of objects, which is acquired through experience and behavioral context,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sense, the higher-order cortical areas send an instruction to the lower areas to perform a particular calculation, and the return signal—the feedforward signal—is the result of that calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These interactions are likely to be operating continually as we recognize an object and, more broadly speaking, make visual sense of our surroundings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism research applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are part of an increasing recognition of the importance and prevalence of feedback information flow in the visual cortex—and perhaps far beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that top-down interactions are central to all brain functions, including other senses, motor control, and higher order cognitive functions, so understanding the cellular and circuit basis for these interactions could expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain disorders,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, his lab is beginning to investigate animal models of autism both at the behavioral and the imaging level. Will Snyder, a research specialist in Gilbert’s lab, will study perceptual differences between autism-model mice and their wild-type littermates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction, the lab will observe large neuronal populations in the animals’ brains as they engage in natural behaviors using the highly advanced neuroimaging technologies in the Elizabeth R. Miller Brain Observatory, an interdisciplinary research center located on Rockefeller’s campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to see if we can identify any perceptual differences between these two groups and the operation of cortical circuits that may underly these differences,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a212c2f24300a382529212f2c2f26262f38642f2e3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Fenz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rockefeller.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Fenz – Rockefeller University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2406684122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Expectation-dependent stimulus selectivity in the ventral visual cortical pathway&lt;/a&gt;” by Charles D.

&lt;p&gt;"Nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens are high in fiber, which promotes fullness and satiety," she said. "However, this is not a guaranteed way to reduce cravings or make your food choices healthier throughout the day."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Writing in English and Italian, she has contributed to national magazines and newspapers for over 30 years, as well as international publications. She also dedicates her writing to spreading awareness about living with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Parkinson’s is not an enjoyable experience for anyone, particularly when you’re young. It’s not something that’s predictable, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; began appearing in late 2021, when I was in my early 50s. That’s supposed to be an age when we’re still active and can take care of our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the onset of my Parkinson’s, I’d recently recovered from COVID-19 and thought the slight hand tremors I was having were a symptom of long COVID-19. I believed they’d eventually go away. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, and instead, they worsened, resulting in my terrible &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of a &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/services/spect-brain-datscan"&gt;Spect Brain DaTscan&lt;/a&gt;, a nuclear imaging test that allows doctors to look at brain function, were merciless: I had Parkinson’s disease at age 52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been an energetic and lively woman, adept at multitasking and balancing home and work duties. However, with the arrival of Parkinson’s, that abundance of energy abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most traumatic part about this condition is the total transformation of my daily routine, especially when it comes to taking care of my family, and my 80-year-old mother in particular. She is a widow and has relied on my help since we lost my beloved father to cancer over 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she aged, her care needs became more evident. She doesn’t drive, so before Parkinson’s appeared in my life, I was happy to take her to the local market or the cemetery to visit my dad’s grave. My car has always been a symbol of independence for me and a way to take care of my mom. But Parkinson’s deprived me of that important part of my independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my diagnosis, I haven’t been able to drive. My mom doesn’t get out of the house often, and sometimes she’ll still ask me if I feel good enough to drive, which breaks my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m trying to encourage her by having a positive attitude about my health condition, even when my symptoms are obvious and they upset me. She’ll see me leaning on a wall and ask why I’m doing that. I’ll reply that I’m just exercising to strengthen my back. The truth is that I’m experiencing dizziness, vertigo, and leg weakness, but I don’t want her to know how severe my symptoms are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that can’t always be avoided. One time, my shoulder froze up and I couldn’t get out of bed or go to the bathroom. While my husband was at work, my mother helped care for me, which exhausted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get tired very quickly, so my husband helps out when he’s not working. Parkinson’s has turned our family’s relationship into a triangle of mutual support. I help my mom when she needs me, and my husband helps me when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s has changed my life forever. Every new symptom is a challenge. But I’ve learned that while Parkinson’s can change the way you move, it can’t change the way you love.&lt;/p&gt;

In approved medical applications, it is generally regarded as a safer sedative option for some patients, because it does not cause slow or labored breathing, Perrone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;But it also can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, similar to what Perrone and her colleagues were seeing in their ERs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;The rapid rise of medetomidine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At three Philadelphia-area health systems, Perrone and other emergency room doctors collected data on patients who had experienced severe withdrawal symptoms that did not respond to standard treatment options for opioid and xylazine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Their findings were featured in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7415a1.htm?s_cid=mm7415a1_w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7415a1.htm?s_cid=mm7415a1_w"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, along with reports on the drug from Chicago and Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Philadelphia, the study authors noted, 72% of illicit opioids tested contained medetomidine by the last four months of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The rise was stunningly rapid: Last May, Philadelphia health officials issued an alert about medetomidine based on the first &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/medetomidine-nitazenes-philadelphia-drug-overdoses-20240518.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/medetomidine-nitazenes-philadelphia-drug-overdoses-20240518.html"&gt;two positive tests of drug samples&lt;/a&gt; collected in the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Medetomidine’s spread follows efforts to crack down on xylazine, which just last year was found in 98% of fentanyl sold on the street. By the time of the study, it was detected in 31% of illicit opioids tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Perrone and her colleagues drew on data from 165 patients who visited Penn Medicine, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/topic/jefferson-health"&gt;Jefferson Health&lt;/a&gt;, and Temple Health between September 2024 and January 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In that time period, 91% of those patients required treatment in intensive care units because of their withdrawal symptoms, and 24% needed to be intubated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That was in part because the doctors found they could treat the severe withdrawal symptoms with a combination of drugs, including dexmedetomidine, that is permitted to be dispensed only in an ICU, Perrone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Over the course of the study, 137 patients were treated with dexmedetomidine, and all saw their withdrawal symptoms decrease. But the need for ICU treatment presents an additional challenge for treating patients in medetomidine withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“We don’t have a lot of capacity in the ICU,” Perrone said. “Usually, you don’t need to be in the ICU for opioid withdrawal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At one health system where Perrone and her colleagues gathered data, patients were tested for medetomidine and its byproducts as it exits the body. All patients with abnormal withdrawal symptoms treated there tested positive for the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Better drug testing at more hospitals could help doctors more quickly identify patients who need treatment for medetomidine withdrawal, Perrone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The CDC’s report presented Philadelphia’s experience alongside evidence from other big cities about the threat of medetomidine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Chicago, researchers outlined an overdose spike from medetomidine mixed with opioids, suspected to have sickened 178 people in a single week in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Pittsburgh, researchers looked at 23 cases of suspected medetomidine withdrawal at two hospitals between October 2024 and March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Inquirer.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 17:01:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQWmdtN3EySWl2SG9ycGp4TlVpMk9RLTZwYjJjNlBNRW9DY1NaYTdUbHFVdGp1VkwwLWprRzdhYWFiMVRtNGYtbVg1MFBCT0pLNE03T3RKMUxoR3oxUGFtZ2pwQS1BWlBmREJaS1dUcGdRR2tzY2FtaGhhMG5GcHRZRGNiVkVLRlJjb21Qd21GYjRoUUdwVDgtOUk4X2xYZlJKRURrLW9oRWZqVnBnOGRieQ</guid></item><item><title>我长大后被自杀念头所包围|心理健康视角-西雅图时报 | I grew up surrounded by suicidal ideation | Mental Health Perspectives - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOWVRpcTBONmdhdlRmVktJVXl5RXRlUnFWUFljT1RyRkN0aklvb3ZvVVZaVlRjRUltSTJ0cXdEVjA1LWxfb2dlbEVIVlJKVUNDYml3cHhueXcxOVVNNVV6SXJLcF80SkZHWE1YWXlzbUhiZDRBWXJfdWxsbTA5cEZpa3NuRm5CbUJUZHFLNUZ2NFh1RjdrZjNkcUFxZWczcFVraGRtWnNOUXNQWkRKUmVlV25rNHdqM3JhRVJ3Q2VDZ1VkQXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: This column focuses on suicide, self-harm and other topics related to psychiatric distress. If you or a loved one is in crisis, call 988. Additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/resources-for-mental-health-support/#one" class="content-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;resources are available here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my house growing up, suicidality hung in the closet like a cloak waiting to envelop any one of us at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first recollection of not wanting to be alive anymore came at the age of 4. This was two years after my parents lost a baby at 38 weeks to a congenital heart anomaly. My mother said over and over again that I was the reason she stayed alive and how she survived the grief of that event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, that sounded romantic, like it was out of a tragic love story. Love won, right? Later I realized she had been experiencing suicidality in the midst of her grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first suicide attempt was at 8 years old. At 10, I remember kneeling next to my father on the hallway floor as he cried out, wanting to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was before suicide prevention hotlines existed. We didn’t have crisis response teams besides police and firefighters. There were no crisis stabilization centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night when I was 13, my mother and I clung to each other in terror as my father left the house in distress. We had previously treated suicidal thoughts like the elephant in the room, but that night we both acknowledged we would be lucky if he came back alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, he didn’t make it home. He died in a fiery crash on a country road, killing himself and one other driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had not been able to keep my father alive; we didn’t have access to the resources, cognitive tools and emotional skills we needed to help him. My mother and I continued to cling to one another. It was just the two of us left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-component embed-container column-width-embed u-border-t u-border-b u-border-light-gray mv-40 pv-20"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times Mental Health Project features contributed essays from members of our community as part of our Mental Health Perspectives guest column. We invite individuals with personal stories related to mental health to share their experiences that reflect broader issues and concerns in the field. If you would like to inquire about submitting a column, please email &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="mailto:mentalhealth@seattletimes.com" class="content-link"&gt;mentalhealth@seattletimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without realizing it, I learned cognitive skills that can be lifesaving in suicide prevention efforts. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy uses a skill called behavior activation, where one makes a plan on a daily or weekly basis to choose activities that are meaningful, purposeful and enjoyable. I found meaning and purpose in dance and choir. Looking forward to Saturday morning rehearsals helped me through the grief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the excitement of growing up and becoming independent, I thought I could be free from the painful parts of my childhood. But that cloak in the closet followed me to college, then to graduate school and into parenthood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18376849-173282826" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18376849,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=300x209 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=1024x712 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=768x534 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=1536x1068 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=2048x1423 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=780x542 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=1020x709 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=1560x1084 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=2040x1418 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=375x261 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-3_132530.jpg?d=780x542","caption":"Jenne Alderks’ parents visit The Butchart Gardens in British Columbia in 1988.

Being uninsured at the time meant she went bankrupt. Her retirement savings went to medical bills. She was desperate to give up and begged me to let her die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not know how to help her, so I went back to what I knew. I begged her to stay alive for me the way she did after my brother died. Later I would learn about mental health first aid, a public health training that teaches people how to recognize and respond to mental health concerns in their loved ones and community members. The goal is to connect people who are struggling with care that will help them recover and heal. I wish more than anything that my mother could have accessed mental health care at that time so she could have recovered mentally and emotionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While listening to Seattle’s NPR station one day, I learned about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which are a variety of potentially traumatic experiences that occur in childhood. I began to have language for what I experienced and I learned the physiological response to chronic traumatic events leads to lifelong effects on health, opportunity and well-being. About 64% of adults have experienced one ACE, and 17% have experienced four or more types of ACEs, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aces/about/index.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I learned each of my children had also experienced passive thoughts of suicide, I realized we had to be more proactive in getting resources and support to break this intergenerational pattern. I was not about to let them inherit the cloak that hung in my parents’ closet and then in my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to a summer of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for each member of my family. DBT teaches skills to work through distressing thoughts and experiences, and it’s considered the gold standard for addressing self-injury and suicidal threats or attempts. People experiencing depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and substance abuse disorders are able to benefit from it, as my family can attest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My oldest qualified for residential treatment for depression and anxiety. My middle child participated in a community intensive outpatient program. The therapists for my spouse and our youngest child incorporated DBT skills into their therapy sessions. I participated in a virtual intensive outpatient program. This was all thanks to good insurance. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Finally, we were able to learn skills that could help us navigate life’s distressing events. We also learned how to navigate the levels of care available to our community: residential treatment, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient and regular visits to mental health providers in the community. This knowledge was lifesaving for most — but not all — of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though my mother was now insured, thanks to Medicare, the company providing her Medicare Advantage plan denied her access to the mental health care she needed, so she was unable to benefit from the level of care that was appropriate for her. In the middle of DBT summer, my mom died by suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBT skills became more necessary than ever before as we all struggled to bear her loss. Instead of the cloaks in the closet smothering us as they had long threatened to do, each of us now had a lifeline to cling to. &lt;/p&gt;

If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or have concerns about someone else who may be, call the 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

You will be routed to a local crisis center where professionals can talk you through a risk assessment and provide resources in your community.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more of the below signs that a person shows, the greater the risk of suicide.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Talking about wanting to die&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Looking for a way to kill oneself&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Talking about being a burden to others&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Acting anxious, agitated or recklessly&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sleeping too little or too much&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing or feeling isolated&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Displaying extreme mood swings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington state, more than 1,000 residents die by suicide every year, and adults who are 75 and older have the highest rates of suicide. Suicide is also the No. 2 cause of death for young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years; 20% of tenth grade students in Washington have seriously considered suicide, according to the &lt;a href="https://hiprc.org/outreach/suicide/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://intheforefront.org/suicide-prevention-and-older-adults/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trauma and grief of losing my mother led my family to become more aware of community resources for mental health. In my role as a council member for the city of Bothell, I was able to support the expansion of crisis response services, opening a crisis stabilization center serving North King County, and using American Rescue Plan Act funds for mental health services for residents lacking access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the implementation of the 988 suicide prevention hotline, North King County cities achieved something special. Community members in five cities now have access to the complete crisis continuum of care: someone to call, someone to respond, somewhere to go and someone to follow up. What was needed in my childhood was now a reality for my children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance plans still differ on how much mental health coverage they will provide, leaving many people like my mother in crisis without adequate follow-up care. This leads to increased strain on our public safety systems and contributes to less safety and well-being in our communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18376850-1886733972" class="st-image-gallery column-width-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"column-width-embed","images":[{"id":18376850,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=300x225 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=1024x768 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=768x576 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=1536x1152 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=2048x1536 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=780x585 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=1020x765 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=1560x1170 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=2040x1530 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=375x281 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04072025_Jenne_Alderks-4_132535.jpg?d=780x585","caption":"Bothell City Councilmember Amanda Dodd, Bothell Mayor Mason Thompson, Regional Crisis Response Agency Executive Director Brook Buettner and Bothell City Councilmember Jenne Alderks at a news conference announcing plans for a crisis stabilization center in Kirkland.

Appropriate care and treatment can interrupt the generational transmission of trauma and emotional dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, I want to live in a world where emotional regulation skills are taught to every person. Where mental health therapy is easy to afford and access, people who are struggling can get the levels of care they need to pull through and survive their challenges, and every friend and family member knows how to help their loved one navigate the mental health care services landscape.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota have completed a first-in-human clinical trial testing a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technique to help the immune system fight advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The results, recently &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147020452500083X" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/i&gt;, show encouraging signs of the safety and potential effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Despite many advances in understanding the genomic drivers and other factors causing cancer, with few exceptions, stage IV &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains a largely incurable disease," said Emil Lou, MD, Ph.D., a gastrointestinal oncologist with the University of Minnesota Medical School, Masonic Cancer Center and M Health Fairview, and clinical principal investigator for the trial. "This trial brings a new approach from our research labs into the clinic and shows potential for improving outcomes in patients with late-stage disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to modify a type of immune cell called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). By deactivating a gene called CISH, the researchers found that modified TILs were better able to recognize and attack &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment was tested in 12 highly metastatic, end-stage patients and found to be generally safe, with no &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serious+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; from the gene editing. Several patients in the trial saw the growth of their cancer halt, and one patient had a complete response, meaning that in this patient, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metastatic+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metastatic tumors&lt;/a&gt; disappeared over the course of several months and have not returned in over two years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We believe that CISH is a key factor preventing T cells from recognizing and eliminating tumors," said Branden Moriarity, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School, Masonic Cancer Center researcher and co-director of the Center for Genome Engineering. "Because it acts inside the cell, it couldn't be blocked using traditional methods, so we turned to CRISPR-based genetic engineering."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other cancer therapies that require ongoing doses, this gene edit is permanent and built into the T cells from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With our gene-editing approach, the checkpoint inhibition is accomplished in one step and is permanently hardwired into the T cells," said Beau Webber, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and Masonic Cancer Center researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team delivered more than 10 billion engineered TIL without &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adverse side effects&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating the feasibility of genetically engineering TIL without sacrificing the ability to grow them to large numbers in the lab in a clinically compliant environment, which has never been done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the process remains costly and complex. Efforts are underway to streamline production and better understand why the therapy worked so effectively in the patient with a complete response in order to improve the approach in future trials.&lt;/p&gt;

"Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), H5N1 is one of several influenza viruses that causes a highly infectious respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Infections in mammals, including humans, have also been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_120829814" id="div-vdoai-mid-120829814"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 influenza virus infection can cause a range of diseases in humans, from mild to severe and in some cases, it can even be fatal. Symptoms reported have primarily been respiratory, but conjunctivitis and other non-respiratory symptoms have also been reported.

Even though H5N1 is not easily transmitted between humans, its high mortality rate in human beings makes it a serious public health concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus, named after two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). While there are several subtypes (such as H1N1 or H3N2), H5N1 is particularly dangerous due to its potential to cause severe illness in both birds and humans. Classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, it spreads rapidly and can be lethal to birds, leading to major economic losses in the poultry industry and posing risks to food security in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mode of transmission of H5N1 virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus remains as an animal virus that primarily infects animals, according to WHO. The H5N1 virus is constantly evolving and could potentially become easily transmissible from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/kanye-west-reunites-with-wife-bianca-to-sue-dentist-for-making-him-addicted-to-nitrous-oxide/articleshow/120827689.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Kanye West reunites with wife Bianca to sue dentist for making him addicted to nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost all cases of H5N1 virus infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, for example live bird markets. There have been some instances of spread from infected mammals to humans as well. While there may have been some cases that were not detected, the virus does not seem to easily infect humans or spread from person to person, based on the current knowledge and understanding," according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of H5N1 virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms in humans range from typical flu-like signs (fever, cough, sore throat) to severe respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some patients have also experienced diarrhea, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Co-circulation of H5N1 viruses with swine or human seasonal influenza viruses, especially during the Northern hemisphere winter season, could lead to reassortant viruses that can efficiently spread in humans," the LANCET report warns. The CDC currently considers the virus to have a moderate future pandemic risk when compared to other Influenza A viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever (often high fever, &amp;gt; 38°C) and malaise, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and other non-respiratory symptoms. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurologic changes (altered mental status or seizures).H5N1 virus has also been detected in samples collected from people without symptoms who had exposure to infected animals or their environments," says WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/shein-ford-procter-gamble-and-more-full-list-of-american-companies-raising-prices-due-to-trumps-tariffs/articleshow/120824366.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Shein, Ford, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and more: Full list of American companies raising prices due to Trump's tariffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is H5N1 virus in humans treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza patients should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. Patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection with progressive, complicated or severe illness – or those with asymptomatic or mild disease but who are at increased risk of severe disease – should be treated with antiviral medicines, for example oseltamivir, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per WHO, as part of agency's influenza pandemic preparedness work, some countries have developed and licensed vaccines that could be used for avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. Currently, human infections of H5N1 are limited and vaccines are not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it safe to eat eggs, chicken and milk from areas with H5N1 outbreaks in animals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat products and eggs can be safely consumed, provided they are properly prepared. Please see the question "How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?” for detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from areas experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza is high-risk and should be avoided. Likewise, animals that are sick or have died unexpectedly should not be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the potential health risks to consumers, raw milk should be avoided. WHO advises consuming pasteurized milk. If pasteurized milk isn’t available, heating raw milk until it boils can also make it safer for consumption. Some of the guidelines issued by WHO are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep clean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;separate raw and cooked foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cook thoroughly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep food at safe temperatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;use safe water and raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GVN scientists were quoted as saying in the report, "In the US, sporadic human infections with no known contact with infected animals highlight the possibility of viral adaptation for efficient human-to-human transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals,” they continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我的婚姻和性生活被数百万人服用的常见药物毁了...请留意我的警告-每日邮报 | My marriage and sex life was ruined by common drug taken by millions... please heed my warning - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVF9MeTlMT05tUkdZZzJHWWNYZnF5dlJTeWZsbERETl9WaTVKUUtmTDZFNFE1MjRjWlpMWEU2SnFKOG9xS2p0eUpaOE5CWlNzQjJ0VDRVN0pYWlVmRHI1bjlxNGthbnpndmlGNzVjRHFGclRYbjlMakVSNGk4UDhBUlB2LU1acGdqSURCSDNhUVVEUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPZndNSzhLSlI4Z2tFMlJyMEJsUUJ3dVF6QnZOMnZZeTdBb0IyV2dfZXV3cEVmQmoxQ09XNV9jUzF0MUh6TldRMHNxRmNSdDRFSFBjdHJzLTNNLUNTNWotcHVVYzk0ZGpiRW9hcW9yd0JkUHA3ZE1jOWFjcGpfVFpmQ2tPTlZtYXdubXh1OXFQUnVJYUVRR2pF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thammika Songkaeo knew instantly her husband was the one when they met in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pair connected almost immediately and married two years later, welcoming a daughter into the world together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite how deep their emotional connection was, there was always one thought nagging away at Songkaeo: her husband was not that interested in sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they first met, her now ex-husband told Songkaeo how he had low libido and erectile dysfunction which he said started after taking&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14644175/genitals-mutilated-common-drug-warning-others.html"&gt; finasteride, a drug used by millions&lt;/a&gt; of men to prevent hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she dismissed his problems as 'something temporary'. When he struggled to perform in the bedroom, she got him to take Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing being labeled a 'sex addict', she avoided discussing it with friends — but quickly started to feel isolated, and became depressed, and then suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After seven years, she ended the relationship and filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14640391/FDA-effects-hair-loss-drug.html"&gt; sold by telehealth companies &lt;/a&gt;for as little as $30 for a month's supply, with doctors saying it can prevent hair loss with little more than a pill a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thammika Songkaeo has revealed how finasteride destroyed her marriage, saying it left her ex-husband with low libido and erectile dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug was originally developed for men with an enlarged prostate, but it has since become a popular hair loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2.6million men in the US take the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by blocking the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a compound thought to cause hair loss by shrinking hair follicles on the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But DHT is also crucial for sexual arousal, erectile function, and genital tissue health, and its reduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the drug shows a remarkable ability to promote hair growth, some men pay a steep price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some say the drug ruined their sex life, genitals and relationships — even long after they stopped taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo's husband was prescribed the drug by an unnamed health clinic and took it before they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe he was suffering from post-finasteride syndrome,&lt;span&gt; a condition of persistent sexual, neurological, physical and mental adverse reactions in patients after they take finasteride to treat hair loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her experience inspired her to write a book about a woman stuck in a marriage with an asexual husband in Singapore, titled: &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.penguin.sg/book/stamford-hospital/"&gt;Stamford Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. It was launched in the US on April 15 this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Songkaeo said her husband told her he was suffering from side effects of the drug after they became a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We noticed... that there was something off about the physical intimacy,' she said. 'There just wasn't the amount or intensity that there would be in my experience of a relationship.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She revealed the damage it had caused on the YouTube channel Moral Medicine, where patients who say they were harmed by finasteride publish their stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I thought it was something that could be overcome, as in I did not think it would be a lifelong thing — and from what I understood from my ex-partner there was no way for him to know if it would be a lifelong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought, "maybe it will be ok. Maybe what it is will be ok ". It turns out, it was not ok.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple met on the East Coast, and initially dated there before moving to Singapore together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said in an&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXnH0qZ30Y0&amp;amp;t=359s"&gt; interview with Moral Medicine &lt;/a&gt;— which raises awareness over harms caused by finasteride — that the couple tried Viagra to help with intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the birth of their daughter, she felt that what physical intimacy there was had now almost gone — and that there was just too little in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt extremely lonely at that point,' she told this website, 'I've never felt that kind of loneliness in my life and never knew loneliness like that could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like a loneliness that had no place on this Earth. It was very intense and harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And became like something that I could not live with, because it became very intense and harrowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Millich said that after taking finasteride his genitals shrunk, and he also suffered from serious mental health problems &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking to her husband about their differences, the pair decided to amicably end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said she experienced opposition from her family, who are from Thailand, when she revealed she was ending her marriage over intimacy problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since the relationship was resolved, she and her husband have remained best friends — and now happily co-parent their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would never, however, re-enter the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride works by blocking the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, which — according to the Cleveland Clinic — is typically found in the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About two to three percent of finasteride patients experience side effects, doctors say — with the most common being problems getting an erection, less interest in sex and problems with ejaculation, such as little or no semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors tend to tell patients that these will subside after they stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giving other women advice on how to handle the issue, she said: 'Letting compassion for both people guide the conversation leads to the best results. A conversation that is led by love and understanding for both people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really don't think that people who suffer from post finasteride syndrome should be treated as anything other than victims of a very dangerous drug in terms of the side effects it can give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, I don't think that any partner needs to endure the effects as if they were inconsequential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I think that if both parties arrive at the conversation and carry the conversation with love, care, respect and empathy... even the way the relationship dissolves can become a beautiful part of a couple or ex-couple relationship.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVF9MeTlMT05tUkdZZzJHWWNYZnF5dlJTeWZsbERETl9WaTVKUUtmTDZFNFE1MjRjWlpMWEU2SnFKOG9xS2p0eUpaOE5CWlNzQjJ0VDRVN0pYWlVmRHI1bjlxNGthbnpndmlGNzVjRHFGclRYbjlMakVSNGk4UDhBUlB2LU1acGdqSURCSDNhUVVEUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPZndNSzhLSlI4Z2tFMlJyMEJsUUJ3dVF6QnZOMnZZeTdBb0IyV2dfZXV3cEVmQmoxQ09XNV9jUzF0MUh6TldRMHNxRmNSdDRFSFBjdHJzLTNNLUNTNWotcHVVYzk0ZGpiRW9hcW9yd0JkUHA3ZE1jOWFjcGpfVFpmQ2tPTlZtYXdubXh1OXFQUnVJYUVRR2pF</guid></item><item><title>“我甚至不敢吃冰箱里的蔬菜” ：关注食品纯度的饮食失调--《卫报》 | ‘I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge’: the eating disorder that focuses on food purity - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNOXU5dFFkNUVDdXg4UklPenkwNjg4a1hfZmZ5ZW42QVpKcU5zajU2QWNJUmh3U0VoUmNxT1U1TmJ5TnAyZG9FWnZwSDNDNUVZYnhOTVpEemRfamdTVDh1ZXhPeTZxM21Oc0ZOb3NwZFJkYnk0NzhOWl9IUFJRNjg0NEkySWZZTDgz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Katie Lundgreen Urness’s struggles with disordered eating began when she was just 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A gymnast, she put a lot of value in being petite.

Urness’s hard-won recovery was driven by her dream of motherhood – she knew she wanted a baby and worried it “would suffer and not develop right because I was restricting food”, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Urness became pregnant at 25, her relationship with food was the healthiest it had ever been. Soon, TikTok and Instagram began serving her motherhood wellness content, even though she hadn’t searched for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One common theme was food purity. Posts warned against the “dangers” of common grocery items – that there was high-fructose corn syrup in most baby formula and harmful levels of pesticides in a box of cereal (&lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/high-fructose-corn-syrup-in-formula?utm_campaign=scarymommy&amp;amp;utm_content=TIMESTAMP_EPOCH&amp;amp;utm_medium=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=SOCIAL_NETWORK" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;both claims&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/no-your-cheerios-arent-filled-with" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been debunked&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another theme: the corrupt medical system. “The content is telling you not to trust your doctor, saying the system is outdated and vicious, misogynistic,” says Urness. She recalls creators claiming the &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/glucose-screening-tests-during-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glucose drink&lt;/a&gt; doctors administer as part of a test for gestational diabetes was “poison”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urness watched influencers who have been &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/the-congressional-american-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;critiqued by experts&lt;/a&gt; for exaggerating and misrepresenting health risks, including Courtney Swan, who has &lt;a href="https://x.com/realfoodology/status/1874882388674973942" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended a supplement&lt;/a&gt; to “detox the spike proteins” of the Covid vaccine; self-styled food-safety investigator Vani Hari, whom Vox called a “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8385295/science-reporting-ethics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peddler of pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;”; and siblings Casey and Calley Means, a physician and entrepreneur, the latter of whom &lt;a href="https://x.com/beardedhoosier_/status/1870992751841452350" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; “kids should be drinking more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/nov/26/what-is-unpasteurized-raw-milk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;” despite medical &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/29171/Raw-milk-products-can-cause-serious-illness-in?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; that it can contain pathogens linked to life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These creators have much in common: all encourage hypervigilance about supposed dietary threats, have publicly supported health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, and profit from the ideas they spread. Many food-purity creators benefit from ad revenue driven by their attention-grabbing claims or sales of products like supplements, diet books, colon cleanses or online courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There is a small grain of truth in some alarmist food content”, which helps it appeal to people’s sense of skepticism and caution, says Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian, author and host of the Rethinking Wellness podcast. “But it often gets blown up beyond all proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For instance, the American food industry engages in problematic practices, such as confined animal feeding operations and industry lobbying against regulations. “But in my many years of reading nutrition research, I’ve found that the rhetoric connecting food-industry practices to weight and human health is often overblown and not backed by sound science,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f9f25e7b-4711-4bb8-a6e8-4eeeba2e13ec" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What do we mean when we say women can be ‘too muscular’?

By the time she delivered her son in 2023, she was obsessively fixated on the healthfulness, safety and purity of food. “I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge” because of pesticides, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I thought it would be safer for me to risk going back to restrictive food patterns to protect myself and my breastfed baby from all these bad things,” says Urness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to experts, anxious preoccupation with the safety and purity of food is a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36436144/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;form of disordered eating&lt;/a&gt; called orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Orthorexia nervosa was coined in 1997 by an integrative physician named Steven Bratman,” says Harrison, the dietitian. “He was seeing a lot of obsessive thinking about food and nutrition in his patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Being mindful about food isn’t inherently disordered – many people want to eat healthily. By contrast, “orthorexia can be defined as an obsessive and extreme fixation on food, like purity of food, healthfulness of food, cleanliness,” Harrison says. “It’s a very common way people can be disordered about eating,” she says. Chemophobia, an irrational, broad distrust of chemicals based in misinformation, is another common symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nonetheless, orthorexia remains under the radar. It is not yet listed in psychiatric classification systems such as the DSM-5, and can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from basic health-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Orthorexia can present on a spectrum and be harmful regardless of severity, explains Harrison. Severe orthorexia presents as a level of obsessiveness that can “interfere with people’s lives”, disrupting major factors such as social relationships and work, she says. It can lead to nutritional deficiencies, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921564/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;co-occur&lt;/a&gt; with body dysmorphia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not just healthy eating. It takes over your entire brain,” says Urness, who still considers herself orthorexic, but is working on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that orthorexia is prevalent across genders, and that “the proportion of orthorexia nervosa symptoms seems to be increasing”. Men are more likely to frame restrictive eating around performance and fitness (think raw-meat diets and biohacking) and women around food-purity concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8a1d8d4c-1574-4dd0-b8b1-0c0f47cc684e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Orthorexia is politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.’&lt;/span&gt; Composite: Guardian/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Clinically significant orthorexia – cases where obsessive “healthy” eating causes impairment in daily life – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26902744/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; in research studies. But the current literature does not capture what’s happening right now, says Danielle Shine, an Australian registered dietitian and PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation in social media, who is working with several clients in recovery from orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Social media is causing more and more people to develop disordered beliefs and behaviors” around food, says Shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 49% of Instagram users who followed health food-oriented accounts displayed orthorexia symptoms. Since then, short-form video platforms including TikTok have risen in popularity, supercharging the reach of alarmist food-purity content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;llison Hume, 40, an elementary school teacher and mother of two in Ontario, found herself acutely anxious about her and her family’s health and safety after a difficult second birth during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While rocking my new baby, I spent hours on social media,” she said. In particular, she consumed information from Hari and Bobby Parrish. Parrish, a creator without formal nutritional qualifications, has been criticized by &lt;a href="https://labmuffin.com/parabens-fragrance-colorants-talc-debunking-bobby-parrishs-tiktok-misinformation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E8ileCrLlY&amp;amp;t=20s&amp;amp;ab_channel=AndresAyesta" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dietitians&lt;/a&gt; for spreading alarmist misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These creators “made me feel safe at the time, because their information was so black-and-white”, says Hume. “They would say: ‘Stop eating x, y and z and you won’t get cancer.’ It felt comforting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hari has a “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodbabe/p/CGa3UTtFoC5/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;no-no list&lt;/a&gt;” that includes many common ingredients generally recognized as safe when consumed in typical amounts, including natural flavors, emulsifiers and MSG. Many of these additives are found in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ultra-processed-foods" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which the National Institutes of Health generally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8217149/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; everyone to eat less of due to their frequently high fat, salt and sugar content. But seeing these additives framed as outright threats, Hume began to fear them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She tossed all foods containing these “no-no” ingredients, and shopped exclusively at high-end natural food markets. This doubled her grocery spending, “which was a big financial strain”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"My secret life as a model: ‘High fashion loved me most when I was visibly bony’","elementId":"f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/20/my-secret-life-as-a-model-high-fashion-loved-me-most-when-i-was-visibly-bony"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To check whether products contained forbidden additives, Hume used ingredient-scanning apps. If she had to purchase something “bad” because an approved item was unavailable, “it would be hard to sleep at night”, she says. “I really did think that our health was at stake if I didn’t follow these rules. The idea was that if we did get sick, it would be my fault and mine alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the time, she didn’t know there was a name for the obsessive, disordered thinking she was experiencing. “I was in denial that anything was wrong with me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But her family noticed huge mood changes. Hume became irritable and controlling. “I remember asking myself why everything was so hard,” she says. “Why aren’t other people following the same food rules? Why don’t they care about their health as much as I do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When she reflects on these habits now, Hume feels guilty. “It did end up affecting others around me as well, in particular my mom,” she says. “She also has a lot of health anxiety and it increased due to my influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, Hume is working with professionals to overcome orthorexia, and believes that content creators intentionally manipulate people like her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They are very aware of what they are doing. They are making a lot of money off vulnerable people like me … people like parents, the elderly and the chronically sick, and I really don’t think they care,” says Hume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the Covid-19 pandemic, trust in American health institutions has &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, creating fertile ground for wellness misinformation.

But Maha mom creators also spread misinformation; in one viral post, a creator falsely claimed that propylene glycol – used as a food additive in salad dressing – was the same as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEnZgFnvIR2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;antifreeze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The underlying message of much Maha food content is that mothers must try to cook from scratch as much as possible, not just because it’s tasty or pleasant to do so, but because food in the US is inherently “dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet according to the 2022 &lt;a href="https://impact.economist.com/sustainability/project/food-security-index/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Food Security Index&lt;/a&gt;, the US ranks third in global food-safety standards, behind Canada and Denmark. “We have an incredibly safe food supply in the US in general. Historically, the FDA has done a pretty good job of keeping us safe,” says Harrison. “And I’m no apologist for the food industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My issue with it is that they’re using food as a way to try to entrap women and give up certain types of political and economical power,” Dr Alex Ketchum, a professor at McGill University’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, whose work explores food and culture, says of Maha ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More domestic work means less time for community engagement, activism and ambitions. In her 1995 work Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, philosopher Susan Bordo describes dieting as a form of self-deprivation that aligns with broader cultural narratives requiring women to limit their presence in the public sphere, both physically, by being smaller, and socially, by conforming to restrictive ideals. For Bordo, this shrinking is less about weight than about diminishing women’s agency and visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c645cebf-4655-4c0d-9d49-f1f40098f932" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":49,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Ozempic is hailed as a miracle drug.

It is also politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Holding citizenry in fear and making them anxious around food in particular is one of the ways authoritarian or totalitarian leaders exert their power,” observes Dr Emily Contois, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy of the 1920s-40s, says Contois, food became a political tool used to reinforce women’s roles in the home. The regime relied on women as domestic caretakers – what Contois calls “home-front civic engineers”. Mothers were expected to make do with food shortages, masking policy failures with their sheer force of labor as the government failed to provide basic care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;avigating the medical system can be frustrating for people with chronic illnesses who don’t feel like they’re getting satisfying answers from their doctors. The idea of experimenting with alternative paths to relief, like “cleaning up” one’s diet, can feel like a matter of survival. But attempts to get better can spiral into a harmful place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Anna Zambreny, 29, a Maryland-based healthcare recruiter, says she has spent at least six years with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny cut out foods including gluten, dairy, eggs and meat while trying to heal various ailments, including eczema, Lyme disease and fatigue. The safest way to try eliminating food groups is with the help of a registered dietitian who can ensure adequate nutrition; Zambreny took advice from social media food-purity influencers and an allergist who recommended &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/wheat-belly-arguments-are-based-on-shaky-science-critics-say-1.2974214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientifically uncredible&lt;/a&gt; books like Dr William Davis’s Wheat Belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea that we weren’t being told the truth about food and that it was poisoning us started to affect my relationships. I didn’t really want to eat out … I didn’t really enjoy anything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny’s health symptoms progressed despite her efforts; now she reflects that many of them were likely rooted in self-inflicted malnourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I felt like everything I was eating could make or break my health,” she says. “I don’t think I was getting enough variety of food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Today, Zambreny feels angry and frustrated with the influencers she once trusted, some of whom she’s seen flip-flop on their messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They were vegan and then they’ve gone completely carnivore, or they were anti-medication and now they say getting on anxiety medication is the best thing that ever happened to them. And that feels very harmful to me because depending on when you tune into what they are talking about, it can really sway what you’re doing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It makes me mad,” says Zambreny. “It feels like they don’t actually care about changing health policy. It’s more like status they’re looking for … They’re so out of touch with the health advice most people need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny’s frustration may resonate at a moment when basic nutritional support is eroding, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-food-banks-warn-strain-republicans-seek-food-aid-cuts-2023-04-21/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hunger rates are climbing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=58350#:~:text=From%202020%20to%202024%2C%20the,percent%20over%20the%20same%20period." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;food prices are surging&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Trump has cut &lt;a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-admin-cuts-program-that-brought-local-food-to-school-cafeterias/2025/03" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$660m of funding&lt;/a&gt; for local produce in schools and childcare centres, and canceled another &lt;a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2025/04/02/food-banks--sudden-federal-cuts-threaten-our-ability-to-assist-new-yorkers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$500m&lt;/a&gt; in funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which helps food banks. He has also proposed reductions to the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), threatening universal free meal programs for children and the &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/data-tools/snap-cuts-state-county-gaps" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap)&lt;/a&gt;, which approximately 42 million people rely on for food essentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s this expectation that you are personally responsible for your own health,” says Contois – despite social determinants of health, such as physical environment, education access and economic status, being largely beyond individual control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fear-mongering around less urgent issues can distract people from more pressing health risks. “If you can make people afraid, you open the door for all sorts of policies to be possible,” says Contois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For instance, West Virginia recently banned &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/west-virginia-food-dye-ban" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;several food dyes&lt;/a&gt;.

Treatments for orthorexia include “challenging disordered beliefs about food, [dietitians] offering ‘meal support’ to help clients get through anxiety-producing meals and referring to a higher level of care if needed”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It has taken consistent hard work and patience, but Hume has “very few food fears” now. “I remember telling my psychotherapist that I ate a hot dog for the first time in three years,” she said. “I was very nervous about it, but boy, was it good!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Hume has already lost a lot to her food-purity obsession. “I always get teary-eyed when I think back to missing all the special memories I could have made with my newborn and my three-year-old,” she says. “I was so preoccupied with what I thought was keeping them ‘safe’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recovery from orthorexia isn’t only about personal healing. It also requires a cultural shift: access to safe, science-backed nutrition for all; investment in public health infrastructure; and a renewed commitment to care, trust and collective responsibility for our shared wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This isn’t a time to put up a fence and build a moat,” says Contois. “This is the time to build a longer table and invite other people into it.

Although mood improves post-recovery, hidden deficits in reward processing and decision-making linger, potentially contributing to relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using computational models, researchers found that these individuals tend to opt for low-effort choices in daily scenarios unless strong rewards are guaranteed. These insights could help develop targeted treatments aimed at enhancing motivation and sustaining recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Motivation Lingers:&lt;/strong&gt; Even after recovery, effortful choices are often avoided unless rewards are large and certain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relapse Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Persistent motivational deficits may increase vulnerability to depressive relapse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target for Treatm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research shows that individuals who have recovered from depression are generally less willing to exert effort to pursue potential rewards compared to those who have never experienced depression, unless the rewards are large and highly likely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;, published by Elsevier, provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining relapse vulnerability and guiding targeted treatment for sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have experienced depression in the past are often at a higher risk of experiencing another depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite improvements in mood after recovery from depression, they continue to exhibit some cognitive and motivational deficits, such as alterations in reward processing, impairing daily activities and functional recovery. The reasons behind this remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of the current study wanted to better understand the hidden processes in decision-making and motivation that might contribute to relapse vulnerability and identify ways to help people stay healthy after recovering from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Diego A. Pizzagalli, PhD, formerly Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, now Founding Director, Noel Drury, MD, Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior &amp;amp; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Noel Drury MD Endowed Chair, University of California at Irvine, says, ”Imagine an everyday scenario: deciding whether to meet a friend after work or simply stay home because going out feels too exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with a history of depression might more often opt for the less effortful choice—staying home—missing out on rewarding experiences and social interactions. Over time, repeatedly choosing the low-effort path could unintentionally reinforce behaviors or thought patterns that increase the risk of falling back into depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research entailed asking individuals who had previously experienced depression (but have recovered and are not currently using medication) and a group of participants who had never experienced depression to make a series of choices between low-effort tasks with smaller rewards and high-effort tasks with potentially larger rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given evidence that antidepressants can blunt reward-related neural processes, only unmedicated individuals with remitted major depressive disorder were included to minimize potential confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices were then analyzed using computational methods to understand motivation and decision-making. The most significant results showed that recovered individuals generally preferred less effortful options, but notably, they became equally or even more motivated than healthy individuals when rewards were large and highly certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that while motivation may be reduced in everyday tasks, providing clear and highly valuable incentives can effectively boost motivation in individuals with a history of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt; Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine, notes, “Reduced motivation is a core feature of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Utilizing the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task test, researchers examined how individuals weigh the potential benefits of rewards against the cognitive or physical effort required to obtain them, providing valuable insights into motivational processes underlying major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this study suggest a nuanced picture of decision-making in recovered depression, highlighting conditions under which motivation may actually surpass typical levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Manuel Kuhn, PhD, Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, concludes, “This research is novel because it applies advanced computational modeling techniques, allowing us to identify latent decision-making processes—such as how reward magnitude and effort cost are integrated—that conventional analytical methods have not yet been able to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important now, as it provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining their vulnerability to relapse triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By pinpointing these underlying motivational mechanisms, our findings can inform the development of more targeted treatments designed to enhance sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and motivation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a626779676f6e636b4a6f66796f7c636f7824696567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elsevier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Leahy – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Computational Phenotyping of Effort-Based Decision Making in Unmedicated Adults with Remitted Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego A.

Yet, the extent to which this deficit persists in remitted MDD (rMDD) remains unclear. Here, we examined effort-based decision making as one aspect of amotivation in rMDD using computational phenotyping to characterize decision-making processes and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmedicated adults with rMDD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40) and healthy control (HC) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 68) completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated-measures analysis of variance and computational modeling—including hierarchical drift diffusion modeling and subjective value modeling—were applied to quantify decision-making dynamics in effort allocation across different reward magnitudes and probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to HC participants, participants with rMDD made overall fewer hard task choices, with an attenuated effect when accounting for anhedonia. However, specific to high reward, high probability conditions, participants with rMDD chose to expend effort more often than HC participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was supported by the drift diffusion model results revealing that participants with rMDD showed a drift rate biased toward selecting the easy task, counteracted by heightened influence of reward probability and magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probed with the subjective value model, this was not driven by group differences in decision strategies with respect to magnitude and probability information use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these findings suggest that while individuals with rMDD exhibit persistent motivational deficits, they retain a heightened sensitivity to high-value rewards, requiring more substantial or certain rewards to engage in effortful tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern may reflect impairments in reward processing and effort-cost computations, contributing to motivational dysfunction. Targeting reward sensitivity and effort allocation could be valuable for interventions aimed at preventing MDD relapse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9xR3U3Z3I2Wm05Z0dvUmE1MlhILXlUNm0tNm1md2tRTUZKZTlNVXJ5TzhlaUc5emllTTgtcTVRcEJnM1lhZkVxSnFOc3BkcnUwajFQNk9Qa1loR1VQcHBMdjJCZUNtV09RNEdzd0otMG5BdWZkcDM0</guid></item><item><title>有些苍蝇会失眠以抵御寄生虫- Ars Technica | Some flies go insomniac to ward off parasites - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPUmdNSVZVb0pNNWNwQjUtblVxeGlYTWJTWGxYaUpaalI0UktFY01ISHFTREFLWEV0VzJyRldUYjJGM3V4SDl6cTFtYXJfRGpvSVQ0dlF5ZmRqWXM3UXE1WXBSV1hTRWdtbjdQSGlNMGdZQy0tT2htX1NqZTBwYmJRZnpHaWhSanNLTkFPV3VYVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those genes associated with metabolism were upregulated, meaning they showed an increase in activity. An observed loss of body fat and protein reserves was evidently a trade-off for resistance to mites. This suggests there was increased lipolysis, or the breakdown of fats, and proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins, in resistant lines of flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parasite paranoia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depletion of nutrients could make fruit flies less likely to survive even without mites feeding off them, but their tenaciousness when it comes to staying up through the night suggests that being parasitized by mites is still the greater risk. Because mite-resistant flies did not sleep, their oxygen consumption and activity also increased during the night to levels no different from those of control group flies during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping mites away involves moving around so the fly can buzz off if mites crawl too close. Knowing this, Benoit wanted to see what would happen if the resistant flies’ movement was restricted. It was doom. When the flies were restrained, the mite-resistant flies were as susceptible to mites as the controls. Activity alone was important for resisting mites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mites are ectoparasites, or external parasites (as opposed to internal parasites like tapeworms), potential hosts like flies can benefit from hypervigilance. Sleep is typically beneficial to a host invaded by an internal parasite because it increases the immune response. Unfortunately for the flies, sleeping would only make them an easy meal for mites. Keeping both &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/fruit-flies-have-super-resolution-stereo-vision#:~:text=The%20team%20discovered%20that%20flies,surroundings%20than%20previously%20thought%20possible"&gt;stereoscopic eyes&lt;/a&gt; out for an external parasite means there is no time left for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pattern of reduced sleep likely allows the flies to be more responsive during encounters with mites during the night,” the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44323-025-00031-7?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20250402&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038/s44323-025-00031-7"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in their study, which was recently published in Biological Timing and Sleep. “There could be differences in sleep occurring during the day, but these differences may be less important as &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;sleeps much less during the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies aren’t the only creatures with sleep patterns that parasites disrupt. Evidence of shifts in sleep and rest in birds and bats has been shown to happen when there is a risk of parasitism after dark. For the flies, exhaustion has the upside of better fertility if they manage to avoid bites, so a mate must be worth all those sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia, depression, and anxiety are the most common mental disorders. Treatments are often only moderately effective, with many people experiencing returning symptoms. This is why it is crucial to find new leads for treatments. Notably, these disorders overlap a lot, often occurring together. Could there be a shared brain mechanism behind this phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Siemon de Lange, Elleke Tissink, and Eus van Someren, together with their colleagues from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, investigated brain scans of more than 40,000 participants from the UK Biobank. The research is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00412-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissink says, "In our lab, we explore the similarities and differences between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insomnia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and depression. Everyone looks at this from a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/different+perspective/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;different perspective&lt;/a&gt;: some mainly look at genetics and in this study, we look at brain scans. What aspects are shared between the disorders, and what is unique to each one?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overlap and differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We investigated many different aspects, like the structure and connectivity of the brain tissue. In all three disorders, we observe a reduced surface area of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cerebral+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller thalamic volume, and weaker connectivity between different brain regions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, some abnormalities are unique to each disorder. For example, the severity of insomnia appears to be more closely related to smaller volumes in the brain areas associated with reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The severity of depression, on the other hand, seems to be more strongly related to a thinner cerebral cortex in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain areas&lt;/a&gt; associated with language and emotion. Instead, anxiety is more severe with weaker amygdala reactivity and functional connectivity between regions where dopamine, glutamate, and histamine play a crucial role in communication."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Similar brain circuit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can we ultimately do with this information? Tissink continues, "The regions seem separate from each other, but when you map them out together, they all turn out to be part of the same circuit (amygdala–hippocampus–medial prefrontal cortex circuit). So, even though they are distinct areas, they all appear to represent different pieces of vulnerability within the same puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A lot of research has been done on the overlap between anxiety and depression, but insomnia is often forgotten. This is the first time that we have investigated all three disorders at the same time, on such a big scale. The comorbidity is extremely high: people may experience these disorders in different stages of their lives, or experience them all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of discussion about the underlying mechanisms. The treatment of insomnia, for example, sometimes also improves &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;—but why? By further investigating this question, we hope to find new leads for follow-up research, as well as better treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times — often on purpose. Now, scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to protect himself from snake bites — and out of what he calls “simple curiosity” — he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At first, it was very scary," Friede said. “But the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no doctor or emergency medical technician — or anyone, really — would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom, the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I’m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, “Oh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very early research — the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the promise, there is much work to do,” said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: “Don't do it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Biological age, measured through biomarkers like lung function and cholesterol, reflects how the body’s systems are aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that individuals with higher biological age also showed brain changes, such as reduced gray matter, which are linked to dementia. Although the study does not prove causation, it suggests that slowing biological aging through lifestyle changes could reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced biological age is linked to a significantly increased dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Changes Observed:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher biological age was associated with dementia-related gray matter loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Biological age can be influenced by diet, exercise, and healthy living habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People whose biological age is higher than their chronological age may be more likely to develop dementia than people whose biological age matches or is lower than their chronological age, according to a study published on April 30, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is based on biomarkers of aging such as lung function, blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not prove that advanced biological age causes dementia; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109422"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of two people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also found that people with advanced biological age also had changes in their brain that are associated with dementia, such as loss of gray matter volume. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential,” said study author Yacong Bo, PhD, of Zhengzhou University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 280,918 participants in a United Kingdom database who were an average chronological age of 57 at the start of the study and did not have dementia at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were followed for an average of 14 years. During that time, 4,770 people developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two methods to measure biological age. In addition to lung function, blood pressure and cholesterol, the methods measured other biomarkers in the blood, such as average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods show how different parts of the body, like metabolism, immunity, liver, kidneys, heart and other systems, work together as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found that those with the most advanced biological age were about 30% more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as age, education level and smoking status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that people with advanced biological age also had changes in their brain that are associated with dementia, such as loss of gray matter volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia,” Bo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that participants in the database tend to be more health conscious than the general population, so they may be less likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by Henan Province and Zhengzhou city governments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1062647563637d717e5071717e3e737f7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 15:31:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1YTUYzcDlxM19vRzZMc25Mdl9EdkZJSGxtRGcxSmxMQmE5TjJkZ01SSmtBTmxkNTVvdjhpVW5ZUzdaTGRoMUtWUWhDbTRwNWt0aS0yUmRMSjMtdzQtNktlRnl5T3gwdlQtM0daYXpwcENUdw</guid></item><item><title>运动是帕金森病的完美解药吗？神经病学家解释说，分享要遵循的锻炼常规-印度斯坦时报 | Is exercise the perfect antidote to Parkinson's disease?

Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is transmitted through direct contact with airborne droplets that spread when a person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Matt Richardson, Denton County Public Health Director&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time the disease was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the affected states are: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data suggests that 97 percent of the patients had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14568905/infants-die-whopping-cough-disease-vaccination-louisiana.html"&gt;not been vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against the virus, while one percent had received only one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest number of cases have been reported in Texas and New Mexico, while Kansas and Ohio have also seen a mounting number of reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To date, there have been 884 confirmed measles cases reported by 33 jurisdictions, new CDC data shows.

Bowel cancer cases have doubled in people under 55 over the past 20 years as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a disturbing trend that point towards the deadly cancer's growing threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2515569/#:~:text=The%20fact%20that%20only%205,major%20opportunities%20for%20preventing%20cancer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggest up to 90% of colorectal cancers are due to environmental and lifestyle factors, which makes them highly preventable. Bowel cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers globally, responsible for over 1.9 million new cases and nearly 904,000 deaths in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just bowel cancer, other types of cancers including breast, bowel, lungs, ovaries, and pancreas are also on rise among youth. Recent research published in The Lancet Oncology has brought renewed attention to the alarming surge in colorectal cancer among younger adults, particularly in high-income Western countries, where trends for older adults have stabilised or even decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest that lifestyle factors such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and rising obesity rates could be contributing to this disturbing pattern. With young women in certain countries experiencing faster increases than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bacterial toxin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in Nature has identified colibactin, a DNA-damaging toxin produced by certain strains of E. coli, as a potential culprit behind the surge in early-onset bowel cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, analyzed tumor samples from nearly 1,000 colorectal cancer patients across four continents and found that younger patients (under 40) were 3 to 5 times more likely to carry mutations linked to exposure to colibactin than those aged 70 and above. This suggests that gut microbiota imbalances could be playing a bigger role than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultraprocessed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munching on ultraprocessed foods like packaged snacks, sweetened beverages, and ready-made meals could be fueling the pandemic of colorectal cancer. Researchers at USF Health and Tampa General Hospital Cancer Institute have found that Western diets having ultra-processed foods and unhealthy oils could trigger chronic inflammation that drives tumour growth. Researchers, funded by a $3.1 million NIH grant, have made significant strides in understanding colorectal cancer. Their first study, published in Gut, explores how processed foods may hinder the body's natural healing processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor to the rise in colorectal and other cancers among younger adults could be the growing impact of stress and mental health disorders. Chronic stress and anxiety can trigger inflammation in the body, weaken the immune system, and alter the gut microbiota, all of which may contribute to cancer development. Recent studies have shown a link between mental health struggles and an increased risk of cancer, with stress potentially accelerating tumor growth by suppressing the body’s ability to fight off abnormal cells. According to the National Institutes of Health, chronic stress can suppress cancer-related immune responses by altering various immune cells, thereby potentially promoting cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer also known as colorectal cancer affects the large bowel, which is made up of the colon and rectum. It begins in the lining of the large bowel (colon) or back passage (rectum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One should not ignore changes in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhea or constipation, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. Stomach cramps, gas or pain could also be a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important sign not to miss is the feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness or tiredness, and losing weight without trying are other signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What's causing heart attacks in youngsters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 15:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>《如此之小》评论：生死攸关的细菌--《华尔街日报》 | ‘So Very Small’ Review: Germs of Life and Death -

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three women have spoken openly about using weight loss medications, with the slimming results clearly visible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green adds: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face after he lost a staggering 120lbs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, along with similar drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy, is approved to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d3311cc0-2755-11f0-b076-a9400e4cbdee"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; but is widely used off-label for weight loss - especially among celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures from 2024, which are likely an undercount, suggest one in eight Americans have taken a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the growing concern about 'Ozempic mouth', Dr Green reveals that she has had an increasing number of patients asking about dermal &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fillers/index.html" id="mol-5fcb3700-26a8-11f0-8cff-2fcb153fa254" class=""&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; around the mouth area to help restore lost volume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert says that Ozempic depletes the subcutaneous fat. This is the visible fat layer just under the skin which you can pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By depleting the subcutaneous fat, the skin appears thinner, with more wrinkling and often lipstick lines,' New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Barry Weintraub told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fillers - gel-like substances injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, smooth lines and enhance facial contours - can 'restore volume to the face, smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and plump the skin to create a more youthful-looking appearance,' Dr Green explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just as the number of people taking semaglutide (the active substance in Ozempic) has skyrocketed, the number of women using fillers has increased close to threefold in the US over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, 1.8 million filler procedures were performed, increasing to 5.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fxing Ozempic mouth can be an expensive task, with filler costing between $700 and $2,000 per syringe, depending on the location and provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another treatment Dr Green recommends as a fix is Thermage, which is a non-invasive radiofrequency treatment that uses heat to tighten skin and improve its appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Like many experts, Dr Green has noticed a number of celebrities suffering from Ozempic mouth as the result of taking weight loss drugs, with one of her standout examples being Whoopi Goldberg. Signs of Ozempic mouth include deep lines around the lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebel Wilson dropped more than 70lbs back in 2021 after turning to Ozempic, and she's committed to keeping the weight off. Sagging around the chin area is one sign of Ozempic mouth the experts point to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by stimulating collagen production, which helps to reduce wrinkles, improve skin laxity, and create a more youthful look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Green adds: 'As the body's collagen levels increase, the skin becomes firmer and tighter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it takes four to six months to see results from Thermage, after which the results can last for approximately one and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients on Ozempic should ideally undergo a Thermage procedure early in treatment or before treatment begins to prevent the development of loose, sagging skin on the face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like filler, Thermage can be pricey, with the 30 minute treatment costing between $1,500 and $3,500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To minimize the &lt;span&gt;aging effects on your smile and mouth due to Ozempic, Dr Green recommends 'consulting with your doctor about adjusting your medication dosage to prioritize gradual weight loss rather than rapid weight loss.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Ilana Ramer Bass of Mount Sinai Health System told this website she recommends eating 'small, well-balanced meals with a focus on fiber and protein' to help keep the skin hydrated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She adds: 'Before any skin conditions develop, causing wrinkles or dryness, I would also recommend seeing a dermatologist before turning to cosmetic surgery.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green says: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face.' Fierstein lost 120lbs in total thanks to weight loss medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic mouth is just the latest body part to be warped because of the rapid and drastic weight-loss turbocharged by Ozempic and similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon, previously told DailyMail.com a loss of fat can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fans speculated stars like Sharon Osbourne and Oprah Winfrey -

Using Mendelian randomisation, scientists linked 29 immune-related proteins to seven neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting the brain is not the only organ involved in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 of these proteins are targets of drugs used for other diseases, opening potential avenues for new treatments.

The findings could pave the way for better treatments of some mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with depression or schizophrenia are treated with drugs that work on brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. However, 1 in 3 people with these conditions do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study led by Dr Christina Dardani and Professor Golam Khandaker in Bristol’s MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) used Mendelian randomisation – a computational approach that uses genetic information from large datasets – to examine whether immunological proteins are likely to be involved in 7 neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team looked at the relationship of 735 immune response related proteins measurable in human blood with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response related proteins in these 7 neuropsychiatric conditions. From the identified biomarkers, 20 showed potential as targets of drugs approved for other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers could potentially be used in the future for novel therapeutics in the area of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in the understanding of causal mechanisms for neuropsychiatric conditions. To date causal explanations for depression and schizophrenia have been predicted on monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, but this study suggests that overactivity of the immune system could also contribute to the cause of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golam Khandaker, Professor of Psychiatry and Immunology and MRC Investigator in the Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS), said: “Our study demonstrates that inflammation in the brain &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the body might influence the risk of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings challenge the centuries-old Cartesian dichotomy between the body and the mind, and suggests that we should consider depression and schizophrenia as conditions affecting the &lt;em&gt;whole &lt;/em&gt;person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to examine biomarkers identified through genetic analysis using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes research based on health records, animal studies, and  proof-of-concept clinical trials in humans, to further evaluate causality; understand precise mechanisms from inflammation to symptoms of mental health conditions; and therapeutic potential – does modulating immune pathways improve symptoms of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by a Medical Research Council programme grant for immunopsychiatry to Professor Golam Khandaker.

The identified biomarkers suggest a role of both brain specific and systemic immune response in the aetiology of schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the identified biomarkers, 20 are therapeutically tractable, including &lt;em&gt;ACE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TNFRSF17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SERPING1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;AGER&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CD40&lt;/em&gt;, with drugs currently approved or in advanced clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the largest available selection of plasma immune-response related biomarkers, our study provides insight into possible influential biomarkers for the aetiology of neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genetically prioritised biomarkers now require examination to further evaluate causality, their role in the aetiological mechanisms underlying the conditions, and therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 13:59:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5FSVlNYUFMVC00RXBlLWlvRnJIc1dMQjFpR215c0FUMWtJQjhjdzc2Zk5CX1JuRWtyY0tSYjJjZURXWWxMZFdENUl2VGZxcnI3YjZmNXRtdFhkRFNabUUxV2ppTW83bGlVY0lhWWV1cnE</guid></item></channel></rss>
