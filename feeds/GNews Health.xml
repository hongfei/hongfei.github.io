Supplements can contain vitamins, minerals, botanicals and amino acids on their own or in various combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The consumption of these products is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10421343/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;surging&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s a common misunderstanding that these products are entirely safe, says Dr Pieter Cohen, an internist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. Excessive amounts of nutrients can cause health problems, so it’s critical to know if you’re using the correct dosage of high-quality products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what experts say about navigating the world of supplements, and what happens if you take too much of some common ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="choose-supplements-and-dosage-carefully" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose supplements and dosage carefully&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ideally, the nutrients we need come from the food we eat, says Dr Denise Millstine, director of integrative medicine at the Mayo Clinic Arizona. But that’s not always possible for various reasons, like a lack of access to nutritious foods or the effects of certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="de198331-d196-4414-a927-b0bac06b0c1d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is it true that… you should take vitamin C when you’ve got a cold?","elementId":"de198331-d196-4414-a927-b0bac06b0c1d","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/08/is-it-true-that-you-should-take-vitamin-c-when-youve-got-a-cold"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some people may need a supplement; some people need to be careful that they’re not getting too much of a supplement,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietitian and clinical instructor at Boston University. “It’s all over the place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are so many of these products for sale, and so many variants of what’s on a label, that shopping and selecting even a single supplement can be “dizzying” for consumers, says Millstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For some nutrients, there’s a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/ODS_Frequently_Asked_Questions.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) – an amount to aim for daily, set in the US by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The RDA can vary by sex, age and medical status. There’s also a tolerable upper intake level (UL), which is the maximum safe daily limit. Consuming more than the UL can cause health problems, depending on the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Additionally, in the US, “there’s no vetting of products before they’re sold to ensure that the label is accurate,” says Cohen, whose&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2815523" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; research&lt;/a&gt; suggests contents and quantity labelling are often inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is limited government oversight over vitamins and supplements. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-regulation-dietary-supplements-dr-cara-welch#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;does not approve&lt;/a&gt; supplements or their labelling before they are sold. The only way to know if what’s listed on the label is accurate is if the product has been certified by the &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/articles/supplement-vitamin-certification" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Sanitation Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (NSF) or &lt;a href="https://www.usp.org/verification-services/verified-mark" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States Pharmacopeia&lt;/a&gt; (USP), says Cohen. These are non-profits with “high-quality, third-party certification programs”, he explains. You can use &lt;a href="https://info.nsf.org/certified/dietary/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.quality-supplements.org/verified-products" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; to find verified products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="check-with-your-doctor-before-taking-any-new-supplement" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check with your doctor before taking any new supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because the recommended amount differs from person to person, it’s critical to speak with a healthcare provider before starting something new. You need to know how the product might interact with anything else you’re consuming, like a medication or another supplement, explains Cohen. Adverse health effects could arise, or medications can become less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Supplements can also affect blood tests, leading to inaccurate results, explains Dr Fernando Carnavali, an associate professor of internal medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He says it’s important to continue to discuss any vitamin or supplement use with your physician in case of evolving research about potential interactions, benefits or harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s best to use vitamins and supplements with caution, just as you would with over-the-counter medications like Tylenol, says Millstine. It’s also a good idea to stick to studied doses. She recommends using the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for information on dosing. The US Department of Agriculture also &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has a tool&lt;/a&gt; for calculating the amount of vitamins and minerals you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Conversely, do not take dosing advice from the person selling the product, due to a risk of bias, says Millstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Carnavali suspects that because vitamins and minerals are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/13/natural-remedies-medication-true-self" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;perceived as natural&lt;/a&gt;, people are less likely to share what they are taking with their medical providers. It’s not uncommon for a patient to come in with questions about their health, only to learn that their vitamin and supplement habits were causing symptoms. “We’re not here to judge – we’re here to guide you,” says Carnavali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-happens-if-you-take-too-much" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if you take too much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multivitamins: &lt;/strong&gt;Multivitamin supplements contain at least three vitamins and one mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s no regulation of what nutrients must be included or how much. &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/MVMS-HealthProfessional/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to the National Institutes of Health, some of these supplements contain vitamins and minerals in amounts higher than the established UL. Accordingly, there’s a risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17209210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;excess nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you’re taking a multivitamin with other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17209218/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harm might occur&lt;/a&gt; depends on the excessive nutrient in question. “Multivitamins can be tricky because you need to look at each of the components, and there are just so many of them,” says Millstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are risks associated with certain individuals. For example, the NIH &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/MVMS-HealthProfessional/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that smokers and former smokers might want to avoid multivitamins with large amounts of beta-carotene or vitamin A, which are linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers. For people who are pregnant, more than &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/Scoop%20Winter%202022.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2,800micrograms (mcg)&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A a day can increase the risk of birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who take blood thinners should speak with their doctor before using a multivitamin containing vitamin K, which can decrease the effectiveness of those drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D: &lt;/strong&gt;“Vitamin D can become quite toxic when taken excessively,” says Millstine. High levels are associated with harms like nausea, vomiting and excessive urination. Extremely high levels are linked to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat and death. The NIH notes that high levels are &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“almost always&lt;/a&gt;” caused by excessive supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Individual requirements can differ, Millstine says. According to the NIH, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the RDA&lt;/a&gt; for adults between ages 19 and 70 is around 15mcg, or 600 International Units (IU). The upper limit for the same group is 100mcg, or 4,000 IU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If your healthcare provider recommends you take vitamin D, it’s advisable to start at the standard dose, then recheck your levels in three months, says Millstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fatty &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;acids: &lt;/strong&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are found in certain foods, like fatty fish and chia seeds. Supplements &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/03/an-omega-3-dose-a-day-could-slow-ageing-process-healthspan-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;like fish oil&lt;/a&gt; or fish liver oil &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/omega3-supplements-what-you-need-to-know#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/apr/07/do-fish-oil-supplements-work" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of omega-3 fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-Consumer/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;haven’t established&lt;/a&gt; recommended amounts for these two types, but the FDA recommends limiting the combined total to no more than 5 grams daily from dietary supplements. High doses can increase the risk of bleeding and stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-fish-oil/art-20364810#:~:text=Taking%20high%20doses%20of%20fish,increase%20the%20risk%20of%20stroke." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A low-quality omega-3 product comes with more risks of side effects, ranging from heartburn to nausea, explains Millstine. These supplements can contain other elements, like vitamins A and D, and &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/omega3-supplements-what-you-need-to-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dosage can vary&lt;/a&gt; from product to product, so it’s important to check the label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":29,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For instance, if you’re taking a 1,000mg fish oil capsule with a 300mg omega-3 content, it’s worth checking what else is in the product, says Millstine. Non-EPA/DHA elements can cause issues like gastrointestinal symptoms and increased risk of bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Another omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found in plants. Apart from the food you eat, you can get ALA from flaxseed oil supplements. The recommended amount of ALA for adults is between 1.1 grams to 1.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium: &lt;/strong&gt;The typical recommendation for adults is 1,000mg to 1,200mg of calcium daily, divided into no more than around 500mg at a time, says Millstine. The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-Consumer/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;upper limit&lt;/a&gt; varies depending on your age and medical status. Calcium can negatively interact with other supplements and medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Too much supplemental calcium can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4708574/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cause kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;. While research is &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/calcium-supplements/faq-20058352" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; and more is needed, some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7910980/#sec5-nutrients-13-00368" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest calcium supplements can increase the risk of heart disease, specifically in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/calcium/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;, more than 1,500mg of calcium a day can lead to stomach pain and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C: &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin C is one of the more overused supplements, because so many people use it to avoid sickness, Blake says. While it may slightly shorten the duration of a cold, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it won’t prevent a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Extra vitamin C simply exits the body during urination. But chronic excessive use can lead to gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea, explains Blake. Doses greater than &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002404.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2,000mg&lt;/a&gt; a day can lead to stomach aches, diarrhea and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Millstine advises about 500mg to 1,000mg per day. “The problem with taking too much is it’s just not helping you, so why would you stress your kidneys in that way?” she asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B12: &lt;/strong&gt;The NIH recommends &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2.4mcg&lt;/a&gt; of B12 daily for most adults, though personalized doses can vary. It’s available in different types of supplements, many of which have very high doses of B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While rare, excessive B12 can be associated with symptoms like anxiety, agitation, flushing and headaches, says Millstine. It can interact with medications like gastric acid inhibitors and metformin. Other forms of vitamin B, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/27/what-is-vitamin-b6-toxicity-and-what-are-the-symptoms-of-taking-too-much" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;like vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;, can be more toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium: &lt;/strong&gt;Magnesium supplements come in various forms, including magnesium oxide, citrate and chloride. These have different effects: For example, magnesium citrate is used as a laxative, so those with more sensitive stomachs might want to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Generally, the RDA for adults is about 300mg to 400mg (depending on age and sex). The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UL for magnesium&lt;/a&gt; via supplements and medications specifically is 350mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there’s &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;no risk&lt;/a&gt; linked to too much magnesium in food, high doses of magnesium might cause nausea, abdominal cramping and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104113241502" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;. Very large doses can &lt;a href="https://medicine.tufts.edu/news-events/news/can-magnesium-supplements-improve-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;be fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with kidney disease can’t excrete excess magnesium and should not take it unless it’s been discussed with their healthcare team, says Millstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-Consumer/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;no official&lt;/a&gt; recommendation for the use of probiotics by generally healthy individuals. Blake recommends speaking with a registered dietitian nutritionist to determine which strain and dosage is right for you. Possible negative side effects include eczema and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you can tolerate probiotics, excessive use may not be toxic, but there could be other downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Probiotics can limit your ability to get to your natural, healthy microbiome,” says Millstine, because high-dose supplements can hinder the diversity of your gut bacteria. “I caution people to really consider if they need probiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine: &lt;/strong&gt;Creatine supplements can cause some bloating and GI symptoms, as well as nausea, says Millstine. She recommends sticking to 4 to 5 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research suggests that higher doses of creatine &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/what-is-creatine-potential-benefits-and-risks-of-this-popular-supplement" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;do not offer&lt;/a&gt; any advantages. Because there’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10999421/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mixed evidence&lt;/a&gt; of a negative effect on kidneys, people with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31859895/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt; are especially advised to speak with their healthcare provider before trying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collagen peptides: &lt;/strong&gt;Collagen peptides are smaller pieces of collagen and can come in powder and pill form. Collagen peptides can possibly help with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1332" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;joint &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844023021680" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;skin health&lt;/a&gt;, though much more research is needed to support these claims, says Carnavali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Though there’s no standardized dose, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31096622/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; shows between 2.5 grams to 15 grams daily is safe. However, research not sponsored by supplement manufacturers is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Millstine’s primary caution is not to use collagen peptides in place of a more complete protein powder, because they lack essential amino acids needed for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNU2toeFNBZk1PN3NmSFU2OGtlSW9feGR2NXZmUUV3UGowY1IydE9jZjQ5QkJQRlJicmtkYjJhTWlieDg0VmdVUXljTlo5LXk5Uk1NaDhGd0tYZW9MbjlCaFg0RnFhck9zbGxFRmZRbGE2UnZZbU9Jd295VjQ4UUlaQzJrUWVLUlBXQTJNcUtESWpZU0hvMzQ2aUt0VQ</guid></item><item><title>许多脱离GLP-1药物的人在2年内体重恢复，评论建议- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/health/weight-loss-drugs-regain-scli-intl-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Many people who stop using &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/glp1-muscle-loss-strength-training-wellness"&gt;weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt; will return to their previous weight within two years, a new review of existing research has found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5f9faw0000356py33edjst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This rate of weight regain is significantly faster than that seen in those who have lost weight by changing other lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, rather than relying on GLP-1 medications, researchers from the University of Oxford report in a paper published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304" target="_blank"&gt;The BMJ journal&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fkzou000c356pocpgenws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone naturally made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fpgkz000i356pt8amw7e4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fpkxg000k356p69fnqkq1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fokxr000f356pgyrh4tl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 medications, which include Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have proven to be highly effective for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fpmuj000n356pro7yu60n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, University of Oxford researchers analyzed the results of 37 studies involving more than 9,300 adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5k1n7w0001356pcmpsngwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that “weight regain after stopping drugs was faster than after ending behavioural weight loss programmes such as diet and exercise support by approximately 0.3 kg (0.7 pounds) per month,” they said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fyky00014356p0gm7dopb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t a failing of the medicines — it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition,” said study lead author Sam West, a postdoctoral researcher at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, in the statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fz9vk0017356p45rpngmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to weight management.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gc8ku001k356p3piyag86@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adam Collins, associate professor of nutrition at the University of Surrey in England, who was not involved in the study, called the paper “timely and important.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gea6m001q356pnn8cjwzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Collins underlined that weight regain is a common issue in all weight loss interventions, but the paper shows that this problem is amplified with GLP-1 medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5jadq8000a356phy0vv64b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Collins also offered some possible explanations as to why this is the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5ge7ma001n356p9zuttxyr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Artificially providing GLP-1 levels several times higher than normal over a long period may cause you to produce less of your own natural GLP-1, and may also make you less sensitive to its effects,” he said in a statement shared with CNN by the Science Media Centre.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5ghh5e001v356pkhpefric@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Collins added that this isn’t a problem when taking these drugs, but taking away this source of GLP-1 then makes overeating “far more likely.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5ghhz5001x356pw8cc62ry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Like any addict, going cold turkey is a real challenge. This is further exacerbated if the individual in question has relied solely on GLP-1 to do the heavy lifting during weight loss,” he said, rather than making behavioral changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5fxsq20011356pq0qkx2xj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Marie Spreckley, obesity researcher and public health nutritionist at the University of Cambridge in England, who was not involved in the study, cautioned that the paper’s long-term conclusions rely on modeled projections, rather than observed data, as the follow-up period for stopping treatment with newer medicines is limited to about 12 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5g8lgu001d356p6sx73bi1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a result, longer-term statements, including full weight regain within two years, rely on extrapolation beyond the available data,” she said in a statement shared with CNN by the Science Media Centre, meaning that comparisons with behavioral changes should “be interpreted as suggestive rather than definitive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5ldt43000h356pidoptxdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In real-world terms, the findings reinforce that obesity management typically requires long-term planning. If people stop medication, many are likely to need ongoing nutritional and behavioural support, and health services should anticipate that cardiometabolic benefits may lessen as weight is regained,” Spreckley said, adding that this highlights “the need for further research into effective, scalable strategies for long-term weight maintenance alongside pharmacotherapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gf8ep001t356p4pqp2x8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 medications have become widely used in recent years, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/glp1-muscle-loss-strength-training-wellness"&gt;more than 15 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are now losing weight with the drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gkizp0023356pbk9lk4wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/health/glp-1-medications-benefits-risks-beyond-weight-loss-diabetes"&gt;a study&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published in January 2025&lt;/a&gt; suggested that popular GLP-1 medications approved for weight loss, diabetes and heart disease may have untapped potential to reduce the risks of substance abuse disorders, psychosis, infections and some kinds of cancer and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5glten0026356pnsrwfkat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, it is important to remember that using&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the drugs to suppress appetite&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;doesn’t just contribute to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fat loss but also to reduced muscle mass.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gpd4l002k356pzrhw1isl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that anywhere between 15% to 60% of the weight people lose is lean muscle mass, meaning that those who are using the drugs are advised to engage in a weekly exercise routine that includes strength training to stave off too much muscle loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5gr8ef002m356pvitgyoe9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is particularly important for those 65 or older, who are already at risk of age-related loss of muscle mass, strength and function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

These protein balls are a favorite for those with a sweet tooth. Each pack contains four protein balls, 12 grams of protein and 11 grams of sugar.

They're more like rice crispy treats, with at least 14 grams of protein and under five grams of sugar per serving in each of the 16 flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-06fccc"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd67395" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-the-only-bean-crunchy-dry-roasted-edamame-beans-(variety-pack)" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Try sea salt, sriracha and buffalo-flavored dry roasted edamame beans in this variety pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="productSpecs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;13 or more&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Grams of fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Flavors:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60ca9a" class="body-graf"&gt;Have you ever tried dry roasted edamame beans? These are so much better for you than chips or other salty junk food, but they have that crunch and flavor to satisfy your cravings.

Some varieties are higher in sodium/salt than others, which may be a concern to viewers with high blood pressure," notes Bauer.

    &lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Dr. Bethany Malone has treated a lot of colorectal cancer patients. The youngest, not counting those with genetic conditions, was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer used to be considered a cancer of older age. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in their teens and early 20s still aren’t the norm, exactly, but are becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have not gone a year in practice without taking a colon cancer out of someone in their 20s,” Malone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone is a colon and rectal surgeon and the associate program director for the general surgery residency at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth. Her experience in North Texas reflects a worldwide trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer — which includes cancer of the colon and of the rectum — is considered early onset when diagnosed in people under the age of 50. While the majority of diagnoses are still among people aged 65 or older, early onset rates have been increasing worldwide, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7994182/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;particularly in high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 report, the American Cancer Society wrote that the trends of decreasing incidence in older people and increasing incidence in younger people are “&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;rapidly shifting the patient population younger&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, “Black Panther” actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer at age 43. More recently, former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders choreographer Criscilla Anderson &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/pop-culture/2025/12/04/former-cowboys-cheerleaders-choreographer-criscilla-anderson-dies-after-cancer-battle/" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;died of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what medical experts say about the rising rates of colorectal cancer in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why are colorectal cancer rates rising among younger people?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts say there isn’t one reason why colorectal cancer rates are rising in the below-50 age groups. But there are some contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s not because of genetics. Dr. Radhika Kainthla, a medical oncologist at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said that about 20% of early onset colorectal cancer patients have a genetic tie-in. That means 80% do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a misconception a lot of times that if it’s a young person being diagnosed with cancer, it must be genetic,” Kainthla said. “But that’s not actually what we’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three experts who spoke with The Dallas Morning News pointed instead to a combination of environmental factors and lifestyle factors, such as diets high in red meat, diets packed with ultra-processed foods and lack of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone at Texas Health Fort Worth said fiber intake especially tends to be low for Americans, which can increase the risk for colorectal cancer. Fiber does a lot of work in the gut, Malone said, including feeding a healthy microbiome and helping to flush carcinogens out of the body before they’re absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone noted that the “lifestyle” factors are not always easily controllable. The U.S. food system has shifted significantly toward ultra-processed foods, which tend to be low in necessary nutrients such as fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also environmental factors at play, said Dr. Emina Huang, a professor of surgery and a colorectal surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center. For instance, living near a superfund site — which are hazardous waste sites — has been shown to increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can I reduce my risk of colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, the three experts said, comes down to a lot of the standard advice that medical professionals recommend for general health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three experts said that folks should focus on getting regular exercise, avoiding smoking, moderating alcohol intake and eating a diet that’s low in red meat but rich in fruits, vegetables and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is also a risk factor for colorectal cancer, the experts said, although Malone cautioned against focusing on weight loss alone. Restrictive diets may also end up being low in fiber, which is harmful rather than helpful for colorectal cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, patients should pay attention to their bodies and seek medical care if they notice abdominal pain or changes in their bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When should I start getting screened for colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger people, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises regular screenings beginning at age 45. The gold standard of screening is a colonoscopy, but stool tests and scans can also be used for screening.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The age 45 recommendation, however, is for patients who have a standard risk for colorectal cancer. Some people may be at higher risk due to personal or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a first-degree relative — a sibling, parent or child — diagnosed with colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps may be advised to begin screenings at a younger age. In general, medical professionals advise beginning screening when a patient is 10 years younger than their relative was at the age of diagnosis. For instance, if your father was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 48, you should begin screenings at age 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with such a family history should start screenings no later than 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, patients who have personal histories of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis are at higher risk of colorectal cancer, too, and should also begin screenings at an earlier age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kainthla, at Parkland, also noted that there are other types of screenings besides colonoscopies, such as blood tests and stool tests, that may be a useful option for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the warning signs of colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts are quick to point out that, for most young people, abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms are unlikely to indicate colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some symptoms should serve as red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common early symptoms are stomach pain that doesn’t go away, changes in bowel movements with no improvement or blood in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, these symptoms can indicate hemorrhoids or other relatively benign conditions. However, if a patient is treated for a benign condition but symptoms do not improve, that’s a sign that something more may be going on.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4am3rr003l26oxdjyigoph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles outbreaks flared up across the US last year, causing a record number of cases, Scott Thorpe kept a wary eye on Spartanburg County, South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00043b6plyzmgp0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in South Carolina’s upstate region, it’s a community with pockets of residents who have particularly low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00053b6pf4u0t11h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not much different than many other parts of the US, especially as vaccination rates have been falling nationwide, said Thorpe, who &lt;em&gt;​&lt;/em&gt;​is the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Public Health Leadership, a nonprofit focused on improving health outcomes across the South. But Spartanburg County had already been through a measles outbreak about a decade earlier, and it’s now significantly more vulnerable: The share of schoolchildren in the county who have gotten the &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and" target="_blank"&gt;required immunizations&lt;/a&gt; has fallen from 95% to 90% over the past five school years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00063b6padzy1xqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it happened: The first measles cases hit the region last fall, and the South Carolina health department declared an outbreak at the start of October. Now, more than 200 cases have been reported over the past few months, and there are no signs of slowing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00073b6ptsomu2li@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As community exposures increase, it’s becoming more and more difficult to actually pinpoint where all cases were exposed,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist with the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4lj7gb000i3b6pgccm8f2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we’re seeing more and more transmission in the community, it’s important to recognize that we will reach a point when we won’t know about all cases,” she said – a worry that has been heightened after the holidays, when schools were closed and public health lost key connection points to the community.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00083b6pxex1pmhg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is lower than the national&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;average in South Carolina, and vaccination rates in Spartanburg County are among the lowest in the state. Local health care providers say that the more imminent threat of measles has changed the calculus for some parents who had been hesitant but now want protection for their child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp00093b6plfgv06dh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others, however, remain staunchly against vaccination — even when measles has reached their doorstep. And while the public health department is enacting measures to contain spread as much as possible, a growing list of exposures is making it increasingly difficult to keep the dam from breaking.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000a3b6phdbkv0x4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The South Carolina measles outbreak probably started in a Ukrainian immigrant community in the Spartanburg area, among whom vaccination rates tend to be particularly low, Thorpe said, but it has taken hold in a much broader population in the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000b3b6p96t7xkus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Antivax attitudes are firmly embedded in Ukrainian society,” says an &lt;a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/vaccine-hesitancy-ukraine-sign-crisis-governance" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2021 by the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank. It cites many possible factors for the sentiment, but much can be traced back to the early 2010s, when the Ukrainian government mishandled the storage and administration of routine vaccinations, resulting in many cases of complications among children that were initially covered up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000c3b6pr9uoi9rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many measles cases in the current South Carolina outbreak have resulted from exposures at local churches. But the outbreak has also continued to grow in the broader community, to the point where some people have had multiple exposure points and it’s unclear which one may have led to a case, Bell said. Public schools have been major sources of spread, and exposures have also been reported at restaurants and shops.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000d3b6pkbxes185@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of measles cases in South Carolina have been among children, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000e3b6px8kfx5h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state health department consistently promotes vaccination as the best defense. It has held pop-up vaccination clinics and continues to offer the mobile health unit to community partners interested in scheduling a vaccination event, but health officials have said that progress has been slow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4lfqj0000b3b6p1pq2e2fw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this time, we need to increase MMR vaccination coverage to stop this outbreak,” Bell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000f3b6ptcp5uouh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When measles cases were growing in New Mexico last year in connection with an outbreak in West Texas, health officials there had much more success. Thorpe said it probably comes down to a difference in resources and deeper investment from the state government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000g3b6p8v517enr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The folks who do outreach at the state health department in South Carolina are doing God’s work. They do amazing things with very little, but they’re still doing amazing things with very little,” he said. “If you want to see turnout and engagement from the community, you can’t wait until there’s something really bad happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000h3b6piohmlqv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With low rates of vaccination among the local population, the health department is relying on other efforts to contain the spread as much as possible. Contact tracing helps the agency notify people who may have been exposed, and unvaccinated people are encouraged to quarantine if they are exposed to a known case. But it’s a time-consuming and resource-intensive process; hundreds of people have been in quarantine over the past few weeks, just a subset of the hundreds more who had to be contacted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000i3b6pztqp5f4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our strategy is primarily focusing on rapidly identifying people who are infectious so that we can contain spread around them,” Bell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4lh7n6000e3b6pbstsyq4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That involves reaching people who had direct, close contact and making public notifications of exposure settings, she said – a prospect that gets harder as the number of exposures increases and more and more people are out and about in the community without knowing that they may be infectious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000j3b6pquu2hpu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For unvaccinated children, quarantine means missing three weeks of school — a consequence that the state health department warns parents and guardians about as they’re &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/form/information-about-childhood-vacc" target="_blank"&gt;applying&lt;/a&gt; for an exemption from vaccinations that are required to attend school. It’s also a talking point that Dr. Stuart Simko, a pediatrician who practices in a town on the edge of Spartanburg County, raises to parents who are hesitant about vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000k3b6ploqzewft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just one more layer that we can talk about,” he said, also noting the significant economic impact it can have on families if a parent has to miss work to take care of a child who is out of school in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000l3b6pa3oiry1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some families have chosen vaccination after going through one round of quarantine, but others have continued to not vaccinate – even after two rounds of quarantine, the state health department said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000m3b6p0b3fxe57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Local pediatricians in the upstate region of South Carolina have also seen parents refuse vaccination for their children, even after direct experience with illness from measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000n3b6pvprgo6id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like many health care providers in the US, Simko had studied measles but had never seen a case. Now his practice has treated five patients, and he says they were some of the sickest he’s ever seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4muvzu00023b6sy5n7eal4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Watching the progression of disease was “shocking,” he said. Through one child’s regular telehealth visits, he watched the rash develop in the hairline and make its way down the child’s body, working with the parents to help manage the high fever and keep the child hydrated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4lzii6000q3b6pdw6qsw6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He looked really sick. You could tell he did not feel well at all,” Simko said. “Definitely one of the sicker kids that I’ve seen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000o3b6p9aupejon@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When parents have specific concerns about vaccinating their children, it’s usually possible to talk with them and find agreement on the importance of vaccination, says Dr. Leigh Bragg, a pediatrician who practices about two counties over from the epicenter of South Carolina’s measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000p3b6p1hnqpfmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But more and more often, parents can’t pinpoint why they’re hesitant, she said — which limits possibility of change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000q3b6pz94uoczz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just kind of a feeling that they have or something that they have seen on social media,” Bragg said. “That has been a challenge as a pediatrician. It’s kind of hard to explain why [vaccines are] important and ease their mind if you don’t really know what their reservations are.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000r3b6pl83ab6rw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine exemptions for nonmedical reasons have become increasingly common in the US in recent years. In South Carolina specifically, religious exemptions have nearly doubled since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000s3b6pv2lg0xwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But not all are for staunchly anti-vaccine reasons or even because of vaccine hesitancy, Thorpe said. In some cases, broader issues around health care access come into play.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000t3b6pj35clvre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look across a lot of the communities with lower vaccination rates, we know a good chunk of those folks who are not up to date on their vaccines are in that situation because they’re struggling with getting access,” Thorpe said. “There’s a lot of great data out there that talks about how important the relationship is between a physician and a family. But if folks are struggling to access those kind of services, that doesn’t really get us so far.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000u3b6paz4uomte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the height of Covid, schools across South Carolina have also been very focused on getting kids back into the classroom to avoid potential scenarios where they fall out of the education system completely, Thorpe said. It puts schools in an “unenviable position” of having to choose between pushing to get the child vaccinated or letting them slide so they can continue to receive education and other services that the school can provide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000v3b6pkb75rx7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many cases, that religious exemption is a lot easier [for parents] than the multiple visits it would take to go see their provider to get their kids vaccinated,” he said. “Until now, the consequences for that were fairly low.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000w3b6piksq70lf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the US ended 2025 with 2,144 confirmed measles cases, according to the CDC — significantly more than at any point since the early 1990s — and 2026 is on track to be just as bad, if not worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4lz0dt000o3b6p907ctyyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In November, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, determined that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Canada had lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; amid a large ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4m1wny000w3b6pnutuu5r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Elimination status in the US – a standing the country has held since 2000 – is now on the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4m0kd6000t3b6p4snl8ifb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple large outbreaks in the US that started last year may be connected, particularly the West Texas outbreak and the ongoing outbreak in South Carolina. Questions remain about exactly how much evidence PAHO will need to determine whether the two outbreaks are linked, but continued spread through the end of January would mark one year since the start – a time frame that Bell considers all but inevitable, especially with more than 100 people currently in quarantine and little change in local vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4angcp000x3b6pnx2nmmny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four major international airports in the US reported measles cases or potential exposures during peak holiday travel last month, and the New Mexico health department warned of possible measles exposure in Albuquerque from someone visiting from South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ir2n300003b6sgi86c1l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Days into the new year, the nation has already seen three measles cases: two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina — the result of a family visit to Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Younger adults with the flu are next, but Hopkins said he suspects cases among older adults will soon make up a larger share of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu can infect anyone and cause serious complications in healthy people and those at high risk. While hand-washing, mask-wearing and vaccination can help to limit contraction of the flu, it’s a hard virus to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the first symptoms to look for this winter and what to do if you get sick:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever and headache are among the first signs of flu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, all ages, the classic symptoms are going to be a pretty abrupt onset of fever, headaches, body aches are really common,” said Dr. Madison Szar, a pediatrician with &lt;a href="https://www.bluebirdkids.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bluebird Kids Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695e6cb5e4b05bed6f971f03" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bluebirdkids.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Bluebird Kids Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chills are common. Respiratory symptoms, such as cough, runny nose and sore throat may also present early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nausea and vomiting can be common in kids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu shows up a little differently in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often in kids, especially our younger kids, we can typically see more gastrointestinal complaints,” Szar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes stomach pain, nausea, vomiting or simply not wanting to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: ingwervanille via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;ingwervanille via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The flu tends to come on faster and stronger than a common cold.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu tends to come on faster than a cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re coming down with a cold, it’s common to have a scratchy throat for a few days before the full sickness hits. This isn’t the case with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flu tends to hit very hard and very fast,” Hopkins said. “People will often be able to tell you within the minute or the hour when their symptoms started.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do flu symptoms come on more swiftly, but they’re generally more severe than cold symptoms, according to Szar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many flu symptoms overlap with the signs of other respiratory viruses, you can’t tell which virus you have unless you take a flu or COVID test. But “generally, if it hits, you feel lousy all of a sudden, you can almost call it to the minute, then that, I can say, is pretty predictably influenza,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you notice flu symptoms, let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to contact your doctor when you notice early flu symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some anti-virals that we can give, but often will work the best within the first 48 hours of symptom onset,” Szar explained. This is especially important for high-risk patients like those with asthma or COPD, Szar added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain symptoms also require medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have initial fever, and then fever gets better and it is controlled without medicine, and your fever comes back, that’s a warning sign, from my perspective, that you really need to make sure you see a health care professional at that point, because flu can also set you up for secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia,” said Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu can also cause dehydration. If you’re feeling lightheaded, dizzy or not urinating frequently, you should talk to your doctor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the millions of people who get the flu this winter, stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to share what you have with others in your family or in your community,” Hopkins said. “The flu is severe for many people.

   &lt;p&gt;Women's health is having a moment. From social media feeds and most-shared podcasts to movies, TV and news headlines, conversations about breast cancer, menopause, hormone therapy and more are officially mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet while it's a welcome and long overdue cultural shift to see these once-taboo topics finally getting airtime, many clinicians say it comes with a catch: The information can be oversimplified at best and often outright wrong, which means doctors spend a lot of time undoing misinformation — or at least adding context so that their patients have the full story.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, during a time of year when many people are focused on improving their health, here are five women's health myths to be aware of. Here's what leading experts said about them, plus the truth they want more women to understand.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was adapted from&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/734289/the-new-rules-of-womens-health-by-meghan-rabbitt-foreword-by-maria-shriver/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;THE NEW RULES OF WOMEN'S HEALTH: Your Guide to Thriving at Every Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 1: All you need to prevent breast cancer is an annual mammogram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mammograms are critical, but prevention starts with understanding your lifetime risk — and whether you need more tailored screening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While mammograms play an essential role in helping to detect breast cancer, they're not enough for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To prevent breast cancer, identifying women at high risk is the critical first step," says Dr. Lisa Larkin, an internal medicine physician specializing in women's health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most people aren't talking with their health care providers about their individual breast cancer risk. The result? Many women at high risk are unaware of the fact that they should be getting screenings beyond mammograms, such as a breast MRI or ultrasound, and possibly more frequently than once a year, says Larkin. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, the American Cancer Society and other organizations recommend women with a high lifetime risk of breast cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/risk" target="_blank"&gt;greater than 20%&lt;/a&gt;) have both an annual mammogram and breast MRI, scheduled six months apart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you haven't talked to your doctor about your lifetime risk of breast cancer, make it a priority. Larkin recommends using one of the free, evidence-based risk-assessment tools available online, such as the &lt;a href="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" target="_blank"&gt;Tyrer-Cuzick Model&lt;/a&gt; or the&lt;a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/" target="_blank"&gt; Gail Model&lt;/a&gt;. Both questionnaires assess likelihood of developing breast cancer within your lifetime by considering factors such as your age, family and reproductive history, genetic factors (such as known genetic variants), breast density and more. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, bring your results to your next well-woman visit to start the conversation about what your score means and how it should inform your breast cancer screening plan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that while you can't change some risk factors that contribute to your lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, healthy lifestyle moves like limiting (or even better, eliminating) alcohol and exercising regularly &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/about-you/concerned-about-risk" target="_blank"&gt;can lower your risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 2: Strength training trumps cardio, especially in midlife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reality: Aerobic exercise is still crucial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These days, women are flooded with information about the importance of putting down those little pink dumbbells and picking up heavier weights. This is a great thing — especially as women navigate hormonal changes in their 40s and 50s. Estrogen plays a key role in helping your muscles grow in response to stressors like lifting weights. This means that with less estrogen coursing through your body, you start to need greater stresses (read: heavier weights) to get the same muscle-building results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, in all the talk about the importance of strength training, it can be tempting to think that you can skip daily walks or time logged on the elliptical machine if you're already lifting weights. Not true, says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist. Exercise that gets your heart rate up increases the capacity of your heart's ventricles to fill with blood, she explains. The more easily they dilate, the more pliable they stay and the less likely you are to suffer from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity exercise — like walking at a pace where you can still have a conversation — can be a good choice because you can do it regularly without needing a lot of recovery. The American Heart Association&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank"&gt; recommends&lt;/a&gt; all adults aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of higher intensity activity (think, hiking uphill or running) each week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 3: Menopause involves years of misery with no upsides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reality: Yes, this big hormonal shift can feel tumultuous. But it can spur positive changes that set you up for a healthier, happier future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no denying menopause is a time of change — not all of it for the better. Thankfully, women dealing with many of the uncomfortable symptoms of this major hormonal transition are now being prescribed menopause hormone therapy or MHT (also referred to as hormone replacement therapy or HRT). After years of misunderstanding and misconceptions, the evidence shows it's safe for the majority of women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, there's still a pervasive sense that menopause is all doom and gloom, when for many women it's an opportunity to reset their health and lives, says Dr. Heather Bartos, a menopause specialist and author of &lt;em&gt;Quickies: One Hundred Little Lessons for Living Sexily Ever After in Midlife&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In traditional Chinese medicine, menopause is known as the 'second spring,'" says Bartos, adding that it's important to consider the many ways this time in our lives is liberating. No more periods or worrying about birth control. No more PMS, cramps or surprise cycles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some women may experience symptoms for many years beyond their last period. Black women in particular tend to have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5266650/" target="_blank"&gt;longer duration of the menopause transition&lt;/a&gt;. But for many women, symptoms do subside in time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The hormonal hell so many women go through during perimenopause is like being in a raft riding down white-water rapids," says Bartos. "But after menopause, you've made your way down the canyon and you get to the lake, where it's placid and beautiful. This makes it a great time to reassess and recalibrate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Are you as healthy as you'd like to be? Are you on target when it comes to your personal goals? Menopause is a time to actually pause — to take stock and make sure you're where you want to be. "It really can be a freeing, beautiful time, especially if you go into it thinking it can be," says Bartos.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Women can maximize workouts based on their menstrual cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reality: There's no good data showing significant changes in strength, endurance, or recovery across the phases of the menstrual cycle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Cycle syncing" is the idea of matching different workout styles or approaches to what phase of the menstrual cycle you're in. For example, proponents may recommend gentle movement (like walking or low-intensity strength training) during the menstrual phase, when estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest and higher-intensity workouts (like heavier strength training and sprint intervals) during the follicular phase, when estrogen rises. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thought is that hormonal fluctuations throughout your cycle can influence strength, endurance and recovery, and that by syncing your training plan with these changes, you can optimize performance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the data doesn't back this up, says Dr. Megan Roche, a sports medicine physician, adding that there are hundreds of different variables that feed into optimizing training. Did your kids wake you up in the middle of the night? Are you stressed about a big work deadline? These factors impact your training, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're trying to tweak how you work out based on just one variable — your menstrual cycle — you risk missing the bigger picture of other things that have impact, too," says Roche.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The upshot: The body knows movement, not perfection, says Roche. If tracking cycle syncing helps you be intentional about your exercise regimen, that's great. But if it makes you overthink your workouts as you try to match the exact right training style to the phase of your cycle, it could be holding you back, she adds. Instead, focus on getting the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended 150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity physical activity each week, and prioritize exercise you look forward to — whether it's a walk with a friend, a pickleball match or lifting weights at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: Heart disease is a bigger health threat for men, and something not to worry about until later in life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reality: Heart disease kills more women than all forms of cancer combined, and our awareness of this fact is declining.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of us are prone to think of heart disease as something that's more likely to happen to men. Or we assume it's a risk for older women, or women who aren't active or who don't regularly go to the doctor. That is, we find ways to distance ourselves from the very real fact that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; women should be concerned about heart health. One &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000907" target="_blank"&gt;decade-long study&lt;/a&gt; by the American Heart Association found that fewer than half of women recognize that heart disease is their leading killer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's another fact that surprises too many women: Your reproductive health history can give your cardiologist a better picture of your risk of heart disease, says Dr. Jayne Morgan, a cardiologist. For example, women who have a menstrual cycle that's shorter than 22 days or longer than 34 days may have an increased risk of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, also put you at greater risk for cardiovascular conditions later on — no matter how long ago you were pregnant or how healthy you are now. If you went through menopause early (before age 40) either naturally or if your ovaries were removed surgically, your risk for a number of heart issues may be elevated. And women who have more frequent hot flashes and night sweats have an increased risk for heart attacks, stroke and other cardiovascular disease as they get older, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If your doctor doesn't ask about these topics when they start asking you about your heart health, be proactive and bring them up yourself, adds Morgan. And if you're not already, follow the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association's guidance &lt;/a&gt;for heart disease prevention, including eating a diet filled with plenty of fruits and veggies and fiber-rich whole grains, staying physically active and keeping stress in check.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-additives-harm-wellness"&gt;Common preservatives&lt;/a&gt; used to keep food safe and extend shelf life may be linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/health/ultraprocessed-food-disease-wellness"&gt;several cancers&lt;/a&gt; and type 2 diabetes, according to two new studies from France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katz, who was not involved in the study, is a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/"&gt;True Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer and preservatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer study, published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BMJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-and-gras-ingredients-information-consumers/understanding-how-fda-regulates-food-additives-and-gras-ingredients#:~:text=the%20FDA's%20review.-,Ingredients%20that%20are%20Generally%20Recognized%20as%20Safe%20(GRAS),the%20FDA's%20GRAS%20Notification%20Program."&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat"&gt;carcinogen,&lt;/a&gt; with a direct link to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.r2613"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; published with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 2 diabetes and preservatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67360-w"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;™ &amp;amp; © 2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, everyone! I missed you all. I spent a good bit of my holiday building the Lego version of the U.S.S. Enterprise: 3,600 pieces. I hope you found time to do something equally cool. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Housekeeping note: I am flying out to San Francisco tomorrow for “&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/07/jp-morgan-healthcare-conference-pharma-industry-outlook-rosy/"&gt;JPM Week&lt;/a&gt;.” On Sunday, I’ll be sending an extra newsletter with my pre-conference thoughts.

That can lead to tissue damage and ultimately chronic diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Scientists are working to establish better baselines because inflammation is so individualized. One day, we may actually be able to measure our systemic inflammation like we do blood sugar or blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chronic inflammation is indeed on the rise, a phenomenon that researchers have &lt;a href="https://news.ucsb.edu/2025/021942/aging-chronic-inflammation-associated-industrialized-lifestyles"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to industrialization and modern life. But inflammation isn’t all bad — it’s actually one of the most important things your body can do to fight infections and repair tissue. It is a flashing signal from your immune system. We just aren’t very good at reading it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That uncertainty has created a vacuum, filled by oversimplified advice and dubious cures. In reality, managing inflammation requires far more nuance than a single supplement or a “clean” diet hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And today, scientists are starting to figure out that nuance. At major academic medical centers like &lt;a href="https://iti.stanford.edu/himc.html"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/human-immune-monitoring-center"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, new clinics are measuring inflammation in patients over time, trying to define what “normal” actually looks like — and when it becomes dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, when we go in for a health check-up, we might ask our doctor, &lt;em&gt;How is my blood sugar? What’s my blood pressure?&lt;/em&gt; But none of us asks, &lt;em&gt;How is my immune system doing?&lt;/em&gt; “Even if we did, they would look at us perplexingly,” said Bali Pulendran, an immunologist at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, Puledran continued, “I think the time will come, not so far in the future…when inflammation will become sort of a vital sign like a blood pressure or glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That future isn’t here yet. And until it is, anyone promising a quick fix for inflammation — especially on TikTok — deserves your skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s what the real experts want you to know about the state of inflammation science right now — and where it’s going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="its-true-our-bodies-are-freaking-out" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;It’s true, our bodies are freaking out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even though inflammation is a process our bodies have always performed, our current fixation on “chronic” inflammation is new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For most of our history, physicians focused on what they could see, like the red, puffy skin around an infected wound, the visible side effects of a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the world has changed. Now we can see the invisible processes of our bodies at the molecular level. Thanks to advances in genomics, cell sequencing and imaging, we’ve learned that inflammation is present within every tissue and every cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Every cell in your body can experience inflammation. That means every cell can remember it,” Naik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For most of human history, inflammation has provided vital protection. In the time before modern medicine offered treatments like antibiotics, prescription drugs, medical devices and life-saving surgeries, the only defense your body really had against outside invaders was its own innate ability to counteract them. Inflammation was the engine for your immune system to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But now that we do have these things, our bodies exist in a state of evolutionary confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A baseline level of high inflammation may have made sense when life was short and pathogens were everywhere. But today, people live longer than ever &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;have access to modern medicine. (There is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-018-0059-4"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt;, too, that inflammation increases with age; scientists call this “inflammaging.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Inflammation is always induced when there is a problem. Sometimes there is nothing to protect from — but it’s induced anyway, and then it makes matters worse,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told me. “For thousands of years, the immune system evolved to deal with infections. Suddenly, the world changed, but the immune system did not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time that our inflammatory drive is working overtime, the environment around us has changed dramatically. Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02085-w"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that more industrialized countries tend to have higher rates of chronic inflammation than less developed countries — cultures that are more steeped in environmental pollution and artificial substances that didn’t even exist a hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And nothing has changed more in these societies, scientists &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/inflammation-what-is-it-and-how-can-my-diet-and-behavior-affect-it/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, than what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Modern grocery shelves are stocked with fatty, ultra-processed foods that may contribute to chronic inflammation.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Foods that interfere with your metabolism can increase inflammation — especially foods high in unhealthy fats and sugar. These are the same types of foods that have contributed to modern health problems like obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure, all of which are linked to higher levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ultra-processed foods are also &lt;a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/ultra-processed-foods-inflammation"&gt;associated with higher rates of chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;: At its most basic level, inflammation starts when the body detects unusual presences. Processed foods are chock full of ingredients that our bodies would have considered strange just a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So that inflammation is happening more isn’t that surprising. This is our body &lt;em&gt;reacting&lt;/em&gt; to new stimuli. But when should we reduce it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxlqKtzOrE"&gt;at least three different kinds of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; — and most of them are actually good. The first, acute inflammation, occurs when you have an illness or an infection and is an important protective layer that your body provides itself. That is not the kind of inflammation that we want to reduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And then there is homeostatic inflammation, which keeps your immune system at the ready and allows your tissues and organs to repair themselves — the same process that allows your muscles to rebuild stronger after lifting weights. It’s necessary for your body, and it definitely isn’t the kind of inflammation we want to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The kind of inflammation that scientists are concerned about is chronic low-grade inflammation above those levels that are necessary for a healthy functioning body. This is the kind of inflammation that can be brought on by a poor diet or by environmental pollution or by an infection that lingers for a long time. (Researchers think that long Covid, for example, may &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1385858/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;be associated&lt;/a&gt; with persistent inflammation even after the acute infection has subsided.) Over just the past decade, investigators have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419307329"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; how this low-grade chronic inflammation can cause damage to people’s tissue and organs at the cellular level over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists are still figuring out when this kind of inflammation is the cause of a disease and when it is simply a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Obviously, when inflammation is a response to an injury, virus or bacteria, it is a symptom. But chronic metabolic diseases and even cognitive problems associated with aging may be the result of persistent and unresolved inflammation: Atherosclerosis, the hardening of arteries that is associated with high blood pressure and heart disease, for example, is one common condition that &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hc0902.104353"&gt;seems to be caused by long-term inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers are also investigating whether dementia and Alzheimer’s disease &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8775769/#:~:text=Abstract,between%20neuroinflammatory%20processes%20and%20dementia."&gt;may be the outcome of an overly inflamed brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;From person to person, we still don’t have the full picture. It’s not possible to say that you or I at any given time have &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; inflammation. Your individual baseline for a healthy amount of inflammation, and when that crosses over into something unhealthy, is the next frontier of inflammation science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="no-magic-bullet-for-reducing-inflammation-yet" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;No magic bullet for reducing inflammation — yet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what would it take to get there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, researchers would need to figure out how to establish personal baselines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We have only recently identified biomarkers — such as cytokines, the immune-signaling proteins, and metabolites produced by the gut microbiome — that can tell us how much inflammation an individual person actually may have. But as with a lot of things in medicine these days, our ability to measure something does not mean that we necessarily know how to interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So you might be able to find a doctor willing to order &lt;a href="https://www.i-screen.com.au/tests/cytokine-inflammation-test"&gt;a test that measures your own cytokines&lt;/a&gt;. But whether the results are really a cause for concern or simply what’s normal for you is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Biomarkers are always a proxy. Sometimes they’re a good proxy, sometimes they’re very generic,” Medzhitov told me. “It’s a very gray area still. We know the answers at the extremes — but not in the middle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“There is no magic bullet.

From the patient’s perspective, you would be committing to a series of blood draws and possibly providing other types of samples (your saliva and stool) over an extended period of time. The samples would then be measured by new technology that can detect inflammation biomarkers. By collecting data over an extended period of time, scientists can see how your inflammation changes after an infection or after you receive a medical treatment or a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That could allow you to play a small part in figuring out what normal inflammation actually looks like and what is actually a cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We are inching toward a future in which we can measure and track inflammation in every patient in the same way we measure and track blood pressure and blood sugar at every primary care appointment. It could serve as an early warning system for certain kinds of health conditions that are not always obvious or measurable through other means; Medzhitov told me that we might be able to get to a point where it becomes a diagnostic tool: Once an inflammation metric has reached a certain threshold, it’s a clear sign that the patient has a specific health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I can envision a future where inflammation is a pre-symptomatic warning sign — something you notice before you feel sick,” Naik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Some day soon, patients could get their inflammation checked when they see a primary care doctor — but not yet.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That is what inflammation care could soon look like — but not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists are investigating the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 drugs; their ability to reduce inflammation &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-glp-1-drugs-reduce-inflammation?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;may explain&lt;/a&gt; why they are associated with a wide range of health benefits, such as reducing the risk of dementia and heart disease and more. But proving that effect and establishing the actual biological mechanism that makes it happen is the subject of ongoing research. Is it the result of lifestyle changes and better diet? Or is it the result of how GLP-1 medications affect the brain, which does help to manage inflammation throughout the body? A combination of lifestyle and biological effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The future of inflammation care is still in the lab — not on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mvrychen/video/7527105664552832286"&gt;TikTok, where influencers are promoting sea moss&lt;/a&gt; as a treatment for inflammation, promising it’ll help to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gracekellyann/video/7553767709931097358"&gt;clear up your skin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morganchompz/video/7529685764393798925?lang=en"&gt;improve your digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“A lot of the remedies that are touted, whether they’re natural or not, have not been tested. Just because someone makes an awesome video…does not mean there is evidence behind it,” said Naik. “There is no magic bullet.

They also recommend getting regular exercise, which has been &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;The obsession with inflammation is symptomatic of so much of our health and wellness discourse these days: It is a reasonable area of concern, but the messages about what’s good and what’s bad have become too simplistic — fertile ground for grifters trying to sell you on a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNNjJKaVlDN3FpNEl2VHUzUFFyMGFlTU5XS1dLRG8tVFV0c2J0ZVBpUDdmeEpUZU03RU5hTDNCUHZDR1plbHZnOG5CbFJUUUp3YWx2dGtaSndyVXh5SU51amp5U1FrRk5JYTdJTGVqMDhsQktURG1pWGFyeFJqRlpWLUpNZkxQOHM</guid></item><item><title>Mpox会再次走向全球吗？研究表明，它正在以奇怪的方式进化-大自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04154-6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04154-6/d41586-025-04154-6_51909580.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04154-6/d41586-025-04154-6_51909580.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured transmission electron micrograph of mpox virus particles (round) within an infected cultured cell (green)." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04154-6/d41586-025-04154-6_51909580.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Mpox virus particles (purple) seem to be spreading more easily between people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: NIAID/SPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mpox continues to spark localized outbreaks in Africa and, on occasion, in other parts of the world, researchers are racing to understand how the virus managed to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01421-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01421-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;spread globally in 2022&lt;/a&gt; — and how it might do so again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in December found that the strain that caused the 2022 outbreak persisted in the testes of mice for weeks after infection and caused tissue damage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting the possibility that the virus could impact male fertility. This has not yet been studied in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv and has not yet been peer reviewed. Meanwhile, the virus continues to evolve. In December, health officials reported a strain of the mpox virus that &lt;a href="https://virological.org/t/inter-clade-recombinant-mpox-virus-detected-in-england-in-a-traveller-recently-returned-from-asia/1015" data-track="click" data-label="https://virological.org/t/inter-clade-recombinant-mpox-virus-detected-in-england-in-a-traveller-recently-returned-from-asia/1015" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;combines genetic elements of two existing types, or clades&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time. Although it is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03531-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03531-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;normal for viruses such as mpox to evolve&lt;/a&gt;, the more opportunities they are given to spread, the more likely they are to eventually evade protection from vaccines and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these data show that scientists “still have a lot to learn” about existing strains, let alone new strains, says Boghuma Titanji, an infectious-disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Mpox belongs to the poxvirus family, which also includes smallpox, “so we should not underestimate what it can do if it’s allowed to become firmly entrenched in human populations and continue to adapt”, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mpox is evolving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mpox infections can cause painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, fever and, in severe cases, death. There are four known clades of the mpox virus: clades Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb (see ‘Quick guide to the clades of mpox virus’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has been infecting humans since the 1970s. Historically, it rarely spread widely, but this all changed in the late-2010s, when a clade II strain caused a large outbreak in Nigeria. A similar clade IIb strain sparked the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01686-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01686-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;2022 global outbreak,&lt;/a&gt; in which more than 100,000 people were infected. It is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed box"&gt;&lt;h3 class="box__title u-sans-serif"&gt;Quick guide to the clades of mpox virus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="box__content u-clearfix"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade Ia: this clade has been spreading in Central Africa since the virus was first discovered to infect humans in 1970. Most infections have been in children, and, until the past few years, transmission occurred mainly from animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade Ib: this clade has caused a surge of cases in Central Africa since its discovery in late 2023. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade IIa: the least-studied mpox clade. It has spread mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire. Modes of transmission are not fully understood; there is no documented evidence of sexual transmission, but it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade IIb: the clade responsible for the still-simmering 2022 global outbreak. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact. The most-affected population has been men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="box__author u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, there was a large increase in infections with clade I mpox, which historically caused sporadic but deadly outbreaks in rural parts of Central Africa. A new subtype of clade I, called Ib, began spreading between people in dense urban areas in late 2023, possibly through sexual contact. This spread has worried scientists because the sudden emergence of clade Ib mpox mirrors the trajectory of clade II before it went global, Titanji says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02793-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04154-6/d41586-025-04154-6_27660704.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Mpox is spreading rapidly. Here are the questions researchers are racing to answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, researchers have been racing to understand how the new mpox clades, Ib and IIb, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02793-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02793-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;differ from their predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. Data from rodents infected with mpox offer evidence to support a theory that these clades are less lethal but more adept at spreading from one person to another because they cause milder illness&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats infected with clade Ib mpox had higher survival rates than those infected with clade Ia, yet they transmitted just as much infectious virus. And the onset of visible skin lesions was significantly delayed in clade Ib infections, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings help to explain why the virus “might be quite efficient in spreading through sex”, as people could be unknowingly transmitting the virus before they are symptomatic, Titanji says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fertility issues?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group of scientists studied how clade IIb mpox infects mice&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They found high levels of infectious virus in the rodents’ testes for at least three weeks after infection, suggesting that the male reproductive tract might act as a reservoir for the virus, and helping to explain why the virus is so efficiently transmitted through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection caused tissue damage that led to the loss of sperm production, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were expecting to see some inflammation or disorganization, but to see that potentially this infection was affecting male fertility was shocking,” says study co-author Alyson Kelvin, an emerging-virus specialist at the University of Calgary in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;h2&gt;Treatments for flu and when to see a health provider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and nurses at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia are seeing more young kids, including infants and toddlers, come into their emergency room and clinics with fever, breathing issues and dehydration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes children who already struggle with &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/your-child-has-asthma-now-what/"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt; and are experiencing complications due to respiratory infections, said pediatrician Dr. Rita Guevara, who sees patients in outpatient clinics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been seeing younger children with breathing issues to the point where they need to escalate care to the ER,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families can often manage flu infections at home with over-the-counter fever reducers, rest and plenty of hydration, including both water &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Treating-Dehydration-with-Electrolyte-Solution.aspx"&gt;and other liquids&lt;/a&gt; like electrolyte sports drinks.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay if kids don’t want to eat when they’re sick, but they absolutely have to keep up on their fluid intake,” Guevara said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children should be drinking enough to still need regular bathroom breaks and infants and toddlers should still make about two to three wet diapers within a 24-hour window, she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When flu is the suspected culprit, as opposed to another virus or bacteria, Guevara said antiviral medications can be very effective in reducing the severity and longevity of illness when given within 48 hours of symptoms starting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts recommend that parents and children seek professional help if symptoms become severe, including high fevers and &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx"&gt;signs of dehydration&lt;/a&gt;. Kids who appear to get better, but then suddenly get worse again, may be experiencing complications, Guevara said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can start with the flu virus and that can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to getting a bacterial infection on top,” she said. “We do see some children that end up needing antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections when everything started with the flu.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerning &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/signs-respiratory-distress-children"&gt;changes in breathing&lt;/a&gt; is also another red flag and cause for more care, Guevara said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re allowed to cough. We love &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/cough-and-cold-survival-kit-top-symptom-relief-essentials-for-families.aspx?_gl=1*99svnw*_ga*MTgyMDkzMDQ5LjE3Njc3MTU2MTI.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njc3MTU2MTIkbzEkZzEkdDE3Njc3MTU2MTkkajUzJGwwJGgw"&gt;coughing&lt;/a&gt;, because it brings up mucus and it helps clear the passages. You’re not allowed to be struggling to breathe,” she said. “If a child is working hard to breathe, they’re belly breathing, the flaring of their nostrils, they’re sucking in in their neck and between the ribs, that child needs to be seen.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids may also show other signs of a worsening illness, including excessive fatigue and painful body aches that go beyond the level typically seen. Guevara encourages parents to act on their “Spidey senses” when caring for their sick children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know your child as well as you do, so we are partnering with you to tell us, ‘This is not my child, they are not okay,’” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts also recommend preventative measures like frequent hand washing, masking and cleaning of commonly used surfaces, as well as staying home from work, school, day care and other social settings when feeling sick.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So if you’re used to walking 500 steps a day and you add an extra 1,000, that is directly linked to a decrease in mortality, morbidity and improvement in general health,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="f4ec6d3b-47ea-4dd2-b7d5-72d3b19ed052"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="1612d3e1-e1fe-4241-994f-c03f107e2785"&gt;And if you struggle to hit the common target of 10,000 steps a day, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;recent research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that hitting a lower count could be just as beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems the benefits you get are maximized at around 7,000 steps. So if you did 7,000 steps versus 12,000, there’s a marginal, negligible difference to the amount of benefits that you’re going to reap from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-can-we-keep-walking-well-into-older-age" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-can-we-keep-walking-well-into-older-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can we keep walking well into older age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="27914e74-171d-49ce-b611-16e9de5b751a"&gt;Walking is one of the best things you can do to stay healthy as you age—but there are other ways to boost your healthspan, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajan says it's important to work on your balance as you age, by maintaining your muscles and spatial awareness (proprioception).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loss of proprioception with age is not uncommon, and it can lead to an increased risk of falls and falls can be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises strength training to mitigate against muscle loss. This can be as simple as committing to regular bodyweight squats or sitting and standing repeatedly from your couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajan also suggests working on specific proprioception exercises, like closing your eyes and balancing on one leg (with a support if needed), increasing the time as you get more confident.&lt;/p&gt;

Previous experimental studies have shown that certain preservatives can damage cells and DNA, but firm evidence linking preservatives to type 2 diabetes or cancer risk remains scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In both studies, researchers set out to examine the association between exposure to preservatives and the risk of type 2 diabetes and cancer in adults, using diet and health data from 2009 to 2023. The findings were based on more than 100,000 French people enrolled in the NutriNet-Santé study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the effect of preservatives overall, 17 preservatives were analysed individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the cancer study &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, of the 17 individually studied preservatives, 11 were not associated with cancer incidence, and no link was found between preservatives overall and cancer. However, higher consumers of several preservatives were associated with higher risk of cancers compared with non-consumers or lower consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, potassium sorbate was associated with a 14% increased risk of overall cancer and a 26% increased risk of breast cancer, while sulfites were associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sodium nitrite was associated with a 32% increased risk of prostate cancer, while potassium nitrate was associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (13%) and breast cancer (22%). Total acetates were associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (15%) and breast cancer (25%), while acetic acid was associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While more studies are needed to better understand these potential risks, the researchers noted that several of these compounds could alter immune and inflammatory pathways, possibly triggering the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This was an observational study, so no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers could also not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, this was a large study based on detailed dietary records linked to food databases over 14 years and the results were consistent with existing experimental data suggesting adverse cancer-related effects of several of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This study brings new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, they called on manufacturers to limit the use of unnecessary preservatives, and backed recommendations for consumers to eat fresh and minimally processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof William Gallagher, of University College Dublin, who was not involved with the study, said the findings had public health implications. “These higher rates of cancer are modest but are significant when taken at a population-based level in terms of potential impact,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the type 2 diabetes study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67360-w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, higher intake of preservatives overall, of non-antioxidant preservatives and of antioxidant additives was associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, by 47%, 49% and 40% respectively, compared with the lowest levels of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of the 17 preservatives studied individually, higher consumption of 12 of them was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is the first study in the world on the links between preservative additives and the incidence of type 2 diabetes,” said Mathilde Touvier, a coordinator of the study. “Although the results need to be confirmed, they are consistent with experimental data suggesting the harmful effects of several of these compounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPSlRweUQwdmplc0F6b25zVllXUHI4ZEpnM0ExUjN1S2NWLTIxR3hiYWpzTW9BY2xTLUNYMkJPc1ozV1Npa01oRzJIMVJRYjBVeVFPV2IyV3RtMGJuOGs3c3lfc0g5bG55TVQyU1c0NEJHOUYwRGNrTEV5dVZCNGl6bGZpcC04UEtYS1M0dmNLR0pWVVRtaHNsdmtWdjlvYlJUaF93Ynl0R2ZXaVVabmdHbVZKZkdFMGJyZ1A0</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州流感病例激增；卫生官员说，一些孩子使用呼吸机-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2026/01/07/michigan-flu-cases-surge-some-kids-on-ventilators-health-officials-say/88075125007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_dt"&gt;Jan. 7, 2026, 11:02 p.m. ET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan physicians and state health officials said influenza and other vaccine-preventable diseases are surging, especially among the state's youngest residents, some who have needed ventilators to help them breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We're hearing from (pediatric hospitals and other facilities that treat children) those influenza cases are increasing exponentially," said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, Wednesday during a virtual media roundtable with other experts.

We are seeing their impact right now,” Bagdasarian said. “Michigan’s standing recommendation reinforces that following evidence-based immunization schedules is one of the most effective ways to protect children at the ages they are most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/michigan-moves-away-from-kennedy-appointed-council-for-vaccine-advicemichigan-moves-away-from-kenned/87827679007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bagdasarian issued a recommendation&lt;/a&gt; advising health care providers to follow vaccine schedules for children from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), shifting away from guidance coming from President Donald Trump's administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her recommendation came after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end the longstanding recommendation that all U.S. babies get the hepatitis B vaccine, according to the Associated Press. Kennedy has long been critical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/news/local/michigan/2025/12/09/expert-bagdasarian-warns-michigan-childhood-vaccination-rates-falling-vaccines-questioned-gop/87687875007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bagdasarian said last month&lt;/a&gt; that the state's rate of children ages 19-35 months receiving all their required vaccinations to enroll in school has dropped to 68.4%, down from 75.4% as of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The state health department has recorded 2,110 influenza-related hospitalizations this flu season, including 306 among children ages 4 and under. The disease is responsible for "at least" eight U.S. pediatric deaths this season, Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to state data, there were more than 1,400 hospital admissions associated with acute respiratory virus for the week ending Dec. 27, the latest week for which data is available. Among those, 929 admissions were for influenza, 378 were for COVID-19 and 128 were for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The flu accounted for 8% of all patient visits to emergency departments around the state the week of Christmas, up from 6.7% for the same week in 2024. Children up to age 17 accounted for more than 69% of all emergency department visits for acute respiratory virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Flu is not a mild illness for many children,” said Dr. Aarti Raheja, a pediatrician and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Michigan Medicine. “Every year, children become seriously ill from flu complications that could have been prevented with vaccination. Some require intensive care, and most children and adolescents who die from the flu are unvaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most states in the U.S., including Michigan, reported “high” or “very high” levels of influenza-like illness during the week of Christmas. The nation 's outpatient visits recorded for flu-like symptoms were the highest since at least the 1997-98 flu season, according to a Miami Herald report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan is also dealing with its first measles outbreak since 2019 and its worst since 1992, officials said. State data shows there were 30 confirmed cases of the disease during 2025, half of which were associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Officials are also concerned about pertussis, also known as whooping cough. In 2024, the disease exploded, with more than 2,000 cases confirmed, up from just 110 cases in 2023. The total caseload fell to 1,160 during 2025, but Bagdasarian said that figure could be improved with better vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;About 70.1% of Michigan toddlers are vaccinated against pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;mreinhart@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Max_DetroitNews" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;@max_detroitnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxQek03aGgxOHYyYlk2Rld5UDJLTlpsY2xVeWEyQkQ3dmlkNFp5S2xCekowMGFSTHhCOERaczhFdDU3aDhFSHhJMkpFTjJnWm55Q3hPZkp6c2tiTTVGYTdhbHBRT09RS2xzbDBvd0s4a2ZVTGNwLTZiX2E5Q2VGVjhfcklqS19BY2U2ZEluWXJoY2V5ekFLTVlnaU9KTVlHakI0NzJRcEhzZEE5S2RIQ0U0dWo5Tko4U1lNeDJQN19yNUpEandUUmZ0NURONEhmWWc3MHo2MlB3WVJJRG9nLW9PNkxR</guid></item><item><title>一种肠道微生物在高脂肪饮食中阻止小鼠体重增加- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gut-microbe-blocks-weight-gain-in-mice-on-a-high-fat-diet</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Among the diverse community of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes that call the human gut home, scientists have identified a bacterial species that can single-handedly and significantly reduce weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.10.007"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by microbiologists from the University of Utah, the gut bacteria species &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turicibacter"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was singled out for reducing weight gain and improving metabolic health in mice fed a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't think one microbe would have such a dramatic effect – I thought it would be a mix of three or four," &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/12/gut-bacteria-put-brakes-weight-gain-mice"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; June Round, a microbiologist from the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements of the molecules produced by &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; could eventually help to reduce the health effects of obesity in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-molecule-made-by-gut-bacteria-could-cut-type-2-diabetes-risk"&gt;Tiny Molecule Made by Gut Bacteria Could Cut Type 2 Diabetes Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity can lead to various metabolic diseases like type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="187737" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which affects &lt;a href="https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/"&gt;millions of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. The gut microbiome exerts &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-how-some-gut-microbiomes-could-be-promoting-obesity"&gt;profound effects&lt;/a&gt; on metabolic health and obesity – yet it's a two-way street, as this microbiome is continuously &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;shaped by one's diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12506"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gastric-bypass-surgery-gives-patients-a-new-set-of-helpful-microbes"&gt;low microbiome diversity&lt;/a&gt; to obesity. Similarly, that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126931"&gt;diversity declines&lt;/a&gt; in animals that are fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187738" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187738" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-composite.jpg" alt="Researchers Discovered a Gut Microbe That Can Singlehandedly Halt Weight Gain in Mice" class="wp-image-187738 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-composite.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-composite-600x476.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187738" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A collage of microscopic images, not to scale, shows the rod-shaped &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; in the foreground, set against a cross-section of intestine, with a fluorescent microscopy image of other bacteria in the background. (Klag et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt;, one part of a metabolically protective community of microbes that includes at least 80 bacterial species, present in the microbiome milieu at a relative abundance of around 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; produces a suite of fatty acids that keep other, more detrimental fat molecules in check. These detrimental fatty molecules are called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"&gt;ceramides&lt;/a&gt;: they increase as a result of a high-fat diet and are associated with metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it appears that the fatty acids produced by &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter &lt;/i&gt;confer numerous metabolic advantages by affecting how fat is absorbed in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, could &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; allow one to gorge themselves on chocolate cake and remain relatively lean? Alas, no, because &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; populations fluctuate with diet – too much fat in its environment stifles the growth of this beneficial bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187739" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-table.jpg" alt="Researchers Discovered a Gut Microbe That Can Singlehandedly Halt Weight Gain in Mice" class="wp-image-187739 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-table.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/turicbacter-table-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187739" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; supplementation brings about multiple favorable metabolic changes even when mice are fed a high-fat diet. (Klag et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; growth was halted by the presence of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"&gt;palmitate&lt;/a&gt;, a major saturated fat component that's common in high-fat diets. Interestingly, this fat component did not kill the &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; bacteria, which resumed their growth cycle once removed from the palmitate-laced environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; protects against the detriments of high-fat diets but is also depleted by them, &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; levels must be topped off through regular supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when mice were given an oral &lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; supplement five days a week, they displayed less weight gain, lower resting glucose levels, reduced body fat, and other favorable changes in lipid profiles, even while still fed a diet high in fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are medically exciting, but further study is warranted to see if they apply to humans. It's a complex, ever-evolving avenue for future therapies because &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-extra-sense-may-connect-gut-bacteria-with-our-brain"&gt;gut microbe&lt;/a&gt; research remains an '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-than-99-percent-of-the-microbes-inside-us-are-unknown-to-science"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;', of which only a small portion has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work adds to a growing body of research into the connection between metabolic health and the gut microbiome. In one &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05414"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt;, gut microbes from obese mice were transferred into lean mice with no gut microbiome of their own – and those formerly lean mice gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another, perhaps counterintuitive &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0605374104"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, mice that had all their gut bacteria wiped out were protected from gaining as much weight while on a fatty diet, compared to those with normal microbiomes. That suggests that certain microbial mixes are linked to weight gain and increases in body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/i&gt; is likely to be just one of many allies. Developing an arsenal of other beneficial microbes and 'weaponizing' their lipids in the fight against metabolic diseases could open new treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With further investigation of individual microbes, we will be able to make microbes into medicine and find bacteria that are safe to create a consortium of different bugs that people with different diseases might be lacking," &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/12/gut-bacteria-put-brakes-weight-gain-mice"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kendra Klag, microbiologist from the University of Utah, and first author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, unlike the current craze over &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;Ozempic and its kin&lt;/a&gt;, bacterial therapy could be specially customized in accordance with each person's unique needs while squashing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, as these bacteria and lipids are already present in human guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.10.007"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This outbreak was driven by human-to-human transmission of the virus through close contact, often via sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the number of mpox cases has significantly declined since the 2022 outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/mpox-worldwide-overview"&gt;clade II mpox has become established&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several countries in central Africa have also reported an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON587"&gt;increase in clade I mpox cases&lt;/a&gt; since 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since August 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/10/17/california-mpox-strain-cases/86748970007/"&gt;four clade I mpox cases have occurred in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, including in people who did not travel to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how mpox outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad will continue to evolve in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oropouche virus – insect-borne and poised to spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1961.10.574"&gt;first identified in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; on the island of Trinidad off the coast of South America.

The illness usually lasts just a few days, but some patients have weakness that can persist for weeks. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;illness can also recur&lt;/a&gt; after someone has initially recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many unanswered questions about the Oropouche virus and the disease it causes, and there are no specific treatments or vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, infections in people were thought to occur only in the Amazon region. However, beginning in the early 2000s, cases began to show up in a larger area of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-025-00862-2"&gt;South America, Central America, and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Cases in the United States are usually among travelers returning from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, Oropouche outbreaks will likely continue to affect travelers in the Americas. The biting midge that carries Oropouche virus is found throughout North and South America, including the southeastern United States. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;range of the virus&lt;/a&gt; could continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even more viral threats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of other viruses pose a risk in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya"&gt;global outbreaks of the chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt; may affect travelers, some of whom may want to consider getting vaccinated for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-chikungunya-a-guide-to-the-virus-spreading-in-china"&gt;What Is Chikungunya?

not people who just want to get a bit slimmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And doctors should also prescribe lifestyle changes that include eating healthily and getting enough exercise to help people keep the weight off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many say the treatment should be considered life-long, given the risk of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People who have tried coming off the jabs describe it as "a switch that goes on and you're instantly starving". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One woman said: "It was like something opened up in my mind and said: 'Eat everything, go on, you deserve it because you haven't eaten anything for so long.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Adam Collins, an expert in nutrition at the University of Surrey, says the way the jabs work in the brain and body might explain why weight regain is amplified once you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They mimic a natural hormone called GLP-1, which regulates hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Artificially providing GLP-1 levels several times higher than normal over a long period may cause you to produce less of your own natural GLP-1, and may also make you less sensitive to its effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"That's not a problem when taking the drugs, but as soon as you withdraw this GLP-1 'fix', appetite is no longer kept in check and overeating is far more likely."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Going cold turkey is a real challenge, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This is further exacerbated if the individual in question has relied solely on GLP-1 to do the heavy lifting... artificially suppressing their appetite without them establishing any dietary or behavioural changes that would help them in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tracking.ucl.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=0CUGnalR16w9EgLB4OS6kCnsPnDHBMWCuGX5NRTm05GyHZr7O8moCoR1I7KzH2OK8apBLgf-McfyzS1tZl52AsHFHpyAo84EdFb0BPKB4Ov26HoG7ex5KIi-3sHX06J4XkDorjxhusCtdi4OP42IvSeAkMcsVKeOAzxVGcooglpc2e9TXJ7jF5S1s7QNjBhfojrTPNHqGrL9qSKPbZ7q_NI_bg3SVebFjuYJA3hwiDHvdUIWuig_akdlNx_5TQL5RNhR_ygkAEkc2wy7cxpzSaCOb05F_SNQ7YblH4Lec4xZW2sK4r6nxu1U_vG1w9J_HEw_7k1BxOikBxvo-FFXrq0b-D3ETc9hCKgpfASthEGu6woHDazC8ialGsB2jMXUwhd9acjZ0R-J8c478bpLd4fOvFdDLz_zVNVcNvTwnc9wdEklY2mjcF788m1ff-s3P66ha14ulxraS5v7ECTYEC9Pv_CTavsbRYzLtvUfr1e-ifZONB_vEMy2ZKg2_2KGn_EZa5buVQd_-omiLzzGMwu8EQa_vov2h6CC3GulZqzpDKeCSCl4BvLeg2xcy4Y9UupOsSzBRcJkFGzmTAJeWkN-2MwDqHhFF7_iq9g9kREzDMztGLEGFjgLDxHC4zz90PjFTGGVPOfY2Rax7tsr3ZOrHTKa4_Nras_4Alvh5lSallCy9pk9nsB9uLxvLn0EPnzPR44VX-cWkGbm4V4512wp6DPt63BDj4oA3RbI5i4Er_1VPf6qDPiKgvUyIXFDA4QrpCSJ1u1tVQXxQ4KhkWzbqcynwLJGSRzjK93neKwI4zuxJDG-VqfV7lf9-9aBfHoAdgiOyOegOKtSiDCxsV_aGVdOr1N6YTzFhCUlhUQC2xblkedjqdgDFsBa0neyqNBzm1EiSet3c7KLj_nRRYjYqCDGcWfRUuMlsAw04MmPVjSvk7T_7o21WV-B8XZ6uXz-72qUxyzDJ2-s1J4Ca3ebBOxGpdbX0QrLLypkPQkfIwp7RUlSEdYDtaOMl5f2ZXidOpyaWzLmAKvtl-8z7SoII0IHzHLx_lMAExfP0pWzeIx9NNjZ4h7fsL6xRlV3zw3ni1R0PDbC9g6tOK7z4vsV41lkV7wcKGRUFhDV3aMZAq-hRQ-dAZyICI1DHADByhHVCR9YrzIXVb1avi4V42amUSR_NrOhICQQxu7kBygn1wLLbt3Q8219I4MdTZsAAaONzPi-J0iGJr-hmCsCpscjXS2GIWUFHojwjPWFjsPi6CKxk3Ydo2QLoDuWuuJyzM3UAXN1EDAokZYwcVwRF6rTTuYDZL1gqCZIeS2usI8EAoyiZB065zHNsYm6L9wrU_XP61C23oXJYd0lrXxWM-6OR2xl1bTUm0dzf7kftkxQ0" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;latest best estimates&lt;/a&gt;, around 1.6 million UK adults have used these injections in the past year -

			&lt;p&gt;There may be two distinct subtypes of multiple sclerosis, according to a new study led by scientists at University College London (UCL). The finding, if validated, could help doctors provide more specialized care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="187707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; to analyze data drawn from blood tests and brain scans of 634 patients participating in two different  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="187707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Machine learning models are trained to pick up subtle patterns that humans might miss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood tests were for detecting a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/multiple-sclerosis/ms-approaches/neurofilament-light-chain"&gt;known biomarker&lt;/a&gt; of diseases of the nervous system, including multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="187707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans, meanwhile, surveyed damage and other changes in different parts of the brain. In MS, the body's immune system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smoking-gun-study-reveals-how-virus-may-trigger-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;mistakenly attacks&lt;/a&gt; the protective sheath covering nerve cells, leaving lesions that interfere with nerve communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-signals-may-predict-multiple-sclerosis-7-years-before-symptoms"&gt;Blood Signals May Predict Multiple Sclerosis 7 Years Before Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the blood test results and brain scans, the model was able to sort patients into separate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-has-divided-multiple-sclerosis-into-three-new-subtypes-based-on-brain-scans"&gt;subtypes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those classed as "early-sNfL" showed elevated levels of the protein earlier on, as well as damage to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"&gt;corpus callosum&lt;/a&gt;, a structure that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This subtype seemed to be more aggressive, with patients developing brain lesions faster than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second subtype was named "late-sNfL", and it seemed to progress more slowly. For patients in this group, the first signs were shrinkage in the limbic cortex and the grey matter deep inside the brain. Levels of sNfL in their blood serum didn't start to rise until later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By using an AI model combined with a highly available blood marker with MRI, we have been able to show two clear biological patterns of MS for the first time," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/ai-analysis-reveals-two-distinct-types-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arman Eshaghi, a neuroscientist at UCL and co-founder of &lt;span&gt;Queen Square Analytics, a spin-off company involved in the research&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will help clinicians understand where a person sits on the disease pathway and who may need closer monitoring or earlier, targeted treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187718" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187718" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-642x389.jpeg" alt="Two New Subtypes of Multiple Sclerosis Have Just Been Identified, Say Scientists" class="wp-image-187718 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-642x389.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-1115x675.jpeg 1115w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-768x465.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-1536x930.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-2048x1239.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/awaf331f1-600x363.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the study, which used machine learning to analyze select features on MRI scans and blood test results to classify patients into two groups. (Willard et al., &lt;em&gt;Brain,&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine learning model was trained on data from 189 patients with different &lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/neurology/multiple-sclerosis-information/types-of-ms"&gt;types of MS&lt;/a&gt; (relapse-remitting or secondary progressive MS), then tested on a further 445 patients who had been recently diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilaments are proteins that provide support for neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in healthy patients, they have a fairly slow turnover. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/iron-in-the-brain-might-help-explain-curious-link-between-adhd-and-dementia"&gt;neurodegeneration sheds&lt;/a&gt; these proteins into bodily fluids at higher rates, making them a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-biomarker-can-foreshadow-early-alzheimers-years-before-symptoms"&gt;potential biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for nervous system diseases and disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the difference is fairly subtle in blood serum, which makes it hard to use for diagnosis. MRI scans can also resolve patterns in the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30451-4/fulltext"&gt;spread of MS&lt;/a&gt;, but not the specifics of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists behind the new study suggest that combining neurofilament levels with other data, such as MRI scans, makes those measures more useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By adding sNfL, an established indicator of neuroaxonal injury, we have advanced beyond the structural snapshot provided by MRI alone," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf331"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, MS is classified and treated based on symptoms and the progression of the disease, but this doesn't account for the underlying mechanisms. The researchers of the new study say that their combined technique could help doctors recommend &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-has-divided-multiple-sclerosis-into-three-new-subtypes-based-on-brain-scans"&gt;more appropriate treatments&lt;/a&gt; if validated in further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf331"&gt;Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

For Day 4 of the challenge, let’s do a short and fun activity based around a concept called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812665/"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-19s2qxj"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Decades of research show that people who have more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3193875/"&gt;years of education&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209353"&gt;cognitively demanding jobs&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022252"&gt;mentally stimulating hobbies&lt;/a&gt; all tend to have a reduced risk of cognitive impairment as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Experts think this is partly thanks to cognitive reserve: Basically, the more brain power you’ve built up over the years, the more you can stand to lose before you experience impairment. Researchers still don’t agree on how to measure cognitive reserve, but one theory is that better connections between different brain regions corresponds with more cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;To build up these connections, you need to stimulate your brain, said Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health and the founder and chief medical officer of the telehealth platform Isaac Health. To do that, try an activity that is “challenging enough that it requires some effort but not so challenging that you don’t want to do it anymore,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/well/mind/dementia-bilingual-language.html"&gt;Speaking a second language&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to be good for cognition, as has &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.6061"&gt;playing a musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30025547/"&gt;visiting a museum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5473779/"&gt;doing handicrafts&lt;/a&gt; like knitting or quilting. Reading is considered a mentally stimulating hobby, and experts say you’ll get an even bigger benefit if you join a book club to make it social. Listen to a podcast to learn something new, or, better yet, attend a lecture in person at a local college or community center, said Dr. Zaldy Tan, the director of the Memory and Healthy Aging Program at Cedars-Sinai. That adds a social component, plus the extra challenge of having to navigate your way there, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3025284/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8408511/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that playing board games like chess can be good for your brain; the same goes for doing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885259/"&gt;crossword puzzles&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that other types of puzzles, like those you find in brain teaser books or from New York Times Games, can also offer a cognitive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;But there’s a catch: To get the best brain workout, the activity should not only be challenging but also new. If you do “Wordle every day, it’s like well, then you’re very, very good at Wordle, and the Wordle part of your brain has grown to be fantastic,” said Dr. Linda Selwa, a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. “But the rest of your mind might still need work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;So play a game you’re not used to playing, Dr. Selwa said. “The novelty seems to be what’s driving brain remodeling and growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Today, we want you to push yourself out of your cognitive comfort zone.

                &lt;p&gt;A dose of the gym might do wonders for both an ailing body and mind. A report out today finds that exercise can provide similar benefits for depression as other widely used treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK reviewed the medical literature on exercise and depression, examining dozens of clinical trials. They found convincing evidence that exercise can reduce depression symptoms, at least in the short term, as well as evidence that its effects match that of therapy or antidepressants. Though more research is needed to fully quantify these benefits, exercise should be considered part of the toolbox used to help treat depression, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise provides an option for people experiencing depressive symptoms, along with pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies,” lead study author Andrew Clegg, a professor at the University of Lancashire, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;An extensive analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clegg and his team’s &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted on behalf of the Cochrane Library, a British-based research organization known for its comprehensive reviews of clinical trial data related to important public health topics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They examined 73 randomized trials that collectively involved almost 5,000 adults with depression. Fifty-seven trials directly compared exercise to either no treatment or a control; ten trials compared exercise to therapy, and five compared exercise to antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, Clegg’s team determined that exercise is reliably better at reducing depression compared to no treatment, though this reduction is likely modest on average. That said, the long-term benefits of exercise for depression are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also concluded there is “probably little to no difference in depressive symptoms” among people who regularly exercise compared to people taking therapy. The same seems to be true when comparing exercise to antidepressants, but the evidence there is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings also suggest that light or moderate intensity exercise might be more effective for depression than vigorous exercise. And though no single form of exercise seemed to be substantially better than others, a mixed exercise program or resistance training might be better than aerobic exercise alone, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Remaining questions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cochrane review is the latest &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2815858"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that exercise can reduce depression symptoms at least as well as other conventional treatments. But the authors say there are still important aspects that could be understood better with larger, higher-quality randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If additional research were to be funded, it should consider which type of exercise is most effective in the long-term, how much exercise should be undertaken and for how long. Also, to look at who benefits from exercise, as it may benefit some people but not others,” explained Clegg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise is undoubtedly one of the best things you can do for your &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/study-less-10-000-steps-day-death-mortality-health-1850722379"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;, however, and it’s likely to come with few side effects (the review noted that reported “adverse events” from exercise were uncommon). Some research has also suggested that combining exercise with other interventions like therapy can be &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/10/7/116#:~:text=The%20findings%20of%20this%20meta%2Danalysis%20provide%20support%20for%20the%20use%20of%20exercise%20as%20an%20effective%20adjunct%20treatment%20for%20depression%20across%20a%20range%20of%20comorbidities.%20Specifically%2C%20the%20addition%20of%20moderate%20intensity%20exercise%20to%20BT%20may%20yield%20superior%20improvements%20in%20depression%20symptoms"&gt;even more effective&lt;/a&gt; than either alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;People dealing with depression should ultimately be encouraged to pursue the treatments they’re most comfortable with, Clegg says. But that list of options can certainly seem to include exercise.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Don't try to aim for the last week of October, because you're going to forget it, and before you know it, the flu will be here, and you're not vaccinated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

            “These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.

            “These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”

            Despite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.

Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-and-gras-ingredients-information-consumers/understanding-how-fda-regulates-food-additives-and-gras-ingredients#:~:text=the%20FDA's%20review.-,Ingredients%20that%20are%20Generally%20Recognized%20as%20Safe%20(GRAS),the%20FDA's%20GRAS%20Notification%20Program." target="_blank"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Sodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat" target="_blank"&gt;carcinogen,&lt;/a&gt; with a direct link to colon cancer.

            Sorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000o3b6ptsry8snw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Potassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Acetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000r3b6pmi56vrc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Only two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Erythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Observational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.r2613" target="_blank"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; published with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000w3b6pn82ujmq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000x3b6pnm1z89w5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Type 2 diabetes and preservatives
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000y3b6p0uhn3up2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67360-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000z3b6pzjhn5bq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00103b6pjdniwh5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Five of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00113b6phjo4r3x2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00123b6pwp5zuzav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00133b6p0vlwyldt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00143b6pvhl4d4gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000g3b6pyj2eil8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000h3b6p5drfxv3h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000i3b6pj7cejcmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Type 2 diabetes and preservatives
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000y3b6p0uhn3up2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67360-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000z3b6pzjhn5bq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00103b6pjdniwh5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Five of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00113b6phjo4r3x2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00123b6pwp5zuzav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00133b6p0vlwyldt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00143b6pvhl4d4gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Health officials are &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/flu-hospitalizations-in-new-york-hit-record-high" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;urging&lt;/a&gt; residents to get vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fqs7i"&gt;But humans aren’t the only ones who can catch a version of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e6ota"&gt;Some veterinarians are warning that dog owners should also be aware of canine influenza, a separate virus that can infect pets and spread quickly in certain environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cj1k6"&gt;There have been at least 45 confirmed cases of H3N2, the most common strain of dog flu, reported across the U.S. so far this year, including in New Jersey, Connecticut and Vermont, according to one national outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/pet-owners/dogflu/outbreak-map/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt;. New York state recorded 1,157 tests for canine flu through mid-December, but none has come back positive as of Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="17gll"&gt;And while dogs can’t catch the flu from people, or vice versa, it’s still important for pet owners to understand the risks, according to Dr. Katja Lang, chief medical officer at &lt;a href="https://heartofchelsea.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heart of Chelsea Veterinary Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ges"&gt;“There is no relationship," Lang said. "Human flu, dog flu — both called influenza — but a human cannot give a dog flu, and a dog cannot give their flu to a human."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7m4tr"&gt;Lang stressed that there’s currently no outbreak of dog flu in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9nlho"&gt;She said symptoms of canine flu vary widely. Some dogs show no signs at all, while others develop coughing, nasal discharge, lethargy, decreased appetite or even pneumonia in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a06ql"&gt;“You can have a dog that has been exposed to the flu, that’s shedding and is contagious to other dogs and has zero symptoms,” she said. “That’s where it gets very tricky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="74qi1"&gt;The virus spreads easily in crowded environments like shelters, kennels or dog day cares, especially when there’s poor air circulation. And while some brachycephalic breeds, like pugs and French bulldogs, may be more prone to respiratory illness in general, Lang said no specific breed is more likely to contract the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3c8pt"&gt;“It’s considered highly contagious and when there are outbreaks, it spreads very quickly,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ik89"&gt;Lang recommends the canine flu vaccine for dogs who frequently interact with other dogs, like those in parks, boarding facilities or grooming salons. The vaccine won’t necessarily prevent infection, but can reduce the severity of symptoms if a dog is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2uv4f"&gt;“It’s a very safe and effective vaccine,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="986is"&gt;Lang urges any owner who suspects their dog has the flu to call their vet first, rather than walking into a clinic, which could expose other pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a9a9j"&gt;“There is a test that can be easily run where we swab their throat or their eyes and we send it out to a lab to confirm that this is the flu," Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cali7"&gt;The H3N2 canine influenza virus was first detected in South Korea in 2007 and has since been identified in dogs across Asia and North America, including in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/canine-flu.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQand2SnEwWGpITEtjd2Z0VVcxN2RjTHpUdGxWYmkxWnFRWERiX0xDeFlCVXl5azFYdFpPTHBtelJGdms1MExOVW1oMmNERS1YNDJVZXdKRHN1OHE5VEx5dEgydXBQbzVTUXNscnhVN0ctb3VRRE5LemZXd2kxcFJxYk5vZ0hNSk9JcEFVWGs3eEZ5RHJscVE1VQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，血液中的咖啡因可能会影响身体脂肪和糖尿病风险- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-might-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-shows</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP1A2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a gene that regulates it, called &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AHR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg" alt="Three coffees being held by hands" class="size-full wp-image-141100" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caffeine in your blood may help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

Children under the age of two are at higher risk. Parents should get their children ages six months and older vaccinated as soon as possible to decrease the risk of severe complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the flu is usually mild, it can cause hospitalization and death. Children under the age of two are at higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between December 14 to December 27, Boston reported a 126% increase in confirmed flu cases, and hospitalizations almost tripled. Massachusetts has now reported four pediatric flu deaths so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states have raised the alarm this week that flu activity is high. In South Carolina, health officials said there were nine flu-associated deaths in the last week of December, raising the total to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/2025-Flu-Watch-MMWR-WK-52.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the state for the 2025-26 season.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High percentage of clinic visits for fever, sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said that, nationwide, at least 11 million people have had the flu this season,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 120,000 have been hospitalized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for flu, and 5,000 people have died. The CDC is classifying this flu seasons as “moderately severe.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the flu activity is being driven by a strain of influenza A(H3N2) called &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subclade K, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;which caused early and high activity in Asia and the United Kingdom this fall. Experts warned&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;that subclade K was a mismatch for the current influenza vaccines, but recent preprint papers on &lt;span&gt;medRxiv&lt;/span&gt; suggest the current vaccine does elicit antibodies, and should provide at least some protection against &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449v1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infection and severe illness.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most telling markers of high influenza activity is outpatient clinic visits for influenza like illness (ILI). The CDC said 8.2% of patient visits reported through an ILI surveillance network were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat in the week ending on December 27.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of ILI visits has been above the national baseline of 3.1% for four consecutive weeks. Forty-eight health jurisdictions are reporting “high” or “very high” influenza activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of December 27, 2025, 42.5% of children in the United States had received a flu vaccination, the CDC said, which was similar to last season at this same time point (43.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the CDC said pediatric seasonal influenza vaccinations were no longer routinely recommended for all children 6 months and older in the United States, and instead suggested vaccine uptake should be decided via “shared clinical decision-making” between health care providers and parents.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts fear the move will push pediatric flu vaccine rates even lower.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the number of deaths in the 2023–24 respiratory season—an estimated 100,800—remained essentially the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adults 65 years and older shouldered a disproportionate share of the burden. Although they make up less than 20% of the US population, older adults accounted for nearly half (47.5%) of all COVID illnesses, roughly two-thirds (67.5%) of hospitalizations, and over 80% of deaths (81.3%) during the study period. On average, approximately 1 in 100 adults aged 65 years and older were hospitalized for COVID each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While COVID-19 burden estimates from October 2022 to September 2023 and from October 2023 to September 2024 indicate declines in hospitalizations and deaths compared with earlier years during the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial burden of COVID-19 disease persisted in the US in this period,” write the authors, adding that the virus “continues to disproportionately affect people 65 years and older whose immunity may wane faster than younger adults.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID still major threat to older Americans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an accompanying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2843387"&gt;&lt;span&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, David C. Grabowski, PhD, of Harvard Medical School, said the results make clear that COVID should still be viewed as a major threat to older Americans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“COVID-19 has had particularly devastating consequences for older adults, especially those frailest individuals receiving care in postacute and long-term care facilities,” he writes. “Based on the findings…we can assume COVID-19 will continue to have a major impact on health care use and mortality for the foreseeable future. Moreover, this impact will continue to be concentrated among older adults.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grabowski emphasizes that vaccines and antiviral treatments are effective at preventing severe disease and death, particularly in high-risk groups. But uptake among vulnerable populations has lagged. Only about 30% of nursing home residents are up to date with COVID booster doses, and just 17.9% of adults are up to date. What’s more, vaccine hesitancy is common among nursing home staff, with only about 7% current on their vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both the study and commentary emphasize the need for prevention measures, calling for a renewed focus on vaccination and increased access to antiviral treatments for high-risk populations, as well as investments in safer long-term care environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study participants reported their tea and coffee intake over the decade, while researchers regularly measured bone density in their hips and thighs—areas where fractures are most common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tea drinkers had slightly higher total bone density.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/drinking-black-coffee-can-help-you-live-longer-11770403" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking 2-3 cups of coffee per day&lt;/a&gt; did not affect bone health, while consuming more than five cups daily was associated with lower bone density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, in another recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, genetic analysis showed that higher coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis.

The researchers suggest that coffee may interfere with calcium absorption and bone metabolism, but the impact is minimal. Adding milk to coffee may help mitigate this effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea, specifically, may retain the most catechins and theaflavins due to its harvesting method and minimal processing, according to &lt;a href="https://stefanskinutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Stefanski, MEd, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian in York, PA, and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She said that these compounds are lower in black, white, and oolong tea.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea, for example, is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-should-you-wait-between-caffeine-and-bedtime-3014980" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in caffeine and may disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Having 3-4 cups of tea in addition to other beverages may increase how often you have to go to the bathroom. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stefanski said older adults should &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-coffee-bad-for-you-11833260" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consider limiting coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but not for the sake of strengthening bones.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some older adults are prone to drinking excessive amounts of coffee,” Stefanski said. “This often displaces more nutritious options, can cause stomach upset, and excessive caffeine can interrupt natural sleep patterns, leading to poor sleep quality.”&lt;br&gt;

            Flu is making people miserable from coast to coast, thanks in large part to a new strain called subclade K.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00042e6fuqauw48f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why infectious disease experts are telling people to run, not walk, to get this season’s flu shot if they haven’t yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00052e6f98e0o68o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you may be wondering whether getting a flu vaccine will still help or even if getting the vaccine might be riskier than getting sick. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help, and the flu is far riskier — but misinformation about vaccines is almost as rampant as the germs they protect against, and it can be hard to know what to believe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00062e6fptygbukt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are some of the most common myths about flu vaccines and what the science shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e7izr00002e6f1qfoor81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that people who get a flu shot are less likely to become severely ill, be hospitalized or die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ebi1a000c2e6fc0i5k47w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2008702124125831525" target="_blank"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, Jim O’Neill, acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a review by the US Department of Health and Human Services “found no randomized controlled trials demonstrating reduction of community transmission, hospitalizations, or mortality in children from the pediatric [flu] vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000h2e6fa9pff8mr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s right, says Dr. Mark Loeb, a flu researcher at McMaster University in Ontario – but that’s because randomized controlled trials aren’t the right tool for measuring severe outcomes of the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000i2e6f11r6bqd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For randomized controlled trials, most of them are underpowered to detect outcomes like even hospitalizations or deaths,” Loeb said, meaning they don’t have enough people in them to accurately detect differences in these outcomes, which are less common than infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000j2e6fx04o63pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loeb &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.org/article/S1198-743X(25)00474-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published a meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, or study of studies, in October in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection that included 165 observational studies with “test-negative designs,” which look at all the people who are treated for the same set of symptoms in an emergency room or clinic and then compare the vaccination status of those who tested positive for the flu against those who tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000k2e6f91ghax3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If a vaccine is effective, there will be fewer vaccinated people in the group that tests positive for the flu compared with those with the same symptoms who tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000l2e6fk13y7z43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Test-negative studies are powerful because they eliminate an important type of bias in observational studies: that people who go to the doctor may be generally more concerned about their health and more likely to get vaccinated than those who don’t go to the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4fy0no00013b6tvu6b9ebg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Together, the studies included more than 600,000 participants. They found that vaccines provide protection against severe flu complications at any age and regardless of how well the shots match the circulating flu strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000n2e6fywe37ux2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found that, on average, flu vaccines cut the risk of hospitalization or intensive care admission for children by about half and the risk of pneumonia by 70%. For adults up to 65, vaccination reduced the odds of hospitalization or pneumonia by 40%. Those over 65 saw a roughly 30% reduction in the risk of hospitalization, a 45% reduction in the risk of pneumonia and a 53% drop in the odds of needing intensive care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000o2e6fqj5jeltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it is particularly important year for people to get a flu shot, given the increased severity of the [virus] that’s circulating, and our paper provides good proof for this,” Loeb said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ebw67000f2e6f1paxxi13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that the current vaccine is still offering important protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ef429000t2e6flfx46rrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s true that there’s a new flu virus going around and that it’s not included in this year’s shots. But that doesn’t seem to be affecting how well the vaccines work as much as scientists first feared it might.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y000y2e6f420i7f28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Subclade K is an A-type flu strain, specifically an H3N2 virus.&lt;br&gt;H3N2 strains change quickly and often bedevil the best efforts of scientists to choose strains to include in each year’s vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y000z2e6fmxg4g4vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That happened this year. After the three strains for this year’s shots were chosen, H3N2 began circulating in the Southern Hemisphere, driving a record flu season in Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00102e6fgwup3eyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One big question has been how well this season’s flu shots protect against this new strain. Years when an H3N2 virus is the main driver of infections tend to have more severe disease, making answers about vaccine effectiveness even more urgent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00112e6f7gipmbqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s been mixed evidence on this point. World Health Organization scientists &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/who-influenza-recommendations/vcm-sh-2025/a.-26-september-2025-recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2026-southern-hemisphere-influenza-season---full-report.pdf?sfvrsn=eba6ad63_5&amp;amp;download=true" target="_blank"&gt;reported in September&lt;/a&gt; that the blood of ferrets vaccinated with the current season’s shots didn’t neutralize subclade K viruses very effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In November, though, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency analyzed nearly 8,000 emergency room visits and hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://ukhsa-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;and determined&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s flu shots were still surprisingly effective, despite subclade K mismatch. The vaccines cut the risk of kids needing to go to the emergency department or be hospitalized by about 75%. They reduced the same risks for adults by between 30% and 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00132e6fadknx4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine have weighed in. For a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449v1" target="_blank"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;,  published ahead of peer review, the research team took blood samples from 76 adults about a month after they’d gotten this year’s flu shot. They tested the serum, or the clear part of the blood, against several flu strains to see whether the antibodies in it could effectively recognize and bind to the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00142e6f1r2kccvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were surprised to find that many individuals that were vaccinated with this year’s vaccine produced substantial amounts of antibodies that could effectively bind and neutralize subclade K viruses,” study author Dr. Scott Hensley said. His lab is part of the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, a network of flu researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health, and they do rapid work to get answers to urgent question about the flu. Hensley said his team worked through their Thanksgiving break to complete the experiments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00152e6fa3174894@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before vaccination, only eight of the 76 study participants, or 11%, had neutralizing antibodies against subclade K viruses. After vaccination, 30 out of 76 people, or 39%, did.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00162e6fkv3x0qu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The message is very clear here,” Hensley said. “In years when there are antigenic mismatches, as is the case this year, the vaccine can still provide protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00172e6fvxenm05u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether or not a person made it into the group that developed antibodies against subclade K probably depends on what viruses they were exposed to in the past, Hensley said. So there’s no way of knowing whether you’d be in that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00182e6fjpsc6f3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t perfect, but if you can decrease your chance of getting flu this year by fourfold, man, that’s a vaccine that I want,” Hensley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4enlrw000w2e6few30z11b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that people may feel poorly shortly after the shot, but it’s not severe, and it’s not flu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4env8r001b2e6f1owawvl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plenty of people – about 1 in 3, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4467994/" target="_blank"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; — feel bad for a day or two after they get a flu shot. The most common symptoms include headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and fever, all of which can feel an awful lot like the flu itself. But it’s not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001i2e6fijkam4ay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s biologically impossible,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Because flu shots contain only pieces of the influenza virus, there’s no way these can cause an infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001j2e6fgwrvbrqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, we can get a sore arm that’s a little swollen, and some people may get a degree of fever and have a headache after receiving influenza vaccine, but that’s not the flu. That’s just your immune system responding to the vaccine that’s in the immediate period right after getting the vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001k2e6f2whwsjd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines may use slightly different technology, but they all work according to the same basic principle: They show the immune system a piece of a virus or bacteria so it will recognize and respond to the real thing more quickly. Think of your adorable preschooler sneezing in your face as you tuck them into bed or the stranger in the subway who coughs a cloud of germs in your direction. A vaccine primes your immune system to spring into action quickly after you’re exposed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001l2e6f9ivx8fsz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the process of building that immunity, vaccines can trigger inflammation. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4467994/" target="_blank"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; that tracked symptoms in 56 women in the days after their flu shots found that most reported a sore arm. This was generally mild and resolved within a day or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001m2e6f6vlood9k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten women reported bodywide symptoms like fatigue, headache or sore throat. Six women said their symptoms were gone after a day. Two had symptoms on the second day after vaccination, and one still had symptoms on the third day. Most described their symptoms as mild. Women who reported symptoms after their flu shot also had an increase in certain proteins in their blood that are markers for inflammation, leading the researchers to conclude that inflammation might be driving their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001n2e6flfb86thx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The good news is that everyone in the study developed protective antibodies against the flu, whether they experienced symptoms or not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4epnd7001g2e6fn4mhcykm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that you can still get the flu after vaccination, but the vaccine can protect from severe illness or death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eqb39001s2e6fiau3aqhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that flu vaccines do prevent some people from getting the flu, but in general, vaccines aren’t great at preventing respiratory infections, and it’s not really their main benefit. What they do best is prevent the worst consequences of flu infections: hospitalizations, pneumonia, heart attacks and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001x2e6fwnqdwxvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why: Vaccines create immunity all over your body in the form of Y-shaped scavengers called neutralizing antibodies.  These proteins have two outstretched arms that recognize specific places on flu viruses and latch on to block them from infecting cells. These antibodies live in your blood, the clear fluid that surrounds cells called lymph fluid, and in body tissues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001y2e6ffzta20zd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses usually enter the body through the moist tissues – the mucosa – that line our nose and throat. That’s where the infection begins. To stop an infection completely, vaccines would need to create more of a different type of antibody, called IgA antibodies, that lives in these mucosal tissues and could block the viruses from getting a foothold there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4gd50z00063b6tblu3tjxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccines — typically nasal sprays like FluMist — are designed specifically to create mucosal immunity. FluMist is one option for vaccination, and a good one for people who don’t like needles, but in general, injected vaccines have been shown to provide more consistent protection, especially for adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001z2e6fflih26n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu infections are typically mild when they get started. These early symptoms may feel awful, but they’re not nearly as serious as what happens days to weeks later if the infection moves into the lungs and turns into pneumonia or causes widespread inflammation, which increases the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03598-0" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt; like heart attacks and strokes. One study found the risk of a heart attack jumps sixfold in the week after a confirmed flu infection. Vaccination, on the other hand, cuts the risk of heart complications by 34% to 45%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4gdihu00083b6t7z4usoxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have also been &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836871" target="_blank"&gt;seeing more&lt;/a&gt; of a rare but serious complication called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, which causes brain damage after the flu. These complications are far more common in people who were not vaccinated before they got sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00202e6fdetmwu44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2514268?query=recirc_Semantic" target="_blank"&gt;updated evidence review&lt;/a&gt; looking at the effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19, RSV and influenza, published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that for children, flu vaccination cuts the risk of needing to see a doctor by about 55% and reduces the risk of hospitalization by 67%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00212e6fi26tb8hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So vaccination basically eliminated about two-thirds of the hospitalizations that would have occurred without it,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00222e6fh7oxsinj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For adults through age 64, flu vaccines cut the risk of needing to see a doctor or being hospitalized with the flu by 49% and 48%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00232e6f8v8kwrmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seniors, 65 and older, had a 41% and 42% reduced risk of needing to see the doctor or being hospitalized with the flu, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eqs0s001v2e6f7hkzdezw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can’t expect a shot that we get in our arm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to put up this magic force&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shield&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that blocks those respiratory viruses from entry in our nose, but they do prevent complications,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4etfr900262e6f0g46crcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that pediatricians still strongly recommend that most children get the flu vaccine every year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4euq1q002b2e6f2hdf5i0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;pared back&lt;/a&gt; the number of vaccines routinely recommended for American children, saying the decision to get a flu vaccine should be made only after consultation with a health care provider. Vaccinations against rotavirus, Covid-19, hepatitis A and B and meningitis are also now in this “talk to your doctor” category. HHS says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;these shots will still be covered by insurance if families want to get them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4evdb6002e2e6fx94vpvj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians and infectious disease experts have responded, saying that putting the shots in this category only increases barriers to vaccination and may prevent kids from getting needed protection against dangerous germs. They say they’ve long had discussions with patients about the benefits and risks of vaccines before offering the shots, so this doesn’t really change what they do in their practice. Instead, they say, the change suggests that there are safety issues that aren’t being discussed before families vaccinate children. It casts doubt on the safety of vaccines, despite the fact that there’s no new evidence of increased risks that would suggest such enhanced discussion are warranted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ewbw4002j2e6f47dyylmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some states and professional associations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they are following the science and &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34104/AAP-CDC-plan-to-remove-universal-childhood-vaccine?searchresult=1?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;continue to recommend&lt;/a&gt; annual flu shots for kids 6 months and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ewbw4002k2e6fyhyo7ged@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the last flu season, 280 children died of complications of the flu, a record for a non-pandemic year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. Of the children whose vaccine status was known, almost 90% of those who died were not fully vaccinated. Almost half who died had no underlying medical conditions before they got sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eysan00362e6f5m3jisxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that which flu shot you get depends on your age and your preferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4evzlq002h2e6fzi81lf62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starting in 2022, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that people 65 and older get stronger types of flu vaccines: those made with either a higher dose of active ingredients or those that have an added ingredient, called an adjuvant, that boosts immune response. Those are brand-named Fluad, Flublok or Fluzone high-dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002t2e6f643pewx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those three work better for older adults,” Schaffner said. “All of them provide about a 25% enhanced protection for people who are age 65 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002u2e6fopqvrwck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just as we physically become not as robust as we get older, such as when we were 22 years old and could run the hundred-yard dash very, very quickly, most of us can’t do that when we get older, so our immune system does not function as vigorously, and these three vaccines give an extra punch, if you will, to our immune system,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002v2e6f7abzdbeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who prefer to avoid needles, especially young kids and non-pregnant adults ages 18 to 49, the nasal spray called FluMist also offers good protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002w2e6fyd3ecekn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because FluMist contains a live but weakened form of the virus, it is not recommended for children younger than 2, adults 50 and older, pregnant women or those with immunity that’s been severely compromised by disease or immunosuppressive medications.
