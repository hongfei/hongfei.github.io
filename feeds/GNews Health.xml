              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every year, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-your-seasonal-allergies-seem-way-worse-right-now-1851395471"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pollen seasons grow longer and more intense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—to the great misery of those suffering from pollen allergies—myself included. There’s only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was the “simple but powerful idea” that inspired &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaznaru.edu.kz/en/sciences/agrotechnical-hubs/3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kaissar Tabynov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who led the efforts to create a “molecular shield” that intercepts allergens the moment they approach our airways. For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267181/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most common cause of pollen allergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Central Asia and Europe. Tabynov and colleagues reported the first proof-of-principle for this technology, in this instance with mice, in a paper published today in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1595659/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how the “shield” works. Researchers first develop a monoclonal antibody, or a lab-made protein designed to attach to a specific molecule. In this case it’s aimed at a major allergy-causing protein found in mugwort pollen. These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn’t disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they’re so insufferable), meaning Tabynov’s team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals’ natural antibodies. Although the duration of the treatment was shorter than Tabynov hoped, he told Gizmodo that he and his team have already devised a strategy to potentially make the treatment last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What’s exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. “Our approach is non-invasive, needle-free, and fast-acting [and] reduces the allergen load on the immune system and may help prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis into more severe conditions such as bronchial asthma.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. It’d also be a time-saving, cheaper alternative to immunotherapy sessions, which can take years to have any effect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, is this something we’ll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Depends. Tabynov’s most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment’s protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Then a pioneering experimental drug – 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB) – designed to bypass his genetic deficiency, not only halted his decline but restored his mobility in just weeks. Within weeks of compassionate‑use treatment approved by the FDA at NYU Langone, he walked again – hiking, go-karting, and playing with renewed vigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary case, the first human success for HPDL deficiency, signals a monumental shift in rare disease therapy, transforming despair into hope. It not only redefines treatment for HPDL deficiency but also shines a beacon of hope for rare mitochondrial diseases everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From an athlete to being &lt;keyword id="2282650" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="wheelchair-bound" source="Orion"&gt;wheelchair-bound&lt;/keyword&gt;: The onset of HPDL deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-2023, this otherwise healthy boy – a competitive runner and soccer enthusiast – started showing worrying signs: stumbling, ankle stiffness, and loss of coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began experiencing involuntary muscle contractions in his ankles while playing soccer. Within months, these symptoms escalated; by November, he needed a wheelchair and struggled even to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing at NYU Langone revealed biallelic mutations in the HPDL gene, essential for producing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a vital antioxidant for mitochondrial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPDL deficiency disrupts the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway, impairing cellular energy production. Without CoQ10, neurons and muscles lose function, leading to spasticity, paralysis, seizures, and often early death, with severe forms manifesting in infancy. In this child’s delayed-onset case, symptoms appeared later but progressed swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The CoQ10 conundrum: Why supplements aren’t enough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoQ10 is widely available as a dietary supplement and is generally safe. However, CoQ10 supplements are completely ineffective in HPDL cases affecting the brain because CoQ10 molecules are too large and hydrophobic to cross the blood–brain barrier. Without reaching the brain, supplemental CoQ10 offered minimal benefit, essentially leaving the underlying condition unchecked. While CoQ10 supplements may help peripheral tissues, they leave neurological symptoms – spasticity, paralysis, and rapid degeneration – untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A biochemical breakthrough: Smart ‘tailor-made’ solution&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers at NYU, led by Dr. Michael Pacold, discovered that HPDL catalyzes an early step in CoQ10 synthesis: converting 4‑hydroxy‑methyladenine (4‑HMA) to 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB), a precursor that is small and hydrophilic enough can cross the blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In HPDL-deficient mice, oral 4‑HB restored CoQ10 production, significantly improved neurological function, and rescued 90% of subjects when administered early. Translating this from mice to humans presented risks, but given the rapid deterioration and the absence of other options, the child's parents and medical team pursued a compassionate-use approval from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compassionate use in humans: Life-changing progress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November 2023, with the boy’s condition worsening and time running out, NYU’s team – led by Dr. Claire Miller – obtained FDA approval for single-patient investigational use of 4‑HB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment began in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the boy began daily oral doses of 4‑HB dissolved in water. Initial mood and side effects varied – he experienced nausea occasionally – but the potential benefits were undeniable. Remarkably, within just a month, he regained the ability to walk and walked more than half a mile in Central Park. His progress was profound. Over the next year, he completed a four‑mile hike and even enjoyed go-karting – all without serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors report a significant restoration of motor function and stamina. The boy can complete his daily activities without assistance—though rigorous sports remain off-limits. There have been no severe side effects reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact and perspective: A medical breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case represents the first successful application of 4‑HB therapy in a human with HPDL deficiency. Classified by experts as a "bench-to-bedside" success, it demonstrates how basic biological insights – like metabolic pathways – can be translated into transformative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacold highlighted the value of NIH-funded foundational research: without it, 4‑HB’s pathway to human use wouldn’t exist. However, experts emphasize that while the results are unprecedented, caution remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient’s outcome isn’t enough to define safety or efficacy broadly. Nevertheless, the experimental treatment offers proof-of-principle and has prompted plans for larger clinical trials across ages and HPDL variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broader implications for rare disease care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the potential of precision, mechanism-based therapies for ultra-rare genetic disorders – many of which lack approved treatments due to their complexity and small patient populations. It also illustrates how compassionate-use pathways can bridge the gap between preclinical research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For HPDL deficiency, this success sets the stage for larger clinical trials. Researchers are now exploring the treatment’s wider applicability and grappling with whether 4‑HB acts solely by restoring CoQ10 or if other mechanisms are at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A beacon of hope for rare disease communities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare genetic disorders often lack effective therapies due to low patient numbers and complex biology. This milestone highlights how customized, mechanism-based interventions can break new ground. It reiterates the importance of NIH-funded basic science – Pacold’s pathway elucidation stemmed from foundational grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Miller reflected on how “movement is identity and personality,” and described the turnaround as “heartwarming.” As the boy himself reportedly asked, "When are you going to make this a pill?" – a reminder of evolving patient-driven optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s ahead now? Next steps focus on clinical expansion: enrolling more pediatric patients, refining dosing, and assessing long-term outcomes. Scientists also aim to clarify whether 4‑HB works solely by boosting CoQ10 or also via unexpected mechanisms. Additionally, assessing whether similar treatments can address broader CoQ10 deficiencies is a promising, yet cautious, discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;This is how Aryan Khan spent the money in jail that he received from his father Shah Rukh Khan: Reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 03:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病：常见咳嗽糖浆可减缓认知能力下降和痴呆症-印度时报 | Parkinson’s disease: Common cough syrup revealed to slow down cognitive decline and dementia - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. It is narked not only by motor symptoms – such as tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia – but also by cognitive decline. PD is also characterized by the degeneration and death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger crucial for smooth and coordinated muscle movements. This loss of dopamine leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, up to half of people with PD develop Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) within a decade, with symptoms ranging from memory loss and confusion to hallucinations and mood disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a groundbreaking phase 2 clinical trial has revealed that a common cough medicine can stabilize psychiatric symptoms and potentially slow cognitive decline in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The recent discovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a clinical trial, Ambroxol, a common cough medicine (used in Europe), has shown promise in slowing cognitive decline in people with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 12-month study conducted by researchers at Lawson Research Institute found that Ambroxol helped stabilise psychiatric symptoms, improved cognitive function, and protected against brain damage in genetically at-risk participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2835760" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared the outcome of the expectorant Ambroxol with a placebo among participants with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While primary and secondary outcomes were similar, participants on the placebo experienced worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to symptoms remaining the same in the intervention group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed a possible improvement in cognitive symptoms for people with variants of a particular gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Parkinson’s Dementia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease dementia is a progressive condition superimposed on the classic movement symptoms of PD. It typically manifests in the later stages of the disease and includes cognitive impairment – memory lapses, executive dysfunction, visual hallucinations, and mood disturbances like depression or apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 153,000 people in the UK live with PD. There is currently no cure for PDD, but patients can take medications called cholinesterase inhibitors to help manage symptoms. Existing treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine, donepezil) and memantine, may provide some symptomatic relief but fail to halt or alter the underlying neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambroxol: From cough syrup to neuroprotection&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol has been widely used in Europe for decades as a mucoactive agent – it helps clear phlegm and has an excellent safety profile. Its potential in neurodegenerative disease stems from its ability to enhance glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, a key enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene. Reduced GCase activity leads to the build-up of alpha-synuclein, a hallmark of PD and PDD. By enhancing GCase, Ambroxol may promote the clearance of pathological proteins and reduce brain cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key findings from the phase 2 trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Lawson Research Institute conducted a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 55 PDD patients, administering high-dose Ambroxol (525–1,050 mg/day). The major outcomes included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptom stabilization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Placebo participants experienced significant worsening in neuropsychiatric measures, while those on Ambroxol remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Brain injury marker (GFAP):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serum GFAP – a biomarker of neuronal damage – increased in the placebo group but remained stable with Ambroxol, implying neuroprotective action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cognitive improvement in high-risk individuals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients harboring GBA1 risk variants exhibited noticeable cognitive gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safety and tolerance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ambroxol was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse effects noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detailed report noted that high-dose Ambroxol recipients showed improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores by approximately 2 points, while placebo subjects declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and the way ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While findings are promising, they come from a small, single-center Phase 2 trial with limited diversity and may not be fully statistically conclusive. Certain dose‑response relationships remain unclear, and the subset of GBA1 carriers was small – about eight participants. Researchers are planning larger Phase 3 clinical trials in 2025 to specifically evaluate cognitive outcomes and determine optimal dosing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The parting thought&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol’s success could inspire wider interest in repurposing safe, existing medications for neurodegenerative disorders. It also supports the hypothesis that enhancing GCase activity may combat alpha-synuclein pathologies – a concept applicable to Parkinson’s, dementia with Lewy bodies, and potentially Gaucher disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this study draws attention to the value of targeted precision medicine – showing particular promise in patients with genetic risk factors (e.g., GBA1 variants).

One session a month was all it took to be classed as “active,” yet even that light commitment predicted larger volumes in the hippocampus, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;brain’s&lt;/a&gt; chief memory hub. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared cognitive test scores with early Alzheimer markers like amyloid build‑up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who kept moving scored higher even when those markers were present, suggesting exercise builds mental resilience rather than erasing the pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults typically lose about one to two percent of hippocampal volume every year. Aerobic training can add roughly two percent back, effectively buying an extra year or two of neurological youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3072565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; link that gain to boosts in blood flow, new neuron growth, and surges of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that primes synapses for learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human scans echo the trend, showing fitter seniors with denser hippocampal tissue and sharper spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-and-hidden-alzheimer-s"&gt;Exercise and hidden Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Insight 46 scans did not find a direct link between activity and the amount of amyloid lodged in the brain’s cortex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That matches other population &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31312836/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; where exercise softened the cognitive hit of amyloid without always lowering the plaques themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23079557/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; think movement may raise the threshold at which damage turns into symptoms, a concept known as cognitive reserve. Reserve acts like a backup network, letting healthy circuits pick up slack when disease strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-following-participants-for-70-years"&gt;Following participants for 70 years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Insight 46 study is part of the world’s longest-running birth cohort, the 1946 &lt;a href="https://nshd.mrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British National Survey of Health and Development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants have been assessed regularly since childhood, providing researchers with a rare, detailed view of their lifelong health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 70, five hundred and two of these individuals underwent memory testing, PET scans to detect amyloid, and MRI scans to assess brain volume and hippocampal size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination of decades-long physical activity records and brain imaging allowed researchers to connect early-life exercise habits with structural and functional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-literally-changes-based-on-daily-activities-and-lifestyle/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; markers nearly 40 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-show-bigger-benefits"&gt;Women show bigger benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in the study saw the strongest benefits. Inactive women with amyloid deposits showed steeper memory loss than inactive men, yet a modest exercise habit erased much of that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal shifts after menopause and higher baseline Alzheimer risk may make female brains more sensitive to lifestyle. That &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/12/701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; means the upside of activity could be bigger too, offering a practical target for prevention campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise joins education, mentally demanding work, and social connection as major reserve builders. Each factor strengthens neural networks in different ways, so combining them multiplies protection over decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly half of dementia cases can be prevented or delayed by addressing health and lifestyle risk factors,” notes researcher &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research/online-public-events/for-a-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Thomas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7392084/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; estimated that up to forty percent of dementia cases could be delayed or avoided by tackling modifiable risks, with physical inactivity sitting near the top of the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-for-your-brain-before-50"&gt;Exercise for your brain before 50&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need marathon medals to reap &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-speed-at-which-the-brain-processes-information/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; dividends. The study’s cutoff of one leisure session per month hints that consistency beats intensity for long‑term payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting after 50 still helped but earlier movers enjoyed the largest hippocampi at 70, implying that earlier habits leave a structural imprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-cuts-early-death-risks-by-53-percent/"&gt;Cardiorespiratory&lt;/a&gt; fitness later in life can still blunt the link between Alzheimer biomarkers and thinking decline, yet earlier routines give extra cushioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidelines call for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity each week, but any added movement counts. Regular walks, cycling to errands, or weekend dance classes all meet the threshold and most involve no special gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to run with people because you keep each other accountable and stay connected,” said Graham Kent, a 74‑year‑old participant, while caring for his wife who lives with Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging friends or pets can double as social enrichment, another pillar of reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message lands clearly: move early, move often, and keep moving. A future cure would be welcome, but personal prevention starts with the next stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/1/fcae431/7933115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:05:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNclJtZzQtcFEzYmJfWFdXRWJ5b29pWngwbDFtRXUtbllqTTJRby12RUZIbmZCVFpxbE1UcU9BcUpKeVZ1cm5TUTBLV2xHVTlYQjB2WXNobFpvZU1OQkdFX19xZ0I0V3NfekZydmZPTlVJUWVRT1lfOXVfQXk4THFyS28xQUNjQ2Zqd3dtNHgxYVllYW1SdlQ3cU9fcTBIT3Zia2RWZzZZNA</guid></item><item><title>“自动对焦”规格可保证近距离或远距离的锐利视野- BBC | 'Autofocus' specs promise sharp vision, near or far - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE95bzBPb1NKS0ZfOVJBUzhEZTlKelQ1ZVpROTdKSVMwa2RkVTAwZTJQb3N3YUJyUHVEZm5ZeTVPSlM0bkdrZXAxZE1zZk5kWE1kakJhVlVxVGhyd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1qUXV6cXdEYkVOM3FuZEx3Y2hWb1hjdTMxUmJKM2I4Q3NJcGw5dnJpNFVXSldxVld2SkhkNjhhNl9JbmllV1E5Umh5cll1eEtJX1REN3JnWlhxVFNiVHJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'Autofocus' specs promise sharp vision, near or far&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Chris Baraniuk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology Reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp" loading="eager" alt="IXI Niko Eiden, smiling and wearing IXI's autofocus specs." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;IXI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;"People don't want to look like cyborgs," says Niko Eiden&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They look like an ordinary pair of glasses – but these are tech-packed specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On a Zoom call, Niko Eiden, chief executive and co-founder of Finnish eyewear firm IXI, holds up the frames with lenses containing liquid crystals, meaning their vision-correcting properties can change on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This one pair could correct the vision of someone who normally uses totally different pairs of glasses for seeing near or far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These liquid crystals… we can rotate them with an electrical field," explains Mr Eiden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's totally, freely tuneable." The position of those crystals affects the passage of light through the lenses. A built-in eye-tracker allows the glasses to respond to whatever correction the wearer needs at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, tech-laden eyewear &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-30830265" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;has a troubled history&lt;/a&gt; – take Google's ill-fated "Glass" smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Consumer acceptability is key, acknowledges Mr Eiden.

And myopia, or short-sightedness, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8g4xpjz65o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is also on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Spectacles have remained largely the same for decades. Bifocal lenses – in which a lens is split into two regions, usually for either near- or far-sightedness – require the wearer to direct their vision through the relevant region, depending on what they want to look at, in order to see clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Varifocals do a similar job but the transitions are much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In contrast, auto-focus lenses promise to adjust part or all of the lens spontaneously, and even accommodate the wearer's changing eyesight over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The first lenses that we produced were horrible," admits Mr Eiden, candidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those early prototypes were "hazy", he says, and with the lens quality noticeably poor at its edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions have proved promising in tests, says Mr Eiden. Participants in the company's trials have been asked, for example, to read something on a page, then look at an object in the distance, to see whether the glasses respond smoothly to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden says that the eye tracking device within the spectacles cannot determine exactly what a wearer is looking at, though certain activities such as reading are in principle detectable because of the nature of eye movements associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since such glasses respond so closely to the wearer's eye behaviour, it's important the frames fit well, says Emilia Helin, product director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;IXI's frames are adjustable but not to a great degree, given the delicate electronics inside, she explains: "We have some flexibility but not full flexibility." That's why IXI hopes to ensure that the small range of frames it has designed would suit a wide variety of faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The small battery secreted inside IXI's autofocus frames should last for two days, says Mr Eiden, adding that it's possible to recharge the specs overnight while the wearer is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he won't be drawn on a launch date, which he intends to reveal later this year. As for cost, I ask whether £1,000 might be the sort of price tag he has in mind. He merely says, "I'm smiling when you say it but I won't confirm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A mother tries on glasses in a store with her young daughter" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals, says Paramdeep Bilkhu, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he adds, "There is insufficient evidence to state whether they perform as well as traditional options and whether they can be used for safety critical tasks such as driving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chi-Ho To, an optometry researcher, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has a similar concern – what if the vision correction went wrong or was delayed slightly while he was, say, performing surgery on someone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But I think in terms of general use having something that allows autofocusing is a good idea," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden notes that the first version of his company's lenses will not alter the entire lens area. "One can always glance over the dynamic area," he says. If wholly self-adjusting lenses emerge then safety will become "a much more serious business", he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2013, UK firm Adlens released glasses that allowed wearers to manually change the optical power of the lenses via a small dial on the frames. These lenses contained a fluid-filled membrane, which when compressed in response to dial adjustments would alter its curvature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Adlens' current chief executive Rob Stevens says the specs sold for $1,250 (£920) in the US and were "well received by consumers" but not so much by opticians, which he says "strangled sales".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, technology has moved on and the concept of lenses that refocus themselves automatically, without manual interventions, has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like IXI and other companies, Adlens is working on glasses that do this. However, Mr Stevens declines to confirm a launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Joshua Silver, an Oxford University physicist, founded Adlens but no longer works for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He came up with the idea of fluid-filled adjustable lenses back in 1985 and developed glasses that could be tuned to the wearer's needs and then permanently set to that prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Such lenses have enabled roughly 100,000 people in 20 countries to  access vision correcting technology. Prof Silver is currently seeking investment for a venture called Vision, which would further rollout these glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for more expensive, electronics-filled auto-focus specs, he questions whether they will have broad appeal: "Wouldn't [people] just go and buy reading glasses, which would more or less do the same thing for them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hong Kong Polytechnic University Prof Chi-Ho To holding up a lens." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Hong Kong Polytechnic University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Prof Chi-Ho To has developed a lens which slows short-sightedness&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Other specs tech is even slowing down the progression of eye conditions such as myopia, beyond just correcting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof To &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32700-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;has developed glasses lenses&lt;/a&gt; that have a honeycomb-like ring in them.

   &lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Decades of progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS are in danger of unraveling, the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warned Thursday in its annual report, citing sharp funding cuts from major donors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/UNAIDS-global-AIDS-update-2025" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, launched in South Africa by UNAIDS, says those cuts — especially the sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding — are threatening to reverse gains that have saved millions of lives over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If the world doesn't plug this hole," said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, "we estimate that an additional six million people will be newly infected in the next four years. We could have four million additional AIDS-related deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The reports warning comes five months after the Trump administration&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt; halted most funding&lt;/a&gt; for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — the largest single contributor to the global HIV/AIDS response. The decision was made with little warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The sudden withdrawal of the single biggest HIV donor is putting this progress at risk," Byanyima said during a press briefing in Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the start of the epidemic, UNAIDS says 26.9 million lives have been saved through treatment efforts — many of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77071" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fallout in South Africa and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;South Africa, which has the world's largest population of people living with HIV, has made major strides. Most of those infected now receive life-saving antiretroviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the fallout is already being felt. At the report's launch, South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi called the U.S. cuts "a wake-up call" — and warned of the dangers of depending on a single donor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This type of relationship where we depend on one country, and when that country is in some type of negative mood, the whole world collapses — yes, it's scary," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scientific setbacks and a call to action&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;South African researchers have been at the forefront of global HIV breakthroughs as well as COVID-19 studies. But many trials are now being suspended due to lack of funds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Helen Rees, head of the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, said the implications are global.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The research being done for HIV and tuberculosis in South Africa has not only had an impact here, but a huge global impact," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rees was recently honored by the World Health Organization for her "outstanding contribution to public health," but her institute is now facing major U.S. funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Not charity" — a shared fight&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trump has said &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462613/africa-leaders-trump-white-house-china-minerals-oil" target="_blank"&gt;the shift away from U.S. aid &lt;/a&gt;reflects a new emphasis on "trade over charity" in Africa. But UNAIDS' Byanyima says the sudden withdrawal of U.S. support in February has left UNAIDS with nearly 50% less funding — and no time to prepare for the gap.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is not charity," she said. "This is solving a global problem together. As long as it festers in some parts of the world, it will come back to hit everybody else."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For longtime HIV activist Nombeko Mpongo in Cape Town, the cuts have felt deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I remember for a few days I felt suffocated, I felt like being choked… It was like a volcano came and took everything away. It felt like a death penalty," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But after the shock, Mpongo says she rallied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I realized — no man, nonsense. Let me fight. Let me reach out to the communities," she said. "We've fought this virus before. We'll do it again, because hope is what is going to carry us through."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)—29% and 85%, respectively—finds a large medical records study published online in the journal &lt;i&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;What's more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition—18–64-year-olds—the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuropathic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuropathic pain&lt;/a&gt;, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including whether particular age groups might be more vulnerable, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/real-time+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;real-time data&lt;/a&gt; from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from 68 health care organizations across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They scrutinized the anonymized records of adult patients who had and hadn't been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64-year-olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn't been prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was no heightened risk among 18–34-year-olds prescribed the drug, the risks of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49-year-olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between three and 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/observational+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;observational study&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren't able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude, "Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They add, "Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A 57-year-old woman spent six days in the hospital for severe liver damage after taking daily megadoses of the popular herbal supplement, turmeric, which she had seen touted on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liver-damage-turmeric-supplement-woman-hospitalized-rcna217578"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman, Katie Mohan, told the outlet that she had seen a doctor on Instagram suggesting it was useful against inflammation and joint pain. So, she began taking turmeric capsules at a dose of 2,250 mg per day. According to the World Health Organization, an acceptable daily dose is &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/638"&gt;up to 3 mg&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of weight per day—for a 150-pound (68 kg) adult, that would be about 204 mg per day. Mohan was taking more than 10 times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, she developed stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, and dark urine. "I just did not feel well generally," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing a news report about the possibility of toxicity from turmeric, she connected her symptoms to the pills and went to urgent care. Blood tests revealed her liver enzyme levels were 60 times higher than the normal limit, suggesting liver damage. She was admitted to a local hospital and then transferred to NYU Langone in New York City. Her hepatologist there, Nikolaos Pyrsopoulos, said she was "one step before full liver damage, liver failure, requiring liver transplant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rare toxicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, turmeric—a golden-colored staple of curries—is not harmful, particularly in foods. But, as herbal supplements have gained popularity and doses have gotten larger, doctors have reported &lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext"&gt;a rise in liver injuries from the spice&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, while rare overall, turmeric appears to have become the most common herbal cause of liver injuries in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a major source of frustration for the mother of two young children. Standing up can cause her to black out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e5cee" class="body-graf"&gt;“Things that I feel like I should be able to do cause pain pretty quickly, and then I kind of have to tap out,” said McCausland, 30, of West Valley City, Utah. “Getting down to play with my kids is really hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-264ab6"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg" alt="Aurora McCausland."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Aurora McCausland first noticed symptoms of lipedema as a teenager.

He performs a specialized type of liposuction that removes the diseased tissue to restore mobility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f7568" class="body-graf"&gt;The procedure isn’t cosmetic, and despite the buildup of fat, lipedema isn’t related to obesity. It’s not caused by overeating or inactivity. It’s a hormonally driven &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/inflammation-how-protect-body-against-chronic-disease-rcna193856" target="_blank"&gt;inflammatory condition&lt;/a&gt;, one that’s largely resistant to diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It goes against the more traditional health dogma that’s out there about normal fat,” Smart said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e611a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Lipedema is almost exclusively seen in women, but scientists don’t have a good handle on how many are affected. &lt;a href="https://lipedema.net/how-prevalent-is-lipedema-in-women/" target="_blank"&gt;Some estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may affect up to 11% of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21ae88" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are no large-scale, population-based epidemiologic estimates. We don’t have blood tests. We don’t have imaging studies,” said Dr. Aaron Aday, co-director of vascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7c7ae8" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denied relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bae22" class="body-graf"&gt;Many women first notice symptoms of lipedema at puberty, and the disease often worsens during major hormonal shifts like pregnancy or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/non-hormonal-menopause-drugs-symptoms-insurance-hurdles-rcna152439" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-19305d" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland said her symptoms first appeared during her early teens: leg pain, swelling and bruising from the slightest touch. “I thought it was just growing pains,” she said. Fat built up around her ankles. No matter how physically active she was — dancing and CrossFit were two hobbies — she couldn’t make the fat in her lower legs go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a72229" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, she was told it was just excess weight. “That if I worked out more, ate less, it would go away,” she said. “But no matter what I did, my legs just hurt more. I was doing everything right and getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-912ee4" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:Costofdenial@nbcuni.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8e9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland’s five sisters experienced similar symptoms. She said none knew what the problem was until one of the sisters got liposuction to slim down her lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05cda9" class="body-graf"&gt;But lipedema fat isn’t the same as typical fat. Instead of feeling soft, it can feel like hard nodules under the skin. Regular liposuction can be risky to use on lipedema patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e569a" class="body-graf"&gt;It took far longer than it should have for her sister’s doctor to do the procedure, McCausland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-818153" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctor ended up giving her third-degree internal burns all on her legs, because he didn’t know that it wasn’t normal fat. He just kept going, having to go over and over and over trying to remove it,” she said. “It was just this horrible thing that happened. Obviously the doctor had no idea that she had this condition, and neither did my sister.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-244393" class="body-graf"&gt;Aday — who hasn’t treated McCausland — said that a specialized type of liposuction, performed by a surgeon with extensive knowledge of lipedema, is the most effective way to treat the disorder. It can reverse symptoms in many people. Some patients, he said, may have to have the procedure repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9dd69c" class="body-graf"&gt;The Roxbury Institute said that McCausland would need two liposuction surgeries, totaling more than $35,000. But her former insurance provider, Cigna Healthcare, denied coverage for the procedure twice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fece8f" class="body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, a Cigna representative said: “Lipedema is a painful condition that disproportionately impacts women, and we cover a range of treatment options, including liposuction, for patients that meet evidence-based clinical criteria. Ms. McCausland’s case was carefully reviewed by multiple doctors, including a plastic surgeon with expertise in lipedema. Based on the information submitted by her doctor, she did not meet the clinical criteria for liposuction at that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41d15e" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland believes her coverage was denied because she didn’t look sick enough, adding that she suspects the denial was based on her social media posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99f394" class="body-graf"&gt;They said “that it’s not medically necessary,” McCausland said. “That’s absurd. They’re not looking at how I live. They’re looking at a photo and deciding I don’t look bad enough to be helped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-648acd" class="body-graf"&gt;Cigna told NBC News that social media isn’t considered when it makes coverage decisions. “Our coverage decisions are based on the clinical information submitted by a patient’s treating physician in accordance with coverage policies and the patient’s plan design,” the representative said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffd6b5" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland’s health insurance has since switched to MotivHealth, because of her husband’s new job. McCausland said MotivHealth has already suggested to her in a phone call that it’s not a procedure it usually covers but that she can submit additional documentation. A representative for the company didn’t respond to several requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-0ab819" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long under-recognized disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9028cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Lipedema is categorized in four stages, based on visual appearance. Stage 1 looks like minor fat accumulation and Stage 4 appears as severe leg disfigurement. Appearance, however, doesn’t always match the severity of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eb303" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can have a Stage 1 patient that has very severe and crippling symptoms of pain and swelling, and somebody who is maybe more progressed visibly that doesn’t have such severe symptoms,” Smart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54aea0" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland is a prime example. She doesn’t look sick, according to some commenters on her social media videos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6d7e14"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg" alt="Aurora McCausland."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;McCausland said her legs throb with pain, swell unpredictably and feel heavy, like they’re filled with cement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Aurora McCausland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a20a36" class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve gotten a handful of people saying, ‘Well, I’ve looked at your other videos, and I agree with your insurance company,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c9791" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is very likely the reason why lipedema has been so under-recognized for such a long time,” Smart said. “So many people, so many insurance companies, so many physicians, have been telling lipedema patients for decades to just ‘work out, eat better, lose weight,’ when that’s not actually the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-68ef4f" class="body-graf"&gt;He said waiting until the condition progresses is dangerous. Without treatment, lipedema advances, causing more inflammation, worsening pain and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/knees-running-osteoarthritis-marathoners-orthopedic-rcna71270" target="_blank"&gt;permanent joint damage&lt;/a&gt;. The longer surgery is delayed, the harder it is to restore mobility in later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f28ea2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really unfortunate for Aurora, because at that early stage, it is less likely that she gets insurance coverage,” Smart said. “They’re not looking at the severity of her symptoms. They’re not looking at the severity of her pain, the decrease in mobility, her lack of ability to be able to perform those daily activities of living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd97af" class="body-graf"&gt;Jonathan Kartt, chief executive officer of the Lipedema Foundation, said that the pain experienced by women with lipedema can be measured objectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9476e" class="body-graf"&gt;Using a tool to measure how patients perceive stimuli like temperature and touch, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11013692/" target="_blank"&gt;researchers in Germany found&lt;/a&gt; that women with lipedema had a lower pain threshold compared with other women.

The neurobiologist Steven Rose, who has died aged 87, took a broadly reductionist approach to his research into biochemical mechanisms of memory, while at the same time adopting a high-profile political stance against the idea that human behaviour is determined by our genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Less publicly but equally influentially, as the first biology professor to be appointed at the Open University – the distance-learning institution founded through a Labour government initiative in 1969 – Rose helped to pioneer a democratic and distributed approach to teaching practical science. He developed experiments that students could complete at home, pooling their results and prefiguring many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/16/the-rise-of-citizen-science-can-the-public-help-solve-our-biggest-problems" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“citizen science” projects&lt;/a&gt; that have become popular in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"science","tags":[{"id":"science/neuroscience","type":"Keyword","title":"Neuroscience"},{"id":"tone/obituaries","type":"Tone","title":"Obituaries"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"education/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"science/science-scepticism","type":"Keyword","title":"Science and scepticism"},{"id":"books/scienceandnature","type":"Keyword","title":"Science and nature books"},{"id":"education/openuniversity","type":"Keyword","title":"Open University"},{"id":"science/biology","type":"Keyword","title":"Biology"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"education/education","type":"Keyword","title":"Education"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"profile/georgina-ferry","type":"Contributor","title":"Georgina Ferry"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/obituaries","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Obituaries"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-obituaries","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Obituaries"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"science/2025/jul/10/steven-rose-obituary","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Impassioned, combative and articulate, Rose gave no quarter in his debates with fellow scientists. In the 1970s he challenged the idea that IQ tests – then being widely adopted in education and employment – measured some genetically determined “general intelligence”. This and subsequent debates played out in a wider cultural arena than is typical of most scientific debates, fuelled by a series of popular books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;His principal targets were the entomologist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/06/edward-o-wilson-obituary" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Edward O Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, author of Sociobiology, and the evolutionary theorist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/29/selfish-gene-40-years-richard-dawkins-do-ideas-stand-up-adam-rutherford" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/a&gt;, later joined by the cognitive neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Steven Pinker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To Rose, the idea that the roots of human social behaviour had been planted through the process of natural selection in the service of perpetuating our genes was anathema. While he did not question Darwinian evolution as a driving force in biology, he argued from a Marxist perspective that history and society were at least as important as determinants of human actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 1984 Rose co-authored Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature, together with the American geneticist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/28/richard-lewontin-obituary" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Richard Lewontin&lt;/a&gt; and psychologist Leon Kamin. The book was a trenchant critique of sociobiology and genetic determinism, and went further in blaming such views for the failure to create a fairer society based on socialist principles. It met with mixed reviews, including the suggestion that he and his co-authors had misrepresented the views of their opponents, but Rose never retreated from his position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than a decade later, in Lifelines (1997), he restated his arguments, highlighting the developmental and environmental events that take place across a lifetime that are not predetermined but through which an organism “self-organises” to become a unique individual. He wrote: “It is in the nature of living systems to be radically indeterminate, to continually construct their – our – own futures, albeit in circumstances not of our own choosing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On first becoming a neurobiologist, Rose consciously chose an important problem to investigate. What is it that changes, biologically, when we learn? Trained as a biochemist, he pursued the hypothesis that some change in the biochemistry of individual brain cells must underlie the enduring traces of memory. He devoted his research career to looking for those traces, in the form of new protein molecules, in the brains of newly hatched chicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While he acknowledged that human memory raises far larger questions, he and his colleagues worked on this problem because it was “what we know how to study”. By the time of his retirement he and &lt;a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/rm32.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Radmila Mileusnic &lt;/a&gt;had identified protein molecules that could counteract the amnesic effects of antibiotics on learning in chicks, and were hoping to develop them as treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Like others, however, they ran up against the problem that the brain puts up barriers to such large molecules, so that they cannot be given as pills or injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rose was a compulsive writer, words flowing as easily in print as they did in person, weaving science, society and politics into a single whole. While still in his 20s he published The Chemistry of Life (1966), a hugely successful Penguin paperback explaining the basics of biochemistry to the general reader. His book The Making of Memory: From Molecules to Mind (1992) received the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/royal-society-science-book-prize" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Royal Society science book prize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of his later works, The 21st Century Brain, succinctly summarised the achievements of neuroscientists in recent decades, but also warned that science could not always provide the best answers to questions about the mind, consciousness and mental illness. While Rose championed science as an approach to understanding the natural world, he devoted at least as much of his considerable energy to critiques of the relationship between science and the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Steven was born into an Orthodox Jewish community in north London, the elder son of Lionel Rose (formerly Rosenberg), a chemistry teacher who became an intelligence officer during the second world war. Lionel subsequently worked full-time as an organiser for the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women before founding an advertising agency. Steven’s mother, Ruth (nee Waxman), gave up her own career aspirations to care for her home and family, but later became co-director of her husband’s agency and ran it single-handed after he died in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Steven won a scholarship to Haberdashers’ Aske’s boys’ school, then in Cricklewood, north London. Another scholarship took him to study natural sciences at King’s College, Cambridge, where he initially intended to specialise in chemistry. But he found himself in an environment buzzing with new discoveries in biochemistry, including the DNA double helix proposed by James Watson and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/30/obituaries.science" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Francis Crick&lt;/a&gt; at the Medical Research Council Unit for Molecular Biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With a double first in biochemistry, Rose decided to use his new tools to tackle one of the hardest problems in biology – how the brain works. Cambridge “exiled” him to the Institute of Psychiatry in London to study the biochemistry of slices of cow brain for his PhD. Rose spoke of his frustration at this, saying: “We might as well have been studying big toes or livers or kidneys for all it told me about function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He met Hilary Chantler (nee Channell), a recently widowed mature student reading sociology at London School of Economics, at a New Left Review meeting in 1960, and they married the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Political action and protest had been part of his life since childhood – his community came under attack from fascist stone-throwers in the late 40s, and as an undergraduate he had joined in running battles with the police while demonstrating against the invasion of Suez. Steven and Hilary formed a close partnership, both personal and professional: Hilary co-authored several of his books, they were founder members of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science, and they jointly held the honorary lectureship post of Gresham professor of physic from 1999 until 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hilary became professor of social policy at the University of Bradford, with a particular interest in the sociology of science, and they were united in their (broadly Marxist, but not pro-Soviet) political activism on issues such as the Vietnam war, the control of chemical and biological weapons and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/06/israel.guardianletters" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a boycott of Israeli academic institutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After a false start as a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University, which he found stiflingly reactionary, Rose spent five years (1964-69) at Imperial College London. There he developed the technique of looking for biochemical changes in single neurons in the brains of chicks after they learned a new behaviour, the basis of his subsequent research work. In 1969 he joined the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/openuniversity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt;, building the department of life sciences from scratch, and working out from first principles how one might teach science through a combination of home study and experiment, television programmes and summer schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He retired in 1999, but retained his laboratory and continued to conduct research for more than a decade. Reflecting on the values that underpinned his work for the OU, he told an oral history interviewer: “In a democratic society if you want to share power, you have to share knowledge and you have to share the knowledge of science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He is survived by Hilary, their two sons, Simon (from Hilary’s first marriage) and Ben, and six grandchildren, Sara, Chloe, Woody, Cosmo, Saul and Mali, and by his brother, Nikolas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5mNFhPYjRfTkF0ZTgtbk9pQkNMM09HYy1QSEJtTmFaazhXZGNlNXI2XzdNR2VXbTJzck9BVlp4Ml9vNXJJVUhSdlBIOFdsd05FclIzNWgyYzJwcjdJS3JRMVV0WlFXcGsyQXhqQlJjWU9xWXhLY3hV</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，避免麻疹生病的5种最佳方法-《华盛顿邮报》 | 5 best ways to avoid getting sick with measles, according to experts - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5lXzZrclBNaVNnTV9JQTJoRk5NYUphWHdENUktaDNIOHdreVQ4SjRUMTF6LWJzMDlTdEUyWVozRTJPUTZsa0ZCeGk4LWU0dkVDYVpqejc2OFQxOHNfTGZ1SUFDOHhldEpaTFI2V3RwN1ozVlZlNDVNYjhVdHQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K77HMK56P5CEXOSBTHOHCLBPRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles cases in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/07/measles-cases-hit-record/" target="_blank"&gt;hit a sobering milestone&lt;/a&gt; this week. As of Wednesday, when the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; last updated its weekly count, 1,288&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cases had been confirmed in 2025, more than in any year since 1992.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“And we’re just halfway through the year,” said &lt;a href="https://www.research.vt.edu/contacts/lee-lisa.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lisa Lee&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of population health sciences at Virginia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D5P7CKJUPVA4XHRSAD4IX6YS4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like the common cold, measles spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is highly transmissible: According to the CDC, if just one person has the disease, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people nearby will catch it, too.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“Measles is one of the most, if not the most, contagious disease we’ve ever seen,” Lee said.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Symptoms such as a high fever, runny nose, cough, and white spots on the inside of the mouth tend to develop first, followed by a distinctive measles rash with flat red spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FIR7JIF75FCYDID2YGPXIEECZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most people recover after a week or so.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But measles sometimes leads to complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis that can be serious,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;particularly in young children, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Before 1963, when a vaccine was introduced, the disease was responsible for 2.6 million deaths a year, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T4X5NU3XM5G7LL5N6ZGVFFSNGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles was considered eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, when infections had not been continuously spreading for at least 12 months.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;More recently, the number of outbreaks has surged, probably fueled by a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;nationwide decline in childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Most cases this year have occurred in unvaccinated children, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2834892" target="_blank"&gt;recent research letter&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGEMYIVEV5GM3H65JCCXIJ4XBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles outbreaks can be especially alarming for parents of young children and those who are unable to get vaccinated for various reasons.

The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-catch-up.html" target="_blank"&gt;catch-up schedule&lt;/a&gt; for children 18 years and younger that your provider can follow, and doing so “is very, very easy,” Michelow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4O6DHURHUZHEVLNK2G2PFTDK74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Adults who didn’t receive an MMR shot as children&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and don’t have presumed immunity can and should get caught up later in life. For example, people born before 1957 are presumed to be immune because most were naturally exposed to the virus, but if you were born later, you probably need proof of vaccination. “If you happen to be someone who didn’t get vaccinated, or your parents didn’t vaccinate you, it’s not too late,” Lee said.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The CDC recommends one or two doses separated by at least 28 days for adults and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P5KH35IHCFCCXONRDDWKSUF2DU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Everyone should have this protection if they are eligible, but the CDC says it is particularly important for some groups to receive an MMR series if they didn’t in childhood and don’t have immunity.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;This includes health care workers, students, anyone traveling internationally, and women of childbearing age who aren’t currently pregnant. The MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;though it is safe to get if you are breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I26QBAJ3ZFFLJNESWPP7PLZ7LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s the youngest children who have the greatest risk,” Michelow said. “But it doesn’t mean that anybody couldn’t get complications from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JMYVDGABGBCB7MEVS7SODEC5VM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JMYVDGABGBCB7MEVS7SODEC5VM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;2.

But some groups may benefit from an extra or precautionary dose. “If you are concerned — you either don’t know if you’ve been vaccinated or you’re not sure you’ve had the two doses,” maybe you remember only one — “you should talk with your health care provider” about a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;measles booster&lt;/a&gt;, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FF7UVVRAG5FJFP4Y6HMKOTQ2ZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, adults who received only one MMR dose as a child and will be in high-risk settings may get a second shot, the CDC says, including health care workers, international travelers and students. A small group of people vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 were given a “killed” version of the measles vaccine,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which differs from the current, more effective MMR, and should also now receive the live attenuated vaccine, Hamer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECFLU3PO7NBGRHQI3KENVNMP3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not sure if you were ever vaccinated?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;If you can’t find your vaccination records and were born after 1957, blood tests can determine if you have antibodies.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The CDC doesn’t usually recommend this, though.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Instead, your provider may simply suggest another dose, since there is no harm in getting one if you have a healthy immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BGCATO6ABNFWNAZBL2BJGILMBU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BGCATO6ABNFWNAZBL2BJGILMBU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;3. Take extra precautions if you can’t get the vaccine.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGBPGWZ3XBCU3MV6VW4T3NJADI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As we mentioned, the MMR is a live attenuated vaccine, meaning it is powered by a weakened form of the virus. Live vaccines are safe and effective for most people. But this vaccine type isn’t recommended for some, such as pregnant people and those who are immunocompromised or have severe allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXQFX7SQRNGARO26OC3R2W53F4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who can’t get the MMR vaccine for these or other reasons are vulnerable during measles outbreaks. This includes infants, since children usually aren’t eligible for their first MMR dose until they’re 12 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JSKJABD2ZFCKRKZPEDYL5K33YU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Breakthrough infections are rare, but they can happen — and an older person who experiences one may also experience worse outcomes. “Older folks, if they get the disease, are more at risk of complications,” Brull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQENFBFGYZBCHBNJYNUAYUTBOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anyone in this vulnerable group may want to take extra precautions, experts said, such as avoiding high-risk settings like crowds, wearing a mask in places with poor ventilation, distancing yourself from people who are sick and frequently disinfecting objects at home&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(the virus can live on surfaces for up to two hours, according to the World Health Organization, and also lingers in the air).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6EHVCF2A2NFLFN5KZTVTDN6AZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even though children are usually not eligible for the measles vaccine until their first birthday, there are times when it can be given a little sooner. If you live in an area experiencing an active measles outbreak, your pediatrician may suggest that your infant receive an early, extra MMR dose sometime between 6 and 12 months. This early shot “does not count towards the two doses, so those infants that get it at that point will still need to get two doses later,” Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BA7FNTEAGBCTLH5QUJZRHFN7OU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This approach is safe for children. “You’re not giving too much vaccine,” Michelow reassured. The &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Protecting-Your-Baby-from-a-Measles-Outbreak-FAQs.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; notes that the MMR vaccine series is recommended starting at 12 months because that’s when it appears to work best, not because it is dangerous if given earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YGWUFPBWDZANXATUGETZ3Q7QFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another strategy to help protect those who can’t get the MMR vaccine is something some experts refer to as “cocooning”: By making sure everyone who regularly interacts with an at-risk person is vaccinated, you are surrounding them with a protective bubble and reducing their chances of catching the disease. With a newborn, that could mean confirming that all caregivers are either up to date on their MMR series or naturally immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AP6FL3ETCREIVCUPYNRHUMMJ2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This can be absolutely critical, experts said. For example, if you live with infants or someone whose immune system can’t fight off infections, “you could be the only thing standing between them and a fatal case of measles,” Lee said. “It’s really important to get vaccinated — one, to protect yourself, but equally to protect the people around you. You don’t want to be the person who brings measles home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="O2IKRQJFIFB2VAFGOVOPU3TAU4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="O2IKRQJFIFB2VAFGOVOPU3TAU4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;4. Be cautious when traveling.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJDXD6LYLZHCHJBQ7DMZ2EJAXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The MMR vaccine is highly effective, so if you have received two doses, you can safely travel without worrying about measles. For others, the disease &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/02/measles-travel-vaccine-planes/" target="_blank"&gt;can be a risk when traveling&lt;/a&gt;. While frequent measles outbreaks in the U.S. are a relatively recent concern, the virus has continued to circulate in other parts of the world at an endemic level.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“It’s very easy for someone to hop on an airplane and expose a lot of people,” Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FD4A2KLBQBGQNPITDQKQ2CGH6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles spreads easily, so it is possible to catch it in crowded, enclosed spaces like planes, trains, subways and airports, the CDC said in its most recent &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;travel advisory&lt;/a&gt;, which is why the agency recommends everyone be fully vaccinated before traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AI27756TEFBRJNVOGSWTFQTFPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are traveling with an infant, they will have some protection if the mother received the MMR vaccine before pregnancy, Michelow noted. Still, it is worth asking your pediatrician about one of those early, additional doses, experts said. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC recommend that infants 6 to 11 months old receive an MMR dose if they will be traveling internationally or visiting an area of the U.S. experiencing an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="47EQVTQTJFESHEHKHE2SDHDTOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Toddlers and preschoolers who have received just one dose and live in or will be traveling to an outbreak area may also get their second MMR shot a little ahead of schedule, according to the AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EVTVH6FWQFAXPB3JHY47I2TU5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Before you go, it may also help to assess your risk, experts said. Where you are traveling is a consideration to an extent. “If you know you’re going to an area with an outbreak of measles, that’s a very high risk,” Michelow said. But it is still possible to catch the virus in countries with low rates of spread since “measles is really everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LCAZXLGGAFF6VGQGHSMYE4EMUA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LCAZXLGGAFF6VGQGHSMYE4EMUA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;5. Know what to do if you are exposed.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LAQQOZC4ORE4XPE5AGKTEDPZFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frustratingly, early measles symptoms such as a fever, cough and runny nose can resemble more innocuous respiratory infections. “People start to have vague symptoms, but it could be a lot of things,” Lee said. “And the first thing people think about is not measles.” The telltale rash may take up to 18 days after exposure to appear — and all the while, a person is contagious.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“You can be shedding virus before you have a full rash,” Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ULZIWOX7G5AULCA572VHV5FCYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This means that learning you have been exposed to measles before developing your own symptoms can be tricky. But if you don’t have immunity and know you’ve been in contact with someone who was infected — perhaps because a health department notified you — call your doctor and ask about your options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BJIRUB6O7NGINMKCFY7GFBWGD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Again, vaccination is the best protection. Depending on when you were exposed, though, your provider may recommend a post-exposure MMR vaccine or a medication called immunoglobulin. Both can reduce your chances of developing severe illness, and both can also be given to infants, Michelow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IH53EGC7WVGWXLBO7JDZ7IR54E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles depletes levels of vitamin A in the body, so babies who test positive may also be given two vitamin A doses&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to prevent serious complications.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;High levels of this vitamin can be dangerous, so children should be under the care of their doctor when it is being administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U47JKLS4PFDMTNRVX2RG57GDMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/vitamin-a-poisoning-measles-rfk-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin A isn’t a cure-all or a substitute for vaccination&lt;/a&gt;: “There’s a myth that it can prevent measles,” Michelow said, “but there’s no evidence that taking vitamin A in advance of the disease or when you’re exposed changes the risk of getting the infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7UZ7WMKR7ZE7PASGCVMU6JNRHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you know you have been exposed, the CDC recommends avoiding high-risk areas such as child care centers and hospitals.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And, if symptoms do develop, call your doctor and ask about any precautions you may need to take in seeking treatment. (“We don’t want people to show up in a doctor’s office with a waiting room of vulnerable people and cause them to also get measles,” Lee said.) You should also wait four days after your rash clears before resuming your routine to avoid spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IBA6VFF4MRBKVANMJHURPSPT3M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IBA6VFF4MRBKVANMJHURPSPT3M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The bottom line:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SS2GZV5QOZEKDBGFUI5NDK4WLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles is sometimes thought of as a routine childhood illness, experts said. And while it can be mild, this disease can also cause very serious, possibly fatal complications. “We are in a period of history in which most people don’t remember what measles looked like when it was in the general population.” Brull noted. “There’s a reason why scientists developed this vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5lXzZrclBNaVNnTV9JQTJoRk5NYUphWHdENUktaDNIOHdreVQ4SjRUMTF6LWJzMDlTdEUyWVozRTJPUTZsa0ZCeGk4LWU0dkVDYVpqejc2OFQxOHNfTGZ1SUFDOHhldEpaTFI2V3RwN1ozVlZlNDVNYjhVdHQ</guid></item><item><title>亲吻虫子爬进佛罗里达的家中，它们携带着危险的寄生虫- Gizmodo | Kissing Bugs Are Creeping Into Florida Homes—and They're Carrying a Dangerous Parasite - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxOLUhBT3Byd2I2emhxaG9BNUpJRzRhNVl0TXF2LVRlTnZfREF2S0JYcTBJVm9XVXdFNHRxM290cGNZbEtpOFluU0paNGdpMlZJbGgxbjVaNDZMZVVYQXRXUUZXVno0R0dsOFVwR0Jfc3RsSkdlRGV3Mjd5MmZXa0RzRk9OSVZKSTh5WEdxOFluLTVyVUlVTldXczZYOElPN2JHR1JWb051czNZb3lpWjl1M3d5b29TRzQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;People in Florida are having to worry about a unique disease-carrying insect known as the kissing bug. New research shows these bugs are often loaded with a parasite that can cause a chronic, potentially life-threatening infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Florida (UF) and Texas A&amp;amp;M University led the study, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012920"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They collected samples of kissing bugs found inside people’s homes, finding that a third were infected with the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, the cause of Chagas disease. The findings suggest this currently rare infection can make inroads into the southeastern U.S., the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs are formally known as triatomines. Their nickname comes from their feeding habit, which involves sucking blood from the vicinity of people’s mouths. Many kissing bug species can potentially carry &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and spread it to their animal hosts, though only several are known to regularly infest humans. To add insult to injury, the bug typically infects humans by pooping on the bite wounds it leaves behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html"&gt;Chagas disease&lt;/a&gt; can occur in two stages. There’s an acute phase where people may experience flu-like symptoms and a distinct swelling of the eyelid (this usually happens when the bug bite/infection happens near the eye). There can also be a chronic phase of infection. Most people won’t experience illness in either phase, but up to a third of people with chronic Chagas disease will eventually develop serious health problems, such as an enlarged heart and colon, or even heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;About 8 million people worldwide are estimated to be living with Chagas, including 280,000 in the United States. Most of these U.S. cases are thought to have been caught elsewhere, particularly in parts of Central and South America where &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; is endemic. That said, there are at least 11 species of kissing bug that live in the U.S., including a few known to invade human dwellings. Some past research has also found evidence of local Chagas transmission within the U.S. According to the study authors, however, there’s still little we know about its potential risk in Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2013 and 2023, the researchers collected or received over 300 samples of kissing bugs (specifically the species &lt;em&gt;Triatoma sanguisuga&lt;/em&gt;) found across 23 counties in Florida. A third of the samples came from inside people’s homes, and these bugs primarily fed on human blood. 30% of all bugs tested positive for &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, with infections found in 12 counties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings don’t confirm that Florida residents are getting infected with Chagas by their local kissing bugs, the researchers say. That said, they do show that the conditions needed for this infection to spread are certainly there in Florida and other nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This indicates that the environment in the southeastern United States is suitable for [local] transmission of Chagas disease or that the human risk for &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; infection is possible,” the authors wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While more work is needed to understand the exact risk Chagas disease may pose to residents in Florida and elsewhere, plenty can already be done to lower people’s odds of exposure to it. Pesticides can play a part in controlling kissing bug populations, but it’s also important to make our homes less appealing to the bugs in the first place. Much like mosquitos prefer stagnant water, kissing bugs love to make themselves cozy in firewood and lumber. So it’s prudent to store this sort of clutter away from the home, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Don’t keep those woodpiles right next to your house. Don’t keep them right next to where your dog sleeps; I think that’s a huge part of it,” said study senior researcher Samantha Wisely, a professor at the UF College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090451"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As if you needed another reason to hate kissing bugs—they’re also distant cousins of bedbugs, another blood-sucking fiend that’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141117174328.htm"&gt;capable&lt;/a&gt; of spreading Chagas disease as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Left untreated and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14727773/Urgent-warning-blood-sucking-parasite-cases-double.html"&gt;living in the body for decades&lt;/a&gt;, it can lead to heart failure, blood clots and bowel damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on 300 kissing bugs collected in 23 Florida counties, the researchers found more than a third of them were in people's homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in three bugs tested also carried Trypanosoma cruzi and infected people and animals in more than half of the counties examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes the bugs come into homes as more people build property on previously undeveloped land, the insects' natural habitat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, they are urging people in the 29 states where kissing bugs live - including Florida, Texas, New Mexico and Delaware - to reduce their exposure to them, which includes not keeping wood piles inside or near where pets sleep, as the bugs often are found there and can attach to pets and transfer to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Triatomine bugs, nicknamed 'kissing bugs,' carry the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Norman L Beatty, co-first author of the study and infectious disease physician at the University of Florida, said: 'We've done the groundwork to show that we have a vector in our state that is harboring a parasite, invading homes and feeding on humans and our pets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kissing bugs, which range from 0.5 to 1.25 inches long, are blood-feeding insects that tend to hide during the day in dark areas of homes like ceilings and cracks in the walls. They then come out to feed at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study author Dr Samantha Wisely said: '[Triatomine bugs] are ambush predators, right? They wait for you to relax and then suck blood.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They spread Trypanosoma cruzi when humans or animals absorb or accidentally eat the bugs' infected feces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kissing bugs have been detected in 29 states, but Chagas disease is not closely tracked in the US. However, it has earned a reputation as a 'silent killer' because it lives in the body for decades without being detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers in the new study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012920"&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, collected 300 kissing bugs living in or around homes and analyzed their stomach contents to determine the source of their last meal and if they had the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the one in three bugs living inside homes, most had been feeding on humans, whereas those outside homes had fed on other mammals, as well as reptiles and amphibians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections were detected in 12 out of 23 Florida counties included in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said kissing bugs may be invading homes because as Florida's population grows, more land is required for housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wisely said: 'I think that where we have seen transmission occurring in and around homes is in this, what I would call, peri-urban setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, it's not quite suburbs, it's not quite rural … we're building into the Trypanosoma cruzi habitat, and so I think it increases the likelihood of people and companion animals becoming infected.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows states where triatomine bugs have been detected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows which food sources kissing bugs relied on, depending on where they were found. Bugs in homes most often fed on humans, while those outside focused on wild mammals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many people with Chagas disease may be symptom-free, signs include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash and loss of appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once it reaches the chronic phase, patients may suffer heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms, trouble eating and issues passing stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be treated with anti-parasitic medications and therapies for secondary issues like heart rhythm disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wisely said preventing Chagas infection involves keeping bugs from entering the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Don't keep those wood piles right next to your house. Don't keep them right next to where your dog sleeps. I think that's a huge part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the integrated part, not just using pesticides and insecticides. … Habitat management, as well as changing your behavior.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 16:38:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPVlRiTEJ3RGRQRVpsT3J4U0pJYV81WHpPWFVCcFk2anJhNGNvZzEweFMxd01PLUZUUEhJaU5lV1JEczNmdHpsejZLSU8yQUpWUGxIenVsYlRzT09lSXZiaDd1T0RjYWotbEFPWDJHWVBUSzh2RGhuanBkNU91d24yOGxLRE9CZzNyZW1SX09TRTBmNnJIcFFFYzBVUnFTaEY4U2Z0Y2lFN0FlM2NpNHJQQW9B0gG3AUFVX3lxTE9lVmYzZEpBWFpjWGplNjhPWTJkT3Bod0gxR1lVcW1ROTYyazh1MlJ6WWVqa1dWcERLdUwwLUNUMnYyOHFjSFJpSzlzYUJPWHE3T19fWDZIbXpVTERqa09fQnBQbzVSYzdXQlk3bVlGVlNIOTlqYTlTOVhZUFVNWjh5Tk5GVFZIZF9MN3doZnFDN0dkZEg4SjdvUjZiQTF0Y2pfUEthWWRKMEJxWEZvNFJiWTNFYkthWQ</guid></item><item><title>铁含量最高的10种素食-印度时报 | 10 vegetarian foods with the highest amount of Iron - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;10 fibre-rich foods that everyone should...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 foods that help relieve constipation ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>简单的日常习惯可以帮助您降低血压- ScienceAlert | A Simple Daily Habit Could Help Lower Your Blood Pressure - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOT18xdXlUTmRYR01nMEd4NnVzOWF2VjE1MFROYWRReFlFUnFjdUFULTFSVENHU1lpZXVSZWJ0VHBCUGlESU5KSG82T3djU2dxdEJFc09KNkZpSlUxUHVneEJTbnlKUlBxX3NLNkZLak5SZFdEcG15Zkl0MldxZnFMSzB1SXVRd3BTWWVuYWVMbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're constantly told to "eat healthy" – but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They're part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That's flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don't qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even "elevated" blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png" alt="Tea in a cup next to berries and chocolate" class="size-full wp-image-167409" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-415x415.png 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating certain foods could help support your heart health. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-tea-setting-with-strawberries-and-chocolates-31583807/"&gt;İclâl Ağlamaz/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea, one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it's making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="167407" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren't a magic fix. They won't replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike many health fads, this isn't about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It's about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256631/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

While there are lots of foods that may help you live longer, research has shown that &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-blueberries-11690014" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blueberries are especially beneficial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;blueberries are especially beneficial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Of course, longevity is influenced by many factors. Genetics, socioeconomic status and health care access can all impact how long we live. However, food plays a central role in our health, and some foods—like blueberries—are especially powerful. Dietitians say these sweet, juicy berries are loaded with nutrients and plant compounds that may add years to your life. Ready to learn the details? Read on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Blueberries May Add Years to Your Life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Rich in Antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blueberries are particularly &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in protective antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;rich in protective antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; called anthocyanins. “Anthocyanins in blueberries, which give them their beautiful color, have been associated with reduced risk of age-related diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurologic disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.soundbitesnutrition.com/about-lisa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. They are believed to do this by &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fighting inflammation and reducing oxidative stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fighting inflammation and reducing oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve never heard of oxidative stress before, it occurs when there’s an imbalance of cell-damaging free radicals in the body. Over time, this can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Because blueberries are such a significant source of anthocyanins, you don’t have to eat mountains of them to reap their benefits. In fact, one study concluded that eating as little as ⅓ cup of blueberries daily can &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898812/how-food-can-help-you-look-and-feel-more-youthful-heres-what-the-science-says/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce the risk of many life-shortening chronic diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce the risk of many life-shortening chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;May Improve Gut Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gut health isn’t just about smooth digestion. Research is finding that a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;healthy microbiome&lt;/a&gt; may impact nearly every aspect of our health. Enter blueberries. One cup of these powerful fruits provides &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3.5 grams of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;3.5 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt;,  or nearly 13% of the 28-gram Daily Value. “Fiber helps regulate bowel function and plays a role in appetite control and blood sugar management,” says Andrews.  “A recent systematic review of studies suggests that blueberries play a crucial role in &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017087/things-you-should-do-every-day-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:maintaining gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;maintaining gut health&lt;/a&gt;,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to fiber, blueberries are also &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in gut-supporting compounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;rich in gut-supporting compounds&lt;/a&gt; called polyphenols. As encouraging as the positive impact of blueberries on gut health appears to be, research is still evolving, so more studies are needed. In the meantime, adding a cup of blueberries to your cereal, yogurt or smoothie certainly couldn’t hurt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;May Lower Chronic Disease Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Heart disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease are among America’s leading causes of death. Studies have found that blueberries may reduce the risk of developing all of them. For instance, research that examined the link between blueberries and cardiovascular health found that &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962766/are-blueberries-good-for-diabetes-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frequent blueberry eaters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;frequent blueberry eaters&lt;/a&gt; may be less likely to have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or have a heart attack. Encouraging research also suggests that blueberries may help the body use its own insulin more effectively, potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, a smaller body of research has found that blueberries may &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help preserve cognitive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;help preserve cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and possibly protect against Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Tips to Enjoy Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blueberries aren’t just a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7900915/foods-associated-with-living-longer-according-to-research/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:top fruit for longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;top fruit for longevity&lt;/a&gt;. They’re juicy, versatile and delicious. Try these tips to enjoy them every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack on Them: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the best ways to eat fresh blueberries is as a snack. Simply wash and dry them, and you’re good to go. As delicious as they are on their own, they also pair beautifully with nuts or cheese for a satisfying, balanced snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Frozen Blueberries: &lt;/strong&gt;“Fresh or frozen blueberries both offer nutritional benefits,” says Andrews. She’s a big fan of stocking up on frozen berries in the winter months when fresh ones aren’t readily available or are slightly more expensive than when they are in season. Pro tip: When buying frozen blueberries, check out the ingredient list to ensure they don’t contain added sugar or fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Them to Salads: &lt;/strong&gt;Tossing blueberries into a salad is a great way to add sweetness to an otherwise savory dish. Blueberries play well with many types of leafy greens, especially spinach and kale. Other add-ins like pecans, feta and avocado complement their sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix Them into Yogurt or Cereal: &lt;/strong&gt;No need to add sugar or syrup when you can top your favorite yogurt or cereal with fresh blueberries. If fresh berries are unavailable, try warming frozen blueberries in the microwave or on the stove. Then, let them cool and mix them into plain, unsweetened yogurt for a delicious treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend Them into Smoothies: &lt;/strong&gt;Looking for another way to use frozen blueberries? Toss a giant handful into a smoothie. They’ll make your smoothie even richer and thicker. Plus, they’ll provide fiber to slow the absorption of some of the sugars in your smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Fruits That May Improve Longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While regularly eating blueberries may add years to your life, they aren’t the only fruit that can help you live longer. These nutritious fruits also have &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:life-extending benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;life-extending benefits&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oranges: &lt;/strong&gt;These sweet citrus fruits are loaded with vitamin C and potassium, both of which support healthy blood pressure., ,  That, in turn, may help protect against heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apples: &lt;/strong&gt;With roughly 4 grams of fiber per medium apple, apples are a great way to work more roughage into your day.

Like blueberries. These sweet, juicy berries are rich in antioxidants and fiber, which may help improve gut health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Plus, they’re incredibly versatile. Whether you like them as a snack, or toss them in salads, yogurt, cereal or smoothies, there are countless ways to add blueberries to your day. Of course, blueberries aren’t the only fruit that may help you live longer. Cherries, oranges, avocados and apples are all loaded with nutrients that may add years to your life; plus, they’re filling and delicious. Now, that’s what we call a triple win!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-this-fruit-could-add-years-to-your-life-11768483" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNWVhFZWlMZi13RXNYNmRBWFUzRGFELWRfenhwYWNkekZuSllDMU9aa2dzMHhwNVpLQzlDTlB2NnhrQ2M0eHM4Sm9wVk9tMXlNalZHZV9kcWhQYVZsZEx2Vks2NEZaUzRxRTR0UU01RE50Y0NnLXhIQTB4ZzVGcHFJb1R3eFdSbjIzdm9wUw</guid></item><item><title>性激素也可能是心理健康药物-《经济学人》 | Sex hormones could be mental-health drugs too - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNb0RPVGUzeDJQZWlRdnhOdFdpV3htSldlYUQ3US03WUZFZUhFVjkwSng2dFV2cE5fU1lzY1Fna2pRUElzd3M2YmU5QkFuVkYyWF96QU4tNDk1SExsbDd3cXMyVnBtdkVXbjBKUHd0WktibTRCY0JCdkJmbUZ5bWtBdFhfNHpvRFZxbTM2Qnd5WW0wMVVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-5nzj3w ei2yr3n1"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;OOR MENTAL&lt;/small&gt; health is a scourge.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have hijacked the herpes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="167325" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; and turned it into a cancer-busting ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy-by-treatment-types/oncolytic-virus-therapy"&gt;first virus-based cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;, another potentially life-saving treatment is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genetically modified herpes simplex virus, called RP1, has now been shown to destroy advanced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; tumors, even when they exist deep in the body, according to a phase 1/2 &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03767348"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved injecting RP1 into melanoma tumors on or just below the surface of the skin, or deeper in the body like in the lungs or liver. In patients who responded positively to the treatment, even tumors not directly injected with the medicine began to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plant-virus-fights-cancers-in-mice-with-widespread-effectiveness?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Plant Virus Fights Cancers in Mice With 'Widespread Effectiveness' &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result suggests that RP1 is effective in targeting  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="167325" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; throughout the entire body and not just the injected tumor, which expands the potential effectiveness of the drug because some tumors may be more difficult or impossible to reach," &lt;a href="https://news.keckmedicine.org/cancer-fighting-herpes-virus-shown-to-be-an-effective-treatment-for-some-advanced-melanoma/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical oncologist Gino Kim In from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167329" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-642x423.png" alt="Advanced Melanoma" class="size-medium wp-image-167329" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-642x423.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-630x415.png 630w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-768x506.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-1536x1013.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1-600x396.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Stage-4-diagram-2048x1350-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167329" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Melanoma stages.

But after eight cycles, the patients continued with just nivolumab for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among patients who responded well, about 80 to 90 percent of their tumors shrank by more than 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety and efficacy of the herpes-based drug was considered similar for both the surface and deep injection sites. Although a version of the herpes virus is used as a carrier, it does not cause herpes in the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings are very encouraging because melanoma is the fifth most common cancer for adults, and about half of all advanced melanoma cases cannot be managed with currently available immunotherapy treatments," &lt;a href="https://news.keckmedicine.org/cancer-fighting-herpes-virus-shown-to-be-an-effective-treatment-for-some-advanced-melanoma/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; In.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The survival rate of untreatable advanced melanoma is only a few years, so this new therapy offers hope to patients who may have run out of options to fight the cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the FDA has approved just one virus-based cancer therapy – brand name &lt;a href="https://www.imlygic.com/"&gt;Imlygic&lt;/a&gt; – and it can only be &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/talimogene-laherparepvec-injection-route/description/drg-20165223"&gt;applied&lt;/a&gt; to advanced melanoma if the tumor exists on the skin or in the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest engineered version of HSV-1 therapy could get crucial medicine deeper into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug research is being sponsored by a different biotech company, called Replimune Group, Inc., which is investing in oncolytic virus therapy – a clever technique that some think &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-patient-injected-with-experimental-cancer-killing-virus-in-new-clinical-trial"&gt;could change cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="167325" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; evolved to invade our cells. And while this might often be considered a bad thing, researchers investigating oncolytic virus therapy have turned that skill into a blessing. They have designed common viruses, like the herpes simplex virus, to avoid healthy cells and directly destroy cancer cells by causing them to burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon breaking apart, the cell is thought to release a bunch of immune substances, called antigens, that trigger the broader immune system into attack mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167327" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167327" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-642x362.jpg" alt="Engineered Herpes Virus" class="size-medium wp-image-167327" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-642x362.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-736x415.jpg 736w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/fimmu-13-1012806-g001-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167327" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oncolytic virus can selectively infect, replicate, lyse and kill cells.
