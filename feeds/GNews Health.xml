&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing the viral &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/12-3-30-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/12-3-30-workout"&gt;12-3-30 workout&lt;/a&gt; at least once a week for the past year, so when I came across the 6-6-6 walking challenge, the latest walking workout trending on TikTok, I hoped I had found another go-to routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 challenge promises to boost step count, support physical health and build consistency with a simple, structured approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few versions of the challenge circulating, but the one I tried involves 60 minutes of brisk walking every day at 6am or 6pm, bookended by a six-minute warm-up and a six-minute cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking is one of the most underrated forms of exercise. From improving cardiovascular health to supporting stress management, the benefits of this simple and accessible exercises is well documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who aims to hit around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-ve-been-walking-10-000-steps-every-day-for-the-past-year-here-s-why-i-think-it-s-the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-health" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-ve-been-walking-10-000-steps-every-day-for-the-past-year-here-s-why-i-think-it-s-the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-health"&gt;10,000 steps every day&lt;/a&gt;, I was eager to see if this structured approach could boost my step count and set a strong foundation before I start training for a 26-mile charity hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I got on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-of-doing-6-6-6-walking-challenge-for-a-week"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience of doing 6-6-6 walking challenge for a week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Dimensions / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-had-to-make-room-for-it-in-my-schedule-3"&gt;I had to make room for it in my schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, I do three gym sessions a week with a mix of cardio and strength training that takes me around one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dHR4cNAa5uYBy8T3MzUZ4b" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dHR4cNAa5uYBy8T3MzUZ4b slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thought of adding another hour in the gym every day was overwhelming, so to commit to the challenge, I reduced my regular strength training sessions to a quick 15-minute dumbbell workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Monday to Friday, I made a routine of hitting the treadmill in the gym at 6pm. I started with a few squats and lunges, followed by a gentle warm-up walk for six minutes and repeated this again for the cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the main walk, I aimed to get my heart rate up and stay in the cardio zone (according to my Fitbit), so I increased both the incline and the speed on the treadmill and got moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-preferred-the-outdoors-to-the-treadmill-3"&gt;I preferred the outdoors to the treadmill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: SolStock / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie—I found walking on a treadmill for over 60 minutes boring. Music—an upbeat playlist featuring plenty of Beyoncé—kept me going, but by Saturday I’d had enough of staring at the walls of my gym, so I went for a walk outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping the gym for the great outdoors made all the difference, and on the final day I tacked the last of the challenge onto a 15km nature hike, which was the perfect way to finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-set-time-was-a-curse-and-a-blessing-3"&gt;A set time was a curse and a blessing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took serious planning to leave my desk and make it to the gym by 6pm every day. However, it did help me stay consistent and on reflection was a great way to close out the working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A walk at 6pm on the weekends didn’t make sense with my schedule and I’m not an early riser, so on my weekend nature walks I made sure I was out of the door and moving by 9am rather than 6am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="my-step-count-exploded-3"&gt;My step count exploded&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daily step count skyrocketed during the challenge. I exceeded my daily step count target of 10,000 steps, averaging 15,000 a day over the week, and even hitting as high as 24,000 on one of my longer weekend nature walks. This gave me a solid foundation to start my training for the charity hike the following week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that making large jumps in the number of steps you take every day comes with risks. Your body may not be able to cope with the extra stress you place on it, so you should approach this challenge with caution if you don’t exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-won-t-stick-with-it-3"&gt;I won’t stick with it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already active and looking for a challenge to build momentum, the 6-6-6 routine is a great place to start, although it’s unlikely to be suitable for beginners, who should look to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase their step count safely&lt;/a&gt; with small, incremental increases each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, taking on this challenge week in, week out wouldn’t be sustainable for me, either, and would take time away from the other workouts I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I missed my usual gym program, and by day five I was completely done with spending 60-plus minutes on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be sticking to the 30-minute 12-3-30 routine when I’m on the treadmill, and walking outdoors in nature as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in need of a new pair of walking shoes, our guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt; can help.

But if even one or two of these signs are showing up consistently, it’s worth getting your kidneys checked with a simple blood or urine test.&lt;br&gt;Also, women are more prone to urinary tract infections (UTIs), which — if left untreated — can damage the kidneys over time. So it’s especially important to not ignore repeated UTIs or lower back pain.&lt;br&gt;Taking care of your kidneys isn’t complicated — stay hydrated, keep your blood pressure and blood sugar in check, eat clean, and move your body regularly. And above all, trust your gut. If something feels off, follow up on it.&lt;br&gt;Because your kidneys might be quiet workers, but when they’re in trouble, they do speak up — you just have to be willing to listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 03:51:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，胰岛素抵抗的头号蛋白质- EatingWell | The #1 Protein for Insulin Resistance, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9NbnNqcDFkRk9ydm1xY3o4eHNqT0V3b2R0TWxsMnhyNWdHNEx6LUVqU1VTbGZ1Y05WSUFuQ21uYU1aS1RxZ3pkM2NxUUNZVjlFNzF1azY0MTdRNlZNcFBlczBFZVBhRm1OcmRoSzBhNGdBMm9RbGt0T1BkYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

But if you're trying to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and support long-term metabolic health, plant proteins deserve to be right up there with their animal counterparts. According to health experts, tempeh—a fermented soy product—is the #1 protein for insulin resistance, though they note that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; in general are beneficial for improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation and supporting stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein, especially when consumed with fiber, helps regulate hormones that affect blood sugar levels. Levin explains that protein stimulates incretin hormones like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/glp-1-friendly-label-8766055" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, which boosts insulin secretion, helps you feel full and supports proper insulin function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tempeh is made from whole soybeans and undergoes fermentation, which enhances its digestibility and nutrient profile. “Fermented soy foods provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic benefits,” says Dr. Malhotra. Unlike many animal proteins, tempeh also contains fiber and prebiotics that support gut health and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7890254/ways-to-improve-your-gut-health-when-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect against insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporating more plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; into your diet, tempeh is a standout—not just for its health perks, but for how easy it is to use in everyday meals. Levin recommends starting with simple swaps. “Tempeh can be sliced, marinated and baked for sandwiches, or crumbled into chili and tacos,” she says. Steaming it first helps reduce bitterness and allows it to absorb flavor better, she adds. Malhotra also encourages experimenting with different preparation methods to find what you enjoy. “Try marinating tempeh with your favorite seasonings.” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few additional strategies from Malhotra and Levin:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to Grain Bowls&lt;/strong&gt;: Toss roasted tempeh or lentils into a bowl with farro, greens and tahini dressing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Your Sandwich&lt;/strong&gt;: Use baked tempeh or marinated tofu in a TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) or try a vegan banh mi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir Into Stir-Fries&lt;/strong&gt;: Add tofu, tempeh or edamame to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/19377/cooking-methods-styles/stir-fry/vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your favorite veggie stir-fries&lt;/a&gt; for a satisfying protein boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crumble Into Chili or Tacos&lt;/strong&gt;: Try crumbled tempeh or lentils in place of meat in chilis, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/254609/chipotle-chicken-quinoa-burrito-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;burrito bowls&lt;/a&gt; or tacos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Over a Meaty Classic&lt;/strong&gt;: Make a vegetarian version of the viral Marry Me Chicken using tempeh or combine lentils, walnuts and mushrooms for a “meaty” veggie burger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving insulin sensitivity isn’t just about what’s on your plate—your daily habits matter too. In addition to eating more plant-based proteins, these science-backed strategies can help support &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better blood sugar management&lt;/a&gt; and overall metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move More, Especially After Meals&lt;/strong&gt;: Levin recommends regular physical activity, noting that walking after meals can enhance glucose uptake and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060413/exercise-lower-blood-sugar-after-dinner-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a High-Fiber Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Aim for 25–30 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day from whole plant foods like veggies, beans, fruits and whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Quality Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Malhotra lists &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-patterns-and-duration-may-determine-diabetes-risk-8683790" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;—aiming for 7–8 hours—as a key lifestyle strategy to improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods are often loaded with refined carbs, added sugars and unhealthy fats—all of which can worsen insulin resistance. Levin cautions against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; due to their link to inflammation and poor blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While most people think of meat when they think of protein, plant-based proteins—especially tempeh—offer benefits for protecting against insulin resistance that many animal sources can’t. For example, tempeh contains probiotics and fiber, both of which are key for gut and metabolic health. It’s also a lean source of protein and contains potent antioxidants—plus, it’s versatile and easy to prepare. Broaden your view of protein, and you might just discover the plant-powered boost your metabolism needs.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The internet is abuzz with tributes to a liquid chemical called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557593/"&gt;methylene blue&lt;/a&gt; that is being sold as a health supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past five or 10 years, methylene blue has come to be touted online as a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview"&gt;nootropic agent&lt;/a&gt; – a substance that enhances cognitive function. Vendors claim that it amps up brain energy, improves memory, boosts focus and dispels brain fog, among other supposed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health influencers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/methylene-blue-explainer-1.7531116"&gt;podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, have sung its praises. In February 2025, shortly before he was confirmed as health and human services secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-drinking-flight-methylene-blue-b2693495.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared in a video&lt;/a&gt; squirting a blue liquid widely presumed to be methylene blue into a glass – though he never verbally endorsed the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher &lt;a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/pharmacy/faculty-staff/hofseth_lorne.php"&gt;studying inflammation and cancer&lt;/a&gt;, I investigate how dyes affect human health. Claims about methylene blue are alluring, and it's easy to buy into its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But so far, evidence supporting its health benefits is scant, and there are some serious risks to using the substance outside of medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq.jpg" alt="19th century bottle of methylene blue" class="wp-image-163858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq.jpg 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-642x823.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-324x415.jpg 324w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-768x984.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-1198x1536.jpg 1198w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-1598x2048.jpg 1598w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-600x769.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Methylene blue was first synthesized in the 19th century by scientists at the German chemical company BASF.

My work and that of others suggest that many synthetic dyes widely used in foods and medicines can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgae057"&gt;trigger potentially harmful immune system reactions&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike commonly used food dyes – one of which was &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-bans-red-3-dye-from-food-and-drugs-a-scientist-explains-the-artificial-colors-health-risks-and-long-history-247757"&gt;recently banned by the US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; – methylene blue is not derived from petroleum, also known as crude oil. Instead, it comes from a different family of dyes, which isn't thought to have these health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue was first synthesized in 1876 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/med.20177"&gt;as a dye for textiles&lt;/a&gt; and was valued for its intense color and ability to bind well to fabrics. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000443526"&gt;German physician Paul Ehrlich&lt;/a&gt; discovered its ability to stain biological tissues and to kill the parasite that causes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; — making it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.12.012"&gt;one of the first synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt; used in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical didn't gain widespread use as a malaria treatment because it was no more effective than quinine, the standard therapy at the time. But in the 1930s, the dye found a new use in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(73)85407-4"&gt;testing the safety of raw or unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt;. If its blue color faded quickly, the milk was contaminated with bacteria, but if it remained blue, the milk was considered relatively clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This safety test now is largely obsolete. But it works thanks to methylene blue's chemical superpower, which is that its molecules can swap electrons with other molecules, like a tiny battery charger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do doctors use it today?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same chemical superpower enables some of methylene blue's medical uses. Most significantly, doctors use it to treat a rare blood disorder called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24115-methemoglobinemia"&gt;methemoglobinemia&lt;/a&gt;, in which hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, takes on a different form that can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.26340"&gt;Methylene blue restores hemoglobin's function&lt;/a&gt; by transferring an electron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also sometimes use methylene blue to treat the effects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.12940"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/abstract/2001/10000/infusion_of_methylene_blue_in_human_septic_shock_.2.aspx"&gt;septic shock&lt;/a&gt; or toxicities from drugs such as chemotherapy. It is also used as a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/BCR.0b013e3181eed1d6"&gt;surgical dye to highlight specific tissues&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fon-2016-0255"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;, or to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000087871"&gt;identify where tissue is leaky&lt;/a&gt; and therefore may be damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does methylene blue affect the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2015.00179"&gt;Methylene blue can enter the brain&lt;/a&gt; by crossing the protective tissue barrier that surrounds it. Researchers have also found that the chemical can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/med.20177"&gt;protect and support mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, cell structures that are often described as the powerhouses of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.10.007"&gt;may help mitochondria generate energy&lt;/a&gt; for cells to use. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.11.010"&gt;For these reasons&lt;/a&gt;, researchers are studying methylene blue's effect on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, most of what's known about the substance's effects on the brain comes from studies in rats and in cells grown in a lab dish – not in people. For example, researchers have found that methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00430.x"&gt;may improve learning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00130"&gt;boost memory and protect brain cells in rats&lt;/a&gt; with a condition that mimics  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in rodents have also found that methylene blue can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.01133"&gt;protect the brain from damage from brain injury&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies showed that methylene blue is useful in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2017.10.033"&gt;treating ischemic stroke in rats&lt;/a&gt;. However, no research to date has examined whether it protects peoples' brains from traumatic brain injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have investigated the effects of methylene blue in treating aspects of Alzheimer's disease in people, but a 2023 review of these trials notes that their results &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46732"&gt;have been mixed and not conclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small study of 26 people found that a single low dose of the chemical &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9541-6"&gt;boosted memory by about seven percent&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain activity during thinking tasks. Another study by the same researchers found that methylene blue changed how different parts of the brain connected, though it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46732"&gt;didn't improve thinking skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some studies in people have shown hints that methylene blue may be beneficial for some brain-related issues, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02579-8"&gt;pain management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.07.029"&gt;neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such studies to date have been small. This suggests that while there may be patient circumstances where methylene blue is beneficial, researchers have not yet pinned down what those are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is methylene blue safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue is generally safe when used under medical supervision. However, the chemical has some serious risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it can interact with widely used medications. Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03017212"&gt;inhibits a molecule called monoamine oxidase&lt;/a&gt;, whose job is to break down an important brain chemical, serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commonly used &lt;a href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/commonly-prescribed-antidepressants-and-how-they-work"&gt;medications for treating anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt; target serotonin. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06029.x"&gt;Taking the supplement&lt;/a&gt; along with these medicines &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-updated-information-about-drug-interaction-between-methylene-blue"&gt;can cause a condition called serotonin syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to agitation, confusion, high  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, rapid heart rate, muscle stiffness and, in severe cases, seizures or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with a rare &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/FPC.0b013e32836498f4"&gt;genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD&lt;/a&gt;, methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.27324"&gt;can cause a dangerous condition&lt;/a&gt; in which red blood cells break down too quickly. At high doses, the chemical can also &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/methylene-blue-side-effects.html"&gt;raise blood pressure or cause heart problems&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it's considered unsafe for pregnant or breastfeeding women because it may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0223(199601)16:1%3C39::AID-PD789%3E3.0.CO;2-P"&gt;harm the fetus or baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, while scientists have found hints of some fascinating properties of methylene blue, much larger, longer trials are needed to know if it truly works, what the right dose is and how safe it is over time.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257159/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

This is a sign of good health and "may well be promoting colonisation resistance" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health," says Dr Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms," Dr Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Some of them will success, so I do think we will seem them coming through quite soon," said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 23:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAxTllyUVlvWDhyRWE0TVNOd3YzRXkwS1B5ejkwVDdmSmY4czFNdThrclpQdkhvQThiNjZJeGNXT2E0aVg2MTJJMFN0aXhvSDRHRG1zM3JKSXNtZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5FSlM4VjRHaXJhNGlEck5xaVFOS3VLWnB4WnZwVnJZOWJhR0RCLVM0cWNMc1E4T1JtX0h2eS1jSXFGRzBmdy0zOFNlQ2ZkcVk1UnIxSzBnbDFYM1V5NlRN</guid></item><item><title>在“世界首例”手术中进行乳房移植以取代癌症--英国广播公司 | Breast transplanted to replace cancerous one in 'world first' operation - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE04aElNTEhndzBJNTgwN3lKSDNpUEp1STlXWTZwT2FfTjVxWWZXaUFNM3FKY3Fma1ZPUlBRcWxBUTA0OFNCZ1ZIWHRQTzFsUkY4MlZnc3d1dTlOUdIBX0FVX3lxTE53QVp3UTBMU1hiTWNKS1hna21jd1dMUldPY0VfQVBQU2h4VmtjYzdMb0lqU0FORk9QUURtREg5SGpxZWJ2ZklOTERhMlgyejE5VjNhR2JDdVpXSVowNDdZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'My left breast was moved to my right after cancer recurred'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Nicola Purdie Head and shoulders shot of Nicola Purdie standing against a white wall.

But for Nicola this was not a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had already had a double mastectomy, chemotherapy and breast reconstruction after being diagnosed with cancer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But a radical idea which she suggested to her surgeon has led to what is believed to be a pioneering world first procedure - transplanting a healthy reconstructed breast to replace a cancerous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In September 2020, Nicola had just finished with breastfeeding her first child and was returning to work as a geography teacher in her home town of Swansea when she found a lump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By October it was diagnosed as cancer and she started five months of chemotherapy at Singleton Hospital, followed by the double mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nicola, now 38, said: "Even though I only had cancer in the one breast, my maternal aunty and maternal grandmother also had had breast cancer previously. I thought 'I'm young, let's just get rid of everything and do as much as we can'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had reconstructive surgery using skin and tissue from her abdomen in a procedure known as a DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It meant I had natural breasts which would grow and shrink with my bodyweight over time and I wouldn't need implants that would need changing in 10 or 15 years," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because the cancer was oestrogen-fuelled, she was placed on hormone  suppression therapy for at least two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;'This is not a coincidence.

There must have been some cancer cells there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I knew straight away as soon as I found the lump, this is not a coincidence.

Partly it was to shield her daughter from knowing but she had another reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I wanted to protect the baby. I wanted him to come into the world and it to be all about him. I didn't want it to be focusing on 'oh gosh Nicky, you OK?'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She attributes this mindset to helping her "shut the door" on thinking about it until her son was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because of pregnancy, she could not begin chemotherapy, or have the usual scans to establish if the cancer had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had some chest X-rays and an ultrasound of her stomach and liver, which gave a degree of certainty, although not "100%", that it remained contained in the breast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She also had a lumpectomy to remove the lump from the breast skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Nicola Purdie Nicola is sitting in a chair in the special care baby unit.

"He went from strength to strength and that made things easier as well because of what I was dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I don't know how I would have been if he was poorly as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nicola started chemotherapy two weeks after giving birth and would go from the baby unit upstairs to have her treatment and then straight back down to her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had 16 rounds of chemo which took her all the way through to the beginning of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Initially the oncology team had not been sure what operation to suggest as Nicola had multiple cancer sites in the right breast area and a tumour in one lymph node. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most likely option was removal and an LD (latissimus dorsi) flap, which involves swinging a muscle and skin from the back to cover the area left behind by the removed breast, but leaving the area flat in her case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Reconstruction using an implant on the right side instead would not have been possible as so much skin had to be removed, there would not be enough to cover it, or to withstand damage from subsequent radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Nicola's aunt had had the LD flap operation and she knew it came with an arduous recovery process and possibly reduced range of movement - not an option for her as the mother of two small children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She also knew she wanted "symmetry" - either two breasts or none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was while talking to her sisters she initially had the idea that, if she did end up having both breasts removed, why not use the skin from the healthy left breast to cover the larger affected area on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it was only once she was in the consulting room with consultant plastic, reconstructive and breast surgeon Reza Arya, that the idea of moving the whole breast intact dawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt='SBUHB Nicola Purdie, who has medium length blonde hair and is wearing a white t-shirt, stands next to surgeon Reza Arya, who is wearing a blue suit and tie and has short dark hair and glasses.

Around his family, he tried his best to appear strong and avoided discussions of his health. Privately, his severe anxiety over the possibility of a cancer recurrence kept him awake at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors said the man was experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy — also known as broken heart syndrome, as documented in a 2021 case study. The rare stress-induced heart condition has been observed primarily in women, but a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in May found that the illness may be more deadly for the men who get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thought to be caused by extreme emotional or physical events — such as learning about the death of a loved one, winning the lottery or lifting a heavy sofa — takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or TC, occurs when the heart muscle is flooded with stress hormones, causing part of it to “freeze” in place. As the heart struggles to properly pump blood, symptoms resemble those of a heart attack, including chest pain, heart palpitations and irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 patients hospitalized for TC in the United States between 2016 and 2020. While women accounted for 83% of the cases, men were more than twice as likely to die from the condition — with a mortality rate of 11.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The differences between men and women are a very striking finding,” said study coauthor Dr. Mohammad Reza Movahed, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It raises a new, interesting question that should really be studied.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Broken heart syndrome in men vs.women&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar to differences between men’s and women’s cardiovascular health more generally, the discrepancies in TC death rates are not well understood, Movahed said, especially because they counter trends in other heart diseases. It’s widely theorized, however, that differences in hormone levels play a role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stressful situations trigger the adrenal glands to release our fight-or-flight hormones, called catecholamines. They are meant to increase our blood pressure and raise our heart rate, but extreme levels can temporarily “stun” cells in the heart’s tissue, leading to TC, Movahed explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men are thought to produce more catecholamines during stressful situations compared with women, possibly leading men to present with more severe cases of TC, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estrogen, a sex hormone produced at higher levels in women, may also have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, making it easier to manage an extreme influx of catecholamines and reducing the risk of severe complications from TC, said Dr. Louis Vincent, a noninvasive-cardiology research fellow at the University of Miami, who coauthored a similar, multiyear study investigating discrepancies in men and women who had TC. Vincent was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond biological differences, social factors may play a role as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most (physicians) know about takotsubo, but they may think of it as a disease just affecting women, so the diagnosis might be overlooked in men,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital who was not involved in the study. “With misdiagnosis, care is delayed, and that can sometimes lead to worse outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men may also seek care at a later stage of illness, believing that their symptoms are manageable or may pass, said Dr. Alejandro Lemor, an assistant professor of interventional cardiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who was also not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deadly complications from TC include blood clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and heart failure, Lemor said. If the condition is caught early, medications can reduce the risk of having these complications, restore proper heart function and allow for full recovery within weeks, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Higher mortality rates in men need further study&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movahed’s team was able to factor for important variables like age, race, income, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes in the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there was no patient data on other comorbid diseases, such as a history of stroke or the presence of a Covid-19 infection, Vincent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the new study included in-patient diagnostic data only for those hospitalized with TC, so those who received outpatient care or died later from complications outside the hospital were likely not counted in the analysis, Movahed noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To establish a firmer explanation for the differences in mortality rates between men and women and further test treatment methods, a more detailed dataset would be needed, Vincent said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People should be aware in studies like this, we’re presenting findings that are based on diagnostic codes, and we’re not looking at patient procedures or lab results,” Vincent said. “But it’s powerful in the sense that it lets us look at large populations and look at trends. And I think that this trend of a higher mortality in men is worth taking a deeper look into.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Don’t try to ‘tough it out’&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sudden, severe chest pain or shortness of breath should always be treated as a medical emergency, warned Bhatt, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a time to tough it out at home or get on the internet to figure it out. … Don’t try to track down your primary care provider. Call emergency services,” Bhatt said. “Time matters. By winning those few hours, you could save yourself irreparable damage to your heart.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms following physical stressors — a common cause of TC in men — should not be ignored, Movahed said, especially preceding medical events such as asthma attacks, seizures or complications from drug use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while TC is caused by sudden stress, Bhatt said that managing chronic stress with daily meditation or exercise can lead to better cardiovascular health overall while giving you routines to fall back on in unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;br&gt; ™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was afraid of dying from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-bae97520-431d-11f0-b84b-11a11e1504e0"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He remembers seeing sufferers on TV growing up, with their listless expressions and inability to walk. It left him certain he did not want to develop the devastating condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His worst fear was revealed when he used the Death Clock - an &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/ai/index.html" id="mol-6c5e63a0-42e3-11f0-b03f-eb5df1894984"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; that predicts - down to the minute - when and how a person will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson invented the app, which analyzes a person's body metrics and lifestyle, and input his own information. The 43-year-old was shocked when the Death Clock projected his demise at 76 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;possible causes of his death: Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. It made sense, Franson thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his 20s, he had become addicted to anti depressants and sedatives, which left him unable to sleep properly for a decade - a risk factor for neurological decline - and he had a gene that predisposed him to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson was also working late, eating large late-night dinners and balancing his role as husband and father-of-three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to change his fate, however, Franson made major lifestyle changes - becoming what he called a 'sleep athlete.' He fine-tuned his schedule to make time for rest and exercise and to create a better work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One year later, he ran his information through the Death Clock again and it revised its estimate — adding an extra nine years to his life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brent Franson is the CEO of Death Clock, a groundbreaking app that gives users a prediction of the day they are going to die &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most likely cause of death? Alzheimer's was still a possibility, but so were cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something does have to kill you eventually,' Franson told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'My biggest fear in life, it's not death. It's Alzheimer's. Just the thought of having to live with Alzheimer's — so this was really a wake-up call for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the aging population of the US continues to grow, so will the rates of dementia. Currently, an estimated 6.8million Americans have Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - the vast majority of whom are over 65 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2050, this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of sleep - especially a lack of deep sleep - has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's in numerous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say it stops the body from clearing out waste products from the brain — raising the risk of dangerous amyloid beta protein clumps forming that raise someone's risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than one in three adults — 50 to 70million people — regularly do not meet the CDC's recommendation of at least seven hours of sleep every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study has suggested sleeping six or fewer hours per night before age 70 is linked to a 30 percent increased risk of dementia compared to people getting seven hours or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also drive other unhealthy behaviors, like exercising less or eating more sugary treats, which can also raise risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To boost his sleep, and slash his risk of Alzheimer's, Franson began by banning all mobile phones from the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He set a consistent bedtime of 9.30pm, and made sure to have his last meal at 5.30pm every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say a consistent bedtime helps the body's circadian rhythm while eating too close to bedtime means the body is still digesting, disrupting sleep. Some suggest it can take three to four hours for a meal to transit into the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also lowered the bedroom temperature to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). Experts recommend sleeping at temperatures between 60 and 67 degrees to reduce the body's internal temperature and ensure a restful night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had two sets of blackout blinds installed in his bedroom, as well. One that descends horizontally from the ceiling, and another that moves vertically across the window, to block out all light while he sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Death Clock app asks users to describe their lifestyle, including exercise and diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another lifestyle change was cutting out alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has also been linked to sleep disruption, reducing the amount of time spent in REM sleep — a stage for memory consolidation — disrupting the sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society says drinking alcohol also reduces the volume of the brain's white matter, which helps the brain transmit signals between different regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to issues with the way the brain functions. Alcohol can also shrink the parts of the brain involved in memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson also makes sure to exercise during the day, saying he alternates between weight lifting, cardio exercises and yoga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A July 2022 study published in the journal Neurology analyzed the health information of 501,400 people from a British health database over 11 years. Researchers found people who engaged in consistent vigorous activity — sports or working out — had a 35 percent reduced risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even people who reported completing household chores saw a benefit and had a 21 percent lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate October 2022 meta-analysis of 38 international studies found people who engaged in activities like regularly walking, running, dancing, playing sports or swimming had a 17 percent reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is plenty of fancy and expensive health tech, Franson said sleep, diet and exercise are more than 90 percent of the puzzle of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that nine percent was cancer screenings and about one percent was 'all this crazy stuff that people like to talk about.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson added: 'The discussion in the longevity space is often focused on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People devote a lot of time talking about things like Ashwaganda or full-body scans when, compared to sleep, diet and exercise, these are going to make only tiny incremental differences.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/the-worst-airport-you-ve-ever-traveled-through-1851225030/" target="_blank"&gt;Airports are full of people&lt;/a&gt;, and sadly, far too many people still choose to fly even when they're sick, which means you could get sick. It's been that way for a while, but at the very least, you used to be able to count on everyone (or almost everyone) having their vaccinations, so you didn't have to worry about catching some old-timey disease we eliminated a long time ago. &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/nearly-300-quarantined-on-reported-church-of-scientolog-1834461426/" target="_blank"&gt;That's no longer the case&lt;/a&gt;, and it's gotten to the point that &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; is cautioning travelers about the risk of measles in airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, thanks to all the idiots who decided they didn't need modern medicine, measles is back in the U.S., with more than 1,100 cases reported so far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/health/measles-exposures-travelers-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, when a bunch of parents stop getting their kids vaccinated, they get diseases we eliminated in the U.S. decades ago. Who could have guessed? And with plenty of travel still expected this summer, you now have to worry about the spread of a previously eliminated disease that can cause seizures and blindness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events. Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune," the CDC said in an updated travel notice.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CNN, measles was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. There were still 85 cases reported, but those were all caught in other countries and brought back into the U.S. But as more people bought into conspiracy theories, especially in Texas, parents began turning their backs on science, and measles came back. Back in 2019, the worst year for measles on record since 2000, there were 1,274, and we're already on track to more than double that this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, the MMR vaccine still works, so as long as you're up to date on your vaccines, you should be fine. Per updated CDC guidance, every adult should have two doses of the MMR vaccine, but infants between 6 months and 11 months old should get an extra dose if they're traveling. The MMR vaccine is not, however, recommended for those who are pregnant, less than six months old or have weak immune systems. So while those who are vaccinated may have nothing to worry about, babies, the elderly and those who are immunocompromised definitely do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, the co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, also told CNN that parents shouldn't worry about their kids getting an extra dose of the vaccine, saying, "The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know."&lt;/p&gt;

That's just a fact. Vaccines also work and have worked incredibly well for decades, regardless of what Republicans want you to believe. So far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-announces-second-measles-death-unvaccinated-child" target="_blank"&gt;two kids and one adult have already died from the measles&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a good chance we'll see those numbers rise in the coming months as traveling anti-vaxxers spread their old-timey diseases to other travelers. And even those who live could easily end up hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we've brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it's still a lot," Hotez told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. "And we're seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We've had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet that contains a variety of foods is great, as is exercise, but anyone who tells you a healthy lifestyle alone will keep your kids safe from measles is lying to you. Germs don't care about your feelings and will get you sick. Period. So make sure everyone you travel with has their shots. Otherwise, that summer vacation you've been planning could come to a nasty, early end.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re trying to eat a more anti-inflammatory diet to reduce the risk of chronic disease or help manage symptoms of an inflammatory condition, the best place to start may be adding more color to your plate. “An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8007622/vegetables-you-should-be-eating-every-week/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;colorful, nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and inflammation-fighting herbs and spices,” says &lt;a href="https://www.corenutritionhw.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Pace, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.  “This pattern of eating can benefit most anyone, but is especially helpful for those managing health conditions such as autoimmune disorders, heart disease, menopause and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909480/best-foods-for-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data suggests that 85 percent of the United States population is not getting the recommended amount of fruit each day, while 90 percent is falling short on vegetables.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Focusing on more color in your diet will naturally help you eat more fruits and veggies, both of which play a significant role in overall health and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As fiber is fermented by the bacteria in your gut, inflammation-fighting short-chain fatty acids are produced. Butyrate, a particularly beneficial short-chain fatty acid, provides energy to the cells in the gut lining, helping to strengthen its integrity and keeping inflammatory substances from leaking out of the gut into the rest of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you could take a supplement to boost your micronutrient intake, it probably won’t have the same powerful anti-inflammatory effect as getting them from your diet. Research suggests that various compounds found in plants activate and intensify the inflammation-fighting power of various vitamins and minerals. For example, resveratrol, a polyphenol found in cranberries, blueberries, and plums, has anti-inflammatory and antipoxidant effects, and also acts synergistically with vitamins A and C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from adding the rainbow to your plate, here are some other simple and effective ways to get more anti-inflammatory foods into your diet: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use more&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/32764/eight-of-the-worlds-healthiest-spices-herbs-you-should-be-eating/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; herbs and spices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; “Try adding a dash of turmeric to salad dressings, sprinkle cardamom over berries, or mix in parsley and oregano into your favorite dishes. These small additions to your meals can make a significant difference when it comes to fighting inflammation,” says Pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock your freezer&lt;/strong&gt;: Fresh isn’t always best, especially when it comes to keeping nutrients intact. “Frozen foods are often picked at the peak of ripeness and can be very convenient since they're already cut and you can pop them into the microwave to round out the colors on your plate,” says Radloff. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase your colors one by one&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re barely getting one serving of fruits or vegetables per day, don’t overcomplicate it by adding too many at once. “Set a goal to include at least one additional serving of fruits or vegetables in your diet each day,” says Jaeger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get inspired by the Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’d rather have a guideline to follow than just picking up more fruits and vegetables from the grocery store, following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7763980/mediterranean-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;simple Mediterranean meal plan&lt;/a&gt; can help. &lt;/li&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — "More men die with prostate cancer than because of it" has become a common phrase used when discussing prostate cancer. While it can be true for some men, the reality is that regular screenings can save a life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Prostate Cancer Day is June 11. Taking a few minutes to be aware of the symptoms and the screening process can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With former President Joe Biden being diagnosed with prostate cancer, discussion about the topic has seen an increase. Still, receiving regular screenings for prostate cancer has been deemed controversial in the medical world. Due to opposing studies presented by cancer and medical societies, it has become difficult to know if it is truly necessary to get checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to think of patients as a whole person and not consider age as just a number," said Intermountain Health oncologist Dr. David Gill. "A quarter of men in their 70s will make it to 90. … I recommend we consider life expectancy and not just age. For men whose life expectancy is 10 years or greater, I do recommend prostate cancer screening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key symptoms of prostate cancer include changes in urinary problems and increased fatigue. With most prostate cancer appearing after age 50, warning symptoms can often be disregarded as aging. As such, regular screenings are not always at the forefront of an individual's mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Gill has seen firsthand how important screenings can be. A patient currently undergoing treatment discovered recently that he has Lynch Syndrome. The condition drastically increases the chances of developing prostate cancer. Through his regular screening, the patient was able to receive treatment for himself, but also help his family to get screened as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch Syndrome is commonly found in families, and so the discovery made all the difference in receiving treatment for both men and women in the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular screenings are not as invasive as many may think, according to Gill. The physical screening is only necessary for advanced stages. The typical screening is done through a bit of blood work. The blood work provides a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, that indicates the presence and severity of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's cancer rates differ from national trends, largely due to the state's low smoking rates. As a result, Utah has significantly lower incidences of lung cancer. Consequently, prostate cancer is the No. 1 cancer in men throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lung cancer is inflamed by smoking, prostate cancer can be caused by many factors "out of our control," according to Gill. Genetic factors, different syndromes and race can all play a role in prostate cancer. &lt;a href="https://zerocancer.org/black-men" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;African American men have a larger chance of developing prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; and should be screened more frequently. Regular screenings can mean a world of difference for the effectiveness of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest misconception is that prostate cancer is always an indolent disease. It is true that a lot of men with prostate cancer won't need treatment for it. For low-risk, low-grade disease, we can monitor it," Gill explained. "But, it doesn't take away the fact that prostate cancer can be advanced, aggressive and can be terminal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness is key to preventing terminal illness, Gill believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend two things. It is great to gather family history. For prostate cancer, it's not only about men in the family, it's also important to ask women who have had breast or ovarian cancer," Gill said. "Discussing with a primary care provider is important. Guidelines vary, so it's a bit complicated, but a primary care provider can have that discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill recommends beginning screenings at age 50 for most men. Those with high risk factors, such as a family history of prostate cancer, can begin screenings as early as 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

There may be gurus everywhere telling us our real problem is a lack of commitment and effort, but she says that the real path to wellness starts very simply with the smallest of acts that add up to a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A somatic healing and burnout expert said you can retrain your brain in just two-minute increments.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reclaiminghealthy.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa Romano&lt;/a&gt; is an author and expert on mental health and burnout who is certified in somatic healing and other neuroscience-based therapeutic modalities. In a recent video &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reclaimingmelissa" rel="nofollow"&gt;on her TikTok account&lt;/a&gt;, she addressed common misconceptions that make many people feel like actually healing their brains is out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't need to meditate for an hour a day to rewire your brain," she said in her video. "You don't need to carve out an hour a day of anything to rewire your brain." That's because that's not actually how our brains are designed to operate in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-unhappiest-people-retrain-brain-feel-confident-optimistic"&gt;5 Ways Even The Unhappiest People Can Retrain Their Brain To Feel Confident &amp;amp; Optimistic, According To A Neuroplastician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our brains are designed to maintain the status quo. Working with that, not against it, is key.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also "don’t need more willpower," she said. The gurus who insist this don't know what they're talking about, because willpower is quite literally not how brains work. Their literal job is to maintain the status quo to keep you "safe," which our brains define as "not being chased by a tiger" because they formed and evolved tens of thousands of years ago when that was our reality!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mentally-strong-say-goodbye-these-habits"&gt;quitting things cold turkey&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, tends to be impossible for nearly all of us. It's quite literally against what our brains are designed to do. The same is true of trying to, say, meditate an hour a day or whatever advice the guru du jour is giving. Your brain is going to fight you every step of the way. It wants the status quo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also why big, sweeping self-care and mental wellness projects don't work. Romano, by her own admission, is someone who has tried pretty much every healing modality, and has gotten certified in many of them too, including forcing herself to meditate for an hour a day like so many recommend. But that's not what ultimately worked for her either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/superpower-flexes-your-brain-how-use-neuroplasticity"&gt;The science of neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, however, has proven that we do in fact have the power to help our brains shift the status quo it seeks. The key is not willpower or big changes but, in Roman's words, "rhythm, structure, and science-backed tools that work with your nervous system — not against it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/neuroscientist-tips-stop-brain-holding-back-achieving-goals"&gt;Neuroscientist Shares 3 Tips To Stop Your Brain From Holding You Back From Achieving Your Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The healing and burnout expert said all it takes is consistent 2-minute increments of healing practices to retrain your brain.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romano said that for her, what "actually moved the needle required no carving out of large chunks of time" but rather "focusing on my basic needs and then doing a little bit at a time, often." She started with things like drinking enough water and eating enough, then "doing a little bit of time, often" when it came to healing practices like meditation or somatic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was carving out two to five minutes a couple times a day. And this took no major shifts or changes in anything." She just worked a couple of quick bursts into her schedule each day. Sometimes it was just "laying starfish on the floor" or "bouncing and shaking" her body. Other times, it was more structured nervous system regulation practices like grounding techniques. The &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/how-use-54321-method-stop-panic-attacks"&gt;5-4-3-2-1 technique&lt;/a&gt; — naming five things you can see, four you can feel, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste — is one that has worked wonders for me, personally.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/expert-said-consistent-two-minute-intervals-retrain-brain.png" alt="Woman Retraining Brain In 2 Minutes A Day" title="Retrain Your Brain In Less Time Than It Takes To Brush Your Teeth" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Ingrid Santana | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever felt good to me in those two to five minutes at that point in the day" was what she went with. Breathing exercises, somatic movements, dancing, walking in place—whatever gets you out of your head and into your body for two minutes a couple times a day. And Romano explained that over time, this regulates your nervous system to a point that makes it easier to take on bigger self-care projects, like getting better sleep or, yes, meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who actually does meditate for an hour (or sometimes more!) a few times a week, I can confirm that this works. I started with 30 seconds of what felt like utterly useless, incompetent meditation, but over time, my brain adapted. It became willing to shift my "status quo" until 30 seconds became a minute, then five, then 10, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: The wellness influencers and gurus who tell you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-burned-out-person-nothing-left-to-give"&gt;healing from burnout and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; is about big, dramatic self-improvement projects are fundamentally wrong. Most of them are selling you something, even if the product is just their image, and you feeling like a hopeless failure is literally part of the sales pitch. Tune it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, start with bites as small as you need, stick with it, and build from there. Your brain WILL adapt if you ease into it. You'll slowly gain more control over your mental state, and that's when the real healing can begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-specific-hobby-happier-healthier-smarter"&gt;People Who Have This One Specific Hobby Are Happier, Healthier, &amp;amp; Smarter, Says Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Sundholm is a writer, editor, and video personality with 20 years of experience in media and entertainment.

Some people are sensitive [to fermented foods]. Things that inflame the intestine would be most likely to be one of the factors in the development of colon cancer in these people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have found that consuming excessive cheese can ruin good gut bacteria - which can lead to an increased risk for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cheese fermentation is the process of allowing bacteria to turn the natural sugars found in milk (lactose) into lactic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The production of lactic acid lowers the pH of the milk which causes the liquid to form curds - that then becomes the solid part of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Baylor College researchers studied 34 people - nearly all men - who had a scheduled colonoscopy between August 2013 and April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Li Jiao, lead author and associate gastroenterology professor at Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to report their total intake of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt through self-reported questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also collected colon tissue samples from the participants to study their gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The samples and their individual answers were then evaluated using various statistical models and biological tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that consuming excessive cheese was linked to a reduction in the bacteria Bacteroides and Subdoligranulum, which are both crucial for keeping the stomach, colon and immune system healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li Jiao, lead author and associate gastroenterology professor at Baylor College of Medicine, and her team also found that participants who ate more dairy and milk exhibited a higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium - a bacteria known for its anti-inflammatory properties. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although yogurt is often considered beneficial for gut health, the study did not find a link between inflammation and yogurt intake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, she also told the Daily Mail that she prefers tofu as a substitute for dairy and cheese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Personally, I choose tofu and hummus as nutritional substitutes. Tofu is a good source of both protein and calcium.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked about what cheese-lovers can do to prevent colon cancer, Dr Fischer noted: 'The way to prevent cancer I think is having colonoscopies and making sure you're taking probiotics every day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that lactose in milk - which is removed during cheese fermentation - can lead to growth of good bacteria and keep cancer at bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Talking about whether cheese can affect gut bacteria levels, Dr Fischer noted: 'It can. It's very suspicious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jiao told the Daily Mail: 'Our research aligns with previous studies indicating an increased risk of certain diseases with elevated cheese intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Notably, some of the previous research has shown that a higher intake of saturated fat is associated with increased risk of colon cancer and many cheeses are high in saturated fat. Moderation is key when it comes to food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7596189/Cases-pancreatic-colorectal-cancer-soared-10-world-1990.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people as officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies also suggest that cases in people aged between 20 to 24 have risen from 0.7 to 2 per 100,000 people as of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are also expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe that an increasing consumption of microplastics, excessive pollution and high dependence on prescription medication can cause inflammation and lead to cancer development in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marisa Peters, pictured above, was diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer at the age of 33 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However previous studies have also shown that low levels of Bacteroides can lead to &lt;span&gt;colorectal cancer while decreased Subdoligranulum have been linked to metabolism related disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low amounts of Bacteroides can also produce toxins that can induce the transformation of normal cells to cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jiao said: 'Taken together, both Bacteroides and Subdoligranulum are contributors to a healthy and complex gut ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dairy products can change the types and amounts of bacteria living along the lining of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These bacteria are known to play important physiological roles in the body. In addition, different types of dairy products may affect these gut bacteria in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Higher consumption of cheese [reduced] was related to a lower diversity of the gut bacteria in our study.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, evidence of the link between cheese and colon cancer is mixed as other studies suggest that the dairy product can protect the gut from harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Frontiers in Oncology &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.812679/full"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.812679/full"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;found that consuming cheese was 89 percent less likely to cause colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that the high pH balance, low salt and high oxygen in cheese allow for long-term gut bacteria survival - which can help improve digestion and protect the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the Frontiers study noted that Swedish people, who regularly consume cheese for breakfast have low rates of colorectal cancer - indicating that there is a slight relationship between consuming cheese and developing the disease &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 17:16:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxPNkMwSjh3cGtnTVRyQ0J2ZXM5eEZGTEJuY2M4STF1N3hpU2VCWVBsbGNTLVhONi1FQlVUcEljWldTQmZ6d1JtZWpwUDUycGZZa0g0eVluUG1fS3B1RmNpWnFzTjQxQXNrZUp1QWVhX1JySElqS1dxS01fRXZKVFdoV1RUMkEyY0w1ay1ubC1KaXdaZXlIN1N0RVY4aFp4Tm1aelhPc2hHOS1sVFJ4Z1dhUng5NmRZSWxKTENJSVBvbDg0Wmx0Tnd0Sk4zQQ</guid></item><item><title>毕竟，生物黑客喜爱的嗡嗡声抗衰老补充剂实际上可能没有那么有用--《纽约邮报》 | Buzzy anti-aging supplement beloved by biohackers may not actually be that useful after all - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNVWVMZ2pSSkdBUFZJbHp5Q0FndFprQWxLMUZlMW1LQlZob3dwNWdRVWdtb2gxWFBWN3pERjYwUGxSYWpWNjZzZ2Rua1NDRjZzd0lPbTNrZy1rd3V6ek4wcnllQjVreDdZazJWbDNNaUUtSmw3MGp0Z0cwOWQycld1MjFSMFd2anliRExjTTV1RGVrNldkZ3U2RWJ4ZnU1bEVkelE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Biohackers, take note. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that a supplement popular in longevity circles may not be the anti-aging breakthrough it’s been cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings cast doubt on earlier research that hyped it as a potential “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/09/taurine-in-energy-drinks-may-be-an-elixir-of-life-study/"&gt;elixir of life&lt;/a&gt;,” after it appeared to improve health and extend lifespan in worms, mice and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Taurine supplements have become popular among biohackers for their potenetial longevity benefits.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂºÃÂÃÂµÃÂ¹ ÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ·ÃÂ° – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taurine is an amino acid with a wide range of roles, including supporting immune and nervous system health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our bodies naturally produce taurine, a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested its levels decline with age in humans, mice and monkeys. That same research found taurine supplements helped mice live 10-12% longer — roughly the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/health/anti-aging-doc-supplement-can-add-7-to-8-years-to-your-life/"&gt;seven to eight human years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The findings sparked hope that taurine levels could serve as a blood-based biomarker for aging, sparking a wave of interest among biohackers. Longevity figures like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/bryan-johnson-blueprint-longevity-mix-review/"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; quickly added taurine supplements to their routines, chasing longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they might have jumped the gun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biohacker Bryan Johnson is among those who have embraced taurine. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from scientists at the National Institutes of Health measured taurine levels in humans of various ages, plus monkeys and mice. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Contrary to earlier research, they found no steady decline with age — in fact, taurine levels stayed stable or even rose as participants got older.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists suggested that limitations in previous research might explain the conflicting results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most earlier studies were “cross-sectional,” meaning they examined many participants of different ages at a single point in time rather than following the same subjects over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study, meanwhile, combined both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, with the latter involving blood samples collected at multiple time points from the same groups of people and lab animals as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Previous research found that taurine could extend the lifespans of mice.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;filin174 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Notably, the scientists found that taurine levels did vary between participants, but these differences were influenced more by factors like sex and species than by aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists also noted that the effectiveness of taurine supplements for delaying aging or treating age-related conditions likely depends on numerous factors and individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seafood, particularly shellfish, is a rich source of taurine.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;kenwnj – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean taurine doesn’t have any health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The amino acid is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that supports digestion, energy production, immune response, neurological development, brain function, eyesight, nerve and muscle conduction and more.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Although your body produces some taurine naturally, it’s still important to get it from your diet to maintain optimal levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people on a typical &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/05/health/switching-to-a-western-diet-shocks-tanzanian-mens-bodies/"&gt;Western diet&lt;/a&gt; get ample taurine from animal-based foods like seafood, meat, and dairy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegans and vegetarians, however, may have lower levels since taurine isn’t found in most plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those groups and others, supplements can help fill the gap. Taurine is also a common ingredient in energy drinks and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

After sweating it out on the court or on the pitch, you slide into a tub of freezing cold water to keep the muscle cramps away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lately, the practice has gained popularity in wellness and bodybuilding circles — with the additional step of snapping a photo of yourself to signal that you belong to a higher echelon of physical specimen — but influencer gym bros especially. You know the type: selling you branded protein powders, a program for "INSANE" gainz, and form-fitting Gymshark tees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/post_exercise_cooling_lowers_skeletal_muscle.781.aspx" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports and &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;, throws some cold water on the purported benefits of the practice. And hilariously, it seems to produce the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;exact opposite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; effects you'd want as a person trying to build muscle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It looks like it's not a great idea" to soak in freezing water after lifting weights, lead author Milan Betz, a researcher at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/04/cold-plunge-ice-bath-benefits/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wait, you may ask as a person unfamiliar with the practice, why was microdosing hypothermia a thing in the first place? There are purported benefits, backed by limited science. The biggest upside that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ice-baths-are-popular-for-exercise-recovery-and-general-wellness-but-what-does-the-science-say-250649" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research has shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so far&lt;span&gt; is that an icy dip can help with muscle soreness by reducing post-exercise inflammation and flushing out lactates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That makes it more well-suited for aerobic athletes like runners, soccer players, and swimmers. But anyone training for strength? That's a different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of the study, the researchers had a dozen healthy young men perform a leg workout, and when they were finished, immediately submerge one leg in a bucket of warm water (80 degrees Fahrenheit), and another leg in a bucket of icy water (30 degrees), for 20 minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To wrap up, all of them were given a protein shake that contained a biochemical tracer, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;WaPo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, allowing the researchers to see where the protein traveled in the volunteers' bloodstreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of that protein, it seems, may be going to waste. Ultrasound imaging revealed that blood flow in the cold-plunged legs dropped considerably compared to the warm leg — and stayed that way for hours. That constriction, as a result, cut off a lot of protein from reaching the strained leg muscles. Less protein, of course, means fewer gains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brad Schoenfeld, a noted exercise scientist at Lehman College in New York known for his bodybuilding advice, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsc.12074" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; which suggested that ice baths could harm hypertrophy. Responding to this latest research, Schoenfeld told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;WaPo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;that its findings "provide confirmatory evidence" that a reduction of protein uptake is responsible for these negative effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, it's not over for ice baths. This was a small study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and one which only focused on one specific approach. The participants plunged immediately after the workout — but most advice out there recommends waiting several hours. Immersion time could be a major factor, too. There could be psychological benefits, and if your personal experience suggests that to be the case, "there’s no reason to change your mind," Benz told &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, Betz recommends that if you're all about gains, you should pass on taking a plunge right after your workout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on fitness: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/another-bodybuilder-died-oil-injections" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Another Bodybuilder Just Died a Horrible Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 16:45:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTFBuT29SR3h4UTZuTE0tWVpUNHRwN24zT1Mxcm90dE1KTXZGWllCaTh2WTJITEZGdm5YQ25FZll3WU0tVmFETzZCeXVKVDd3ajlVbC1GRmtBMlBDelZ5</guid></item><item><title>登革热的风险只是邮轮很糟糕的另一个原因- Jalopnik | Risk Of Dengue Fever Is Just Another Reason Cruises Suck - Jalopnik</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5UUzk5WjJQSmd6OXc1dFFRdjQzbGNVb29jZnNiQ3FtVlV2Y1owd0x6RTh5bFBQYms0TURDOGVza3RfNWRsZllvRldzS2w1WkJvaFFlLW9pU3dnZnBGLWd5N1NJRmdkNFZyV1dtazZLQ1NBX1d0czRhSUd2VlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-construction-is-like-a-well-choreographed-b-1851761345/" target="_blank"&gt;Watching a cruise ship come together is incredibly cool&lt;/a&gt;, but having to actually go out and cruise on one is &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ships-are-so-boring-they-built-one-that-lets-you-1851596413/" target="_blank"&gt;another story entirely&lt;/a&gt;. Every cruise ship is a small tourist-trap city, packed to the brim with the most entitled and sunburned people you'll ever have the misfortune of meeting. And now, according to the Centers for Disease Control, the cruise experience is only getting better: A number of popular cruise destinations are facing outbreaks of dengue fever. Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is far from the first disease outbreak we've seen around cruise ships — the &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1825413/queen-mary-2-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank"&gt;Queen Mary 2 saw a norovirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt; already this year, after &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-stomach-bug-illnesses-hit-12-year-high-cdc-1851732102/" target="_blank"&gt;2024's record number of shipborne stomach bugs&lt;/a&gt; — but this one is bigger than any one ship. The outbreak is hitting multiple continents, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/travel/cdc-warns-of-deadly-disease-outbreak-in-key-cruise-ports" target="_blank"&gt;according to The Street&lt;/a&gt;, including Mexico, Panama, and Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia — some of the &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/travel/what-are-the-busiest-cruise-ship-ports-2025" target="_blank"&gt;most popular ports for cruises out of the United States to visit&lt;/a&gt;. Cruise ships are packed with people, allowing diseases to spread and fester from bow to stern, and you want to go sail on one? On the boats where they'll &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-stored-dead-body-in-drinks-cooler-for-6-day-1850368004/" target="_blank"&gt;put your corpse in a drink cooler to stop it stinking up the joint&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a mosquito-borne illness, and mosquitos are famously capable of flight. Even if you stay on the ship at an affected port of call, its proximity to the shore could allow infected mosquitoes to make their way aboard and suckle at your sweet, sweet flesh — giving you headaches, fever, rashes, nausea, and vomiting in the process. Y'know where doesn't have dengue fever? Toronto! Go visit that on vacation. The food will almost certainly be better, and you can leave if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all major cruise locales are affected by this outbreak — Alaska, traditionally a popular destination, reportedly remains dengue-free — but there are enough ports besieged by infected mosquitoes that you should maybe reconsider your next cruise. Even if you're not bound for dengue territory, actually, you should probably reconsider. Why did you want to get stuck on a boat with a bunch of obnoxious people and their sticky children anyway? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you age, tuning into your body becomes more important than ever. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that cancer rates steadily increase with age—from fewer than 26 cases per 100,000 individuals under 20, to roughly 350 per 100,000 people aged 45 to 49, to over 1,000 per 100,000 in individuals 60 and over. That’s why incorporating healthy habits into your lifestyle is not a question—it’s an essential.

&lt;p&gt;Daily movement can work wonders for your mind, body, and soul, but ensuring it’s serving its core purpose is critical. That means blending together two key forms of exercise: cardio and strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“By age 40, I recommend adopting structured daily physical activity that integrates both aerobic and resistance-based exercise,” says &lt;b&gt;Christopher R. Cogle, M.D.&lt;/b&gt;, a board-certified oncologist, Board Member at Complement 1, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://hemonc.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/cogle-christopher/" target="_blank"&gt;professor at University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the MD-HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY department. “This could be as simple as 30 minutes of walking most days a week. Epidemiological &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; consistently link regular physical activity to lower incidence of multiple cancers, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, exercise decreases chronic low-grade inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and boosts immune surveillance through improved natural killer (NK) cell activity—all of which are associated with cancer development, Dr. Cogle adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[This stage of life is] when biological aging processes, such as genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunosenescence, begin to accelerate,” Dr. Cogle tells us. “This is also when the cumulative effects of subclinical metabolic dysfunction, environmental exposures, and lifestyle behaviors start to manifest in measurable physiologic decline. Early intervention at this stage can alter the arc of these processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing healthy habits shouldn’t stop at your workout routine. Lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol usage, and sleep should be addressed as well.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These factors modulate key biological pathways that either promote or inhibit carcinogenesis,” Dr. Cogle explains. “For example, diets high in processed foods, added sugars, and saturated fats promote insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Conversely, diets rich in fiber, phytonutrients, and healthy fats (such as those in a plant-forward diet) reduce systemic inflammation and improve gut microbiome diversity, which is linked to immune health and cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cogle specifically recommends consuming a plant-forward diet that’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, antioxidants, and polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you may want to limit alcohol consumption, as it can disrupt hormones and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;increase your risk of certain cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure your bedtime routine is primed for a solid night’s rest, as chronic sleep issues mess with the circadian regulation of cell division and DNA repair, heightening your cancer risk. Ensure your sleep space is cool and dark and you limit blue light usage before hitting the sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A 59-year-old man arrived at the Peking University First Hospital in Beijing for a procedure when he started having severe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/18/us/plane-heart-attack-cardiologist"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Four months earlier, he had cancerous tumors removed from his bladder. Around his family, he tried his best to appear strong and avoided discussions of his health. Privately, his severe anxiety over the possibility of a cancer recurrence kept him awake at night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600033j6ni26df8rp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said the man was experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy — also known as broken heart syndrome, as documented in a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2021/11120/cardiogenic_shock_caused_by_takotsubo_syndrome.37.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;2021 case study&lt;/a&gt;. The rare stress-induced heart condition has been observed primarily in women, but a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in May found that the illness may be more deadly for the men who get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600043j6n43ho2t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thought to be caused by extreme emotional or physical events — such as learning about the death of a loved one, winning the lottery or lifting a heavy sofa — &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;, or TC, occurs when the heart muscle is flooded with stress hormones, causing part of it to “freeze” in place. As the heart struggles to properly pump blood, symptoms resemble those of a heart attack, including chest pain, heart palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600053j6nu8l3ozos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 patients hospitalized for TC in the United States between 2016 and 2020. While women accounted for 83% of the cases, men were more than twice as likely to die from the condition — with a mortality rate of 11.2%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600063j6nhl7fwnni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The differences between men and women are a very striking finding,” said study coauthor Dr. Mohammad Reza Movahed, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It raises a new, interesting question that should really be studied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600073j6nidayie0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar to differences between men’s and women’s cardiovascular health more generally, the discrepancies in TC death rates are not well understood, Movahed said, especially because they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590093519300256#:~:text=Although%20the%20incidence%20of%20CVD%20in%20women%20is,heart%20disease%2C%20stroke%2C%20heart%20failure%20and%20aortic%20diseases." target="_blank"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; trends in other heart diseases. It’s widely theorized, however, that differences in hormone levels play a role.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600083j6niwawtqos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stressful situations trigger the adrenal glands to release our fight-or-flight hormones, called catecholamines. They are meant to increase our blood pressure and raise our heart rate, but extreme levels can temporarily “stun” cells in the heart’s tissue, leading to TC, Movahed explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600093j6nz2euge9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men are thought to produce more catecholamines during stressful situations compared with women, possibly leading men to present with &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.030" target="_blank"&gt;more severe&lt;/a&gt; cases of TC, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000a3j6n73aw8tew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen, a sex hormone produced at higher levels in women, may also have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9330499/" target="_blank"&gt;protective effect&lt;/a&gt; on the cardiovascular system, making it easier to manage an extreme influx of catecholamines and reducing the risk of severe complications from TC, said Dr. Louis Vincent, a noninvasive-cardiology research fellow at the University of Miami, who coauthored a similar&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;multiyear&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711393/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating discrepancies in men and women who had TC. Vincent was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000b3j6n0ku2gtsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond biological differences, social factors may play a role as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000c3j6n6pav4cvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most (physicians) know about takotsubo, but they may think of it as a disease just affecting women, so the diagnosis might be overlooked in men,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital who was not involved in the study. “With misdiagnosis, care is delayed, and that can sometimes lead to worse outcomes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000d3j6ncheptnwl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men may also seek care at a later stage of illness, believing that their symptoms are manageable or may pass, said Dr. Alejandro Lemor, an assistant professor of interventional cardiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who was also not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000e3j6nc811hwkl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deadly complications from TC include blood clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and heart failure, Lemor said. If the condition is caught early, medications can reduce the risk of having these complications, restore proper heart function and allow for full recovery within weeks, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000f3j6nn5w8xmr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Movahed’s team was able to factor for important variables like age, race, income, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes in the findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000g3j6ntzgtrl17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, there was no patient data on other comorbid diseases, such as a history of stroke or the presence of a Covid-19 infection, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000h3j6nbef7s07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the new study included in-patient diagnostic data only for those hospitalized with TC, so those who received outpatient care or died later from complications outside the hospital were likely not counted in the analysis, Movahed noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000i3j6nkvdgaheg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To establish a firmer explanation for the differences in mortality rates between men and women and further test treatment methods, a more detailed dataset would be needed, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “People should be aware in studies like this, we’re presenting findings that are based on diagnostic codes, and we’re not looking at patient procedures or lab results,” Vincent said. “But it’s powerful in the sense that it lets us look at large populations and look at trends. And I think that this trend of a higher mortality in men is worth taking a deeper look into.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Sudden, severe chest pain or shortness of breath should always be treated as a medical emergency, warned Bhatt, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not a time to tough it out at home or get on the internet to figure it out. … Don’t try to track down your primary care provider. Call emergency services,” Bhatt said. “Time matters. By winning those few hours, you could save yourself irreparable damage to your heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Symptoms following physical stressors — a common cause of TC in men — should not be ignored, Movahed said, especially preceding medical events such as asthma attacks, seizures or complications from drug use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And while TC is caused by sudden stress, Bhatt said that managing chronic stress with daily meditation or exercise can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;better cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; overall while giving you routines to fall back on in unexpected situations.

Is this true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie Cannon replies: &lt;/span&gt;There is some evidence that fish oil – which contains omega-3 – can lower the risk of dementia, but there are other, more important, steps that should be taken to avoid the brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is still unclear why dementia – the most common form of which is Alzheimer’s – occurs. And there are no effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there is strong evidence that certain lifestyle changes can drastically reduce the chances of a diagnosis in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, according to the Lancet Commission, a group of dementia researchers who regularly publish a report setting out the steps patients can take to avoid the disease, nearly half of cases are preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is some evidence that fish oil – which contains omega-3 – can lower the risk of dementia, but there are other, more important, steps that should be taken to avoid the brain disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research shows that not smoking, cutting down on excessive &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-3d941ea0-4399-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; consumption, losing weight, regularly exercising and socialising (to promote brain stimulation) can all lower the risk of a diagnosis, as can reducing cholesterol levels and tackling high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If necessary, getting a hearing aid and effective glasses also help to protect patients from dementia, as they prevent the brain from straining itself and people feel more able to socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is growing evidence that a Mediterranean diet also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5686719/Mediterranean-diet-delay-Alzheimers-onset-three-years-study-finds.html"&gt;lowers the chance of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. This involves eating plenty of fruit and vegetables while avoiding processed foods and excessive amounts of red meat. It also includes an ample amount of oily fish, meaning omega-3 – long-linked with improved brain function – is also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it is true that getting omega-3 from a supplement is just as healthy as it is from eating fish. However, the Mediterranean diet and omega-3 are not included in the Lancet Commission’s list of anti-dementia steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are no downsides to taking a daily supplement of the ‘healthy fat’, patients who want to avoid dementia should focus on larger lifestyle changes such as those suggested above by the Lancet Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I recently had radiotherapy for prostate cancer. It has left me with bowel and bladder problems but I feel too embarrassed to see my GP. What would you advise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies: &lt;/span&gt;Unfortunately, bowel and bladder problems are common side-effects of prostate radiotherapy, but there are ways to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The prostate gland – where semen is produced – is close to the bowel and bladder, so radiotherapy can damage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-1510b880-4399-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14789999/Truth-taking-fish-oil-protect-brain-DR-ELLIE.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;My gut was right about juice diet &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I’ve always been sceptical of so-called juice cleanses, where you consume nothing but blended fruit and vegetables, supposedly to flush out toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea, which has long been popular on social media, has always seemed far-fetched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now a study shows that not only are these diets useless, they can actually be harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Italian researchers studied the impact of a three-day juice cleanse on volunteers, and by the end they had higher levels of gut bacteria associated with inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that the juice cleanses disrupted the microbiome – the billions of bacteria in the gut – and may even damage the stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be because fruit and vegetable juices are high in sugar and acid, which can be harmful to the stomach’s lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you ever fallen ill as a result of a juice cleanse? Please use the email address below to let me know. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms are diarrhoea, excessive wind, pain and bleeding in the back passage, as well as urinary and faecal incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For many men, symptoms settle down within a few months of finishing treatment, but for some they can persist longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important that patients who experience these symptoms see a doctor as they may be unrelated to the radiotherapy. For example, bleeding from the rectum can be a sign of an infection or even bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are drugs that GPs can prescribe to control diarrhoea and slow bowel movements. They can also refer patients to a local continence service with nurses who care for people with bowel problems. This might involve suggesting lifestyle changes – for example, eating low-fibre foods such as white rice and potatoes to reduce the urgency of bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also exercises that patients can do to improve their urinary incontinence. If these steps fail, nurses can provide incontinence pads that hide the issue. Bowel problems can feel embarrassing and often lead to social isolation as patients worry about leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;My eye is bleeding and very painful. Painkiller drops don’t seem to help. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies: &lt;/span&gt;Anyone with bleeding from the eye or severe pain there should urgently see a specialist, as their vision may be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most common causes of eye bleeds is a vitreous haemorrhage (blood vessels bursting) but this is not usually painful. Instead, patients experience issues such as floaters – small dark spots in the vision. An optician or ophthalmologist can check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glaucoma (one of the most common causes of sight loss) can trigger eye pain but not usually bleeding. This is when the optic nerve connecting the eye and brain is damaged, leading to sight loss. It usually takes time but acute angle closure glaucoma can take just days, causes severe eye pain and requires urgent medical attention to avoid sight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another issue that causes severe eye pain is optic neuritis – an inflammation of the nerve at the back of the eye that can be an early sign of the progressive autoimmune condition multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is also caused by a virus, such as shingles, and if left untreated can lead to blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-f5d25e60-4398-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14789999/Truth-taking-fish-oil-protect-brain-DR-ELLIE.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Would you recognise signs of a mini-stroke? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing the signs of a mini-stroke is vital, but too few people seem to be aware of what that are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as a transient ischemic attack, it occurs when blood is blocked from reaching the brain, but unlike a full-blown stroke the blockage is only temporary and doesn’t cause permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The symptoms of a mini-stroke include altered speech, limb weakness, dizziness, confusion and severe headaches, and anyone who experiences one must go to hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors of a US study have suggested some put off seeing a doctor – or don’t seek help at all – because the effects are temporary. This is worrying because not only are these patients at greater risk of a full-blown stroke, they also have a raised risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you suffered a mini-stroke?

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14712" target="_blank"&gt;Psychophysiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that experienced meditators were more likely to report feeling a faint touch, even when no touch was delivered — a behavioral shift linked to changes in brain activity before the sensation. These results suggest that mindfulness may lower the brain’s threshold for perceiving stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation often involves focusing attention on internal bodily sensations. Past research has found that such practices can promote emotional regulation and reduce stress, depression, and anxiety. However, the mechanisms behind these benefits remain under debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One proposal is that mindfulness enhances interoception — the ability to detect internal bodily signals — and that this skill may help people manage their emotional and physical experiences. But it’s unclear whether long-term mindfulness practice actually improves objective sensory performance, or simply changes the way people interpret their bodily experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, my co-authors and I have been fascinated by how contemplative practice changes the way the brain perceives and regulates emotions. My own meditation practice has made me curious about the link between bodily attention and emotional tone,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/maik+mylius/694363.html" target="_blank"&gt;Maik Mylius&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Computer Science &amp;amp; Campus Institute Data Science at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Much of the earlier work looked at vision or broad attention; we wanted to zoom in on the tactile domain because touch provides a direct window into body awareness and interoception, both central to many mindfulness traditions and also to emotion regulation. By combining a classic somatosensory signal-detection task with EEG we asked whether expert meditators detect faint tactile stimuli more accurately (i.e., show higher sensory sensitivity) or whether they simply adopt a different decision strategy when judging such stimuli. At the same time, we looked at whether the gating of attention is regulated when expecting the onset of the stimulus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers compared 31 experienced mindfulness meditators to 33 non-meditators who regularly read for at least five hours a week. This reading control group helped rule out general effects of sustained attention or inactivity. Both groups were matched in age, gender, handedness, and other characteristics, and all participants were free of neurological or psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a somatosensory signal detection task in which faint electrical stimuli were delivered to the finger on some trials, while on other trials no stimulation occurred. Sometimes, a brief flash of light accompanied the touch or non-touch, although the light was uninformative. After each trial, participants indicated whether they believed they felt a touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method, researchers measured two aspects of perception: sensitivity (how accurately participants could detect actual touch) and decision criterion (how readily they said “yes” to feeling a touch). Alongside this task, researchers recorded participants’ brain activity using electroencephalography, or EEG, focusing on alpha-band oscillations in the somatosensory cortex just before each trial — brain rhythms known to influence perception and attention. Participants also completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing mindfulness, emotional regulation, and interoceptive sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings contradicted some earlier assumptions. Meditators did not show better sensitivity in detecting the faint touches compared to non-meditators. In other words, they were not more accurate in distinguishing real from illusory stimuli. Instead, they had a lower decision threshold — they were more likely to report feeling something, regardless of whether it was present. This more liberal response style was evident even though both groups received the same intensity of electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected meditators to be more accurate, but accuracy  was unchanged; only the bias moved,” Mylius told PsyPost. “That dissociation suggests the practice alters sensory gating or decision-making rather than raw perceptual acuity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG data revealed that this behavioral difference was tied to distinct patterns in brain activity. Meditators showed significantly lower levels of alpha-band power in the somatosensory cortex just before the stimulus was delivered, both in absolute terms and relative to a pre-trial baseline. Trial-by-trial analysis confirmed that lower prestimulus alpha activity predicted a higher likelihood of reporting a touch, regardless of whether one occurred. This pattern supports the idea that reduced alpha activity reflects a more “open” or excitable state in the sensory cortex, making it more likely that ambiguous internal sensations will be interpreted as external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while this shift in brain state increased report rates, it did not enhance sensory precision. There was no evidence that lower alpha power improved sensitivity — the ability to correctly identify real touches. Instead, it appears to have increased both hits and false alarms, leading to more overall reports without better discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these perceptual changes, meditators also reported significantly higher interoceptive sensibility across most domains on the MAIA-2 questionnaire, including greater awareness of internal sensations, better attention regulation, and less tendency to ignore or worry about uncomfortable bodily feelings. They also reported lower levels of expressive suppression (an emotion regulation strategy that involves hiding one’s feelings) and less difficulty describing emotions. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that mindfulness practice is associated with greater emotional and bodily awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term meditation practice doesn’t necessarily make your senses sharper in this kind of lab test,” Mylius explained. “It seems to shift the decision threshold – or criterio n- you use when deciding ‘Did I just feel something?’ Expert meditators were more willing to say ‘yes’ to near-threshold tactile events, and this more liberal bias was preceded by lower prestimulus alpha power—an EEG signature of reduced sensory gating. In plain language: mindfulness may teach the brain to keep the gate a bit more open, letting weak bodily signals reach awareness that non-meditators might ignore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any study, there are caveats to consider. Because it used a cross-sectional design, the study cannot determine whether mindfulness practice caused the observed differences or whether people with certain perceptual traits are more drawn to meditation. The reading control group may also differ from the meditators in lifestyle factors not captured by the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also caution that although EEG alpha suppression is often interpreted as increased attentional readiness, it may also reflect reduced top-down filtering — a shift toward more bottom-up processing of sensory input. From a predictive processing perspective, this might mean that meditators rely less on prior expectations and more on incoming sensory data, potentially leading to a more present-centered experience of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our design was cross-sectional, so we can’t prove meditation caused the bias shift—highly body-aware people might simply be drawn to intensive practice,” Mylius said. “The sample (31 experts, 33 controls) was relatively small, EEG scalp recordings limit spatial precision, and our ‘experts’ came from several traditions. Future longitudinal work with larger groups, within-tradition sampling, and source-localized neural measures is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14712" target="_blank"&gt;Meditation expertise influences response bias and prestimulus alpha activity in the somatosensory signal detection task&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Maik Mylius, Simon Guendelman, Fivos Iliopoulos, Vittorio Gallese, and Laura Kaltwasser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 14:06:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOVTNtOHlfOWdiS3M1RS1mejNreHB5UXF1TGowUUFVRS1UUk5wTUJfSGFyZEVEOUlGRTJDOERUQUpIb1NJeEtIMHdmT3V2cmlwT08tS3p5Yl9LcjRWMDJYdjNWZlgwaHNiRDl6SWdiSWxQa0R2TU1hUzVjQWdCY05mQm1nS0V5dHB5RXpPbTltSC1vVTZkOFNONkc2TmZZUQ</guid></item><item><title>今年秋天谁可以接种新冠疫苗？以下是我们所知道的- OregonLive.com | Who can get a COVID-19 vaccine this fall?

She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What’s considered increased risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KZDULRSOBFF7XDEC2D7M2WZWYE"&gt;The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity.

Whether it’s the weather, work stress, or simply a bad night’s sleep, our moods can dip without warning. But here’s the good news: what you eat has a direct connection to how you feel. Yes, your plate could be your personal happiness toolkit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before we get into the delicious details, let’s quickly break down the science behind those “feel-good” vibes. There are a few key players in the world of mood regulation: Serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins also known as “happy hormones”. Serotonin stabilises mood, sleep, and appetite; dopamine drives motivation and pleasure; and endorphins relieve stress and boost joy, often released through laughter, exercise, or food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what if your next bite could actually give your brain a gentle lift? It can. These seven foods are packed with nutrients that naturally support the production and balance of these happy hormones. Ready to eat your way to a better mood? Let’s dig in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 12:45:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxNSGxJWUFNbDNiU0FYaGdMdVhnUlZSQm1yRUo0U21TWDhidUNlemw1eUR1RWhadS1VekxmTHNzbXNOY1J5RGphMV9jbDdYMVk0aERwZTVoUmtsOWQyc2VPNnp1RS1SdkJvTEQ0M0FISVFKM29rdnpiOHdMUjRaWWQ0MW9EbG56cC1tTkl6MG5CRldnRlJjRmRtdUJUdmNkZXNtOVpEbmN4UUYwTVhUSVdQMXlfUjhhRmdUSUtyRGRzaXMtTVR0VVhIcXQ3RzFHX0FPV2xKQ3czajMtNGxpdERQVU1wRmtKX0Exam11NNIB9AFBVV95cUxPZlZxNnl4VG52b2p2eWNibVBHMXB1bzF3Y1ZRN25haXA5OWU4M1FYRUVzTWRoQnRqWUs3R0FOWUt1Z1RweFU2SUkwNWVPaUp5S25LWlhVRmxPdTRqN0tvTjgzU1NKRkg0OFQ1REJ6c05UbFdDV0lCZnpITURYb3JpdzNwNGUyYmVXaUxOaTRfNlBPOW8yUG01c0RWdlNpdWM5aTFRNWNIX2lPTUJSMkR6TFM1UzZaYkN4R2VqampzLU5MaUNWRHhZS2pJY2xTX19ZZUkxTmkwSW0xVFVhVnpIYVVqaHUtSFE3X3VhRTBpUTc2TEhB</guid></item><item><title>我们正在秘密赢得癌症战争- vox.com | We’re secretly winning the war on cancer - vox.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPX3JjUG0yME8xN0VybHROMU9Ob2hZX2JqSWtTdmkwZ090c09ISnhHd1RvSkl4Vk5JX3VJdm5aMUhaV09EaDFtNXVNS2NJX0JvckRqcHlCYVJIbURFaDhTS3BiNkR4LUpZVlVRSVFlcmdxLWsyNU94RnJQc0wwMjJucmVQdG5CRXliaWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On November 4, 2003, a doctor gave Jon Gluck some of the worst news imaginable: He had cancer — one that later tests would reveal as &lt;a href="https://themmrf.org/multiple-myeloma/"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;, a severe blood and bone marrow cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Jon was &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/cancer-survival-multiple-myeloma-jon-gluck-exercise-in-uncertainty.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; he might have as little as 18 months to live. He was 38, a thriving magazine editor in New York with a 7-month-old daughter whose third birthday, he suddenly realized, he might never see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The moment after I was told I had cancer, I just said ‘no, no, no,’” Jon told me in an interview just last week. “This cannot be true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The fact that Jon is still here, talking to me in 2025, tells you that things didn’t go the way the medical data would have predicted on that November morning. He has lived with his cancer, through waves of remission and recurrence, for more than 20 years, an experience he chronicles with grace and wit in his new book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/760582/an-exercise-in-uncertainty-by-jonathan-gluck/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Exercise in Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That 7-month-old daughter is now in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You could say Jon has beaten the odds, and he’s well aware that chance played some role in his survival. (“Did you know that ‘Glück’ is German for ‘luck’?” he writes in the book, noting his good fortune that a random spill on the ice is what sent him to the doctor in the first place, enabling them to catch his cancer early.) Cancer is still a terrible health threat, one that is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/news-events/new-report-on-global-cancer-burden-in-2022-by-world-region-and-human-development-level/"&gt;1 in 6 deaths&lt;/a&gt; around the world, killing nearly 10 million people a year globally and over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/index.html"&gt;600,000 people a year in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Jon’s story and his survival demonstrate something that is too often missed: We’ve turned the tide in the war against cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The age-adjusted death rate in the US for cancer has &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/u-s-cancer-death-rate-has-fallen-33-since-1991-heres-why"&gt;declined by about a third since 1991&lt;/a&gt;, meaning people of a given age have about a third lower risk of dying from cancer than people of the same age more than three decades ago. That adds up to &lt;a href="https://ascopost.com/issues/february-25-2024/american-cancer-society-annual-report-shows-cancer-mortality-still-declining-but-cancer-incidence-is-projected-to-top-2-million/"&gt;over 4 million&lt;/a&gt; fewer cancer deaths over that time period. Thanks to breakthroughs in treatments like &lt;a href="https://people.com/jonathan-gluck-living-with-cancer-22-years-science-saved-him-memoir-exclusive-11747490"&gt;autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy&lt;/a&gt; — breakthroughs Jon himself benefited from, often just in time — cancer isn’t the death sentence it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="getting-better-all-the-time" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Getting better all the time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s no doubt that just as the rise of smoking in the 20th century led to a major increase in cancer deaths, the equally sharp decline of tobacco use eventually led to a delayed decrease. Smoking is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530575/"&gt;one of the most potent carcinogens&lt;/a&gt; in the world, and at the peak in the early 1960s, around 12 cigarettes were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a2.htm"&gt;being sold per adult &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Take away the cigarettes and — after a delay of a couple of decades — lung cancer deaths drop in turn along with other &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294316/#:~:text=As%20discussed%20in%20Chapter%2013,likely%20approaching%20500%2C000%20per%20year."&gt;non-cancer smoking-related deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as Saloni Dattani &lt;a href="https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/the-decline-in-cancer-mortality-is"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a great piece earlier this year, even before the decline of smoking, death rates from non-lung cancers in the stomach and colon had begun to fall. Just as notably, death rates for childhood cancers — which for obvious reasons are not connected to smoking and tend to be caused by genetic mutations — have fallen significantly as well, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/childhood-cancer-deaths-in-the-united-states-have-declined-six-fold-over-the-last-seventy-years"&gt;declining sixfold since 1950&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1960s, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1400972"&gt;only around 10 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survived more than five years. Today it’s more than 90 percent. And the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2024-cancer-facts-figures.html"&gt;five-year survival rate for all cancers&lt;/a&gt; has risen from 49 percent in the mid-1970s to 69 percent in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’ve made strikes against the toughest of cancers, like Jon’s multiple myeloma. Around when Jon was diagnosed, the &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html"&gt;five-year survival rate was just 34 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Today it’s as high as 62 percent, and more and more people like Jon are living for decades. “There has been a revolution in cancer survival,” Jon told me. “Some illnesses now have far more successful therapies than others, but the gains are real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The dramatic bend in the curve of cancer deaths didn’t happen by accident — it’s the compound interest of three revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While anti-smoking policy has been the single biggest lifesaver, other interventions have helped reduce people’s cancer risk. One of the biggest successes is the HPV vaccine. A &lt;a href="https://web.musc.edu/about/news-center/2024/11/27/cervical-cancer-deaths-in-young-women-plummet-after-introduction-of-hpv-vaccine"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; found that death rates of cervical cancer — which can be caused by HPV infections — in US women ages 20–39 had dropped 62 percent from 2012 to 2021, thanks largely to the spread of the vaccine. Other cancers have been linked to infections, and there is strong research indicating that vaccination can &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001774"&gt;have positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on reducing cancer incidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The next revolution is better and earlier screening. It’s generally true that the earlier cancer is caught, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35298272/"&gt;better the chances of survival&lt;/a&gt;, as Jon’s own story shows. According to one study, incidences of late-stage colorectal cancer in Americans over 50 &lt;a href="https://time.com/27261/colon-cancer-rates-have-plummeted-over-the-last-decade/"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; by a third between 2000 and 2010 in large part because rates of colonoscopies almost tripled in that same time period. And newer screening methods, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500%2824%2900267-X/fulltext"&gt;often employing AI&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/patient-reported-outcomes-for-grails-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-published-in-lancet-oncology/"&gt;blood-based tests&lt;/a&gt;, could make preliminary screening simpler, less invasive and therefore more readily available. If 20th-century screening was about finding physical evidence of something wrong — the lump in the breast — 21st-century screening aims to find cancer before symptoms even arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most exciting of all are frontier developments in treating cancer, much of which can be tracked through Jon’s own experience. From drugs like lenalidomide and bortezomib in the 2000s, which &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html"&gt;helped double median myeloma survival&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/darzalex-daratumumab-approved-by-us-fda-first-human-anti-cd38-monoclonal-antibody-available-for-the-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma"&gt;spread of monoclonal antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, real breakthroughs in treatments have meaningfully extended people’s lives — not just by months, but years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Perhaps the most promising development is CAR-T therapy, a form of immunotherapy. Rather than attempting to kill the cancer directly, immunotherapies turn a patient’s own T-cells into guided missiles. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/health/multiple-myeloma-car-t-immunotherapy.html"&gt;recent study of 97 patients with multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom were facing hospice care, a third of those who received CAR-T therapy had no detectable cancer five years later. It was the kind of result that doctors rarely see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“CAR-T is mind-blowing — very science-fiction futuristic,” Jon told me. He underwent his own course of treatment with it in mid-2023 and writes that the experience, which put his cancer into a remission he’s still in, left him feeling “physically and metaphysically new.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While there are still more battles to be won in the war on cancer, and there are certain areas — like the &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people&lt;/a&gt; — where the story isn’t getting better, the future of cancer treatment is improving. For cancer patients like Jon, that can mean a new challenge — enduring the essential uncertainty that comes with living under a disease that’s controllable but which could always come back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it sure beats the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I’ve come to trust so completely in my doctors and in these new developments,” he said. “I try to remain cautiously optimistic that my future will be much like the last 20 years.” And that’s more than he or anyone else could have hoped for nearly 22 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPX3JjUG0yME8xN0VybHROMU9Ob2hZX2JqSWtTdmkwZ090c09ISnhHd1RvSkl4Vk5JX3VJdm5aMUhaV09EaDFtNXVNS2NJX0JvckRqcHlCYVJIbURFaDhTS3BiNkR4LUpZVlVRSVFlcmdxLWsyNU94RnJQc0wwMjJucmVQdG5CRXliaWc</guid></item><item><title>迷幻药可能会缓解创伤后应激障碍，发现新星音乐节大屠杀幸存者的新研究- PsyPost | Psychedelics may buffer against PTSD, finds new study of survivors of Nova music festival massacre - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxORWx4TmpkTTN5RWFndU0yRHFFVGdBdWpSc3VtZFRCSmJXQWIxbTE5MlIwNjFCMlowck1VRXE3RUZqUjRYQUJ3V2puQ19jOW8za01RTTRWZE12eHd0RXNndU9MRC1kX2NqQ3J6b0hmTG9oSXh1Z25PbzBCTHdiMVo1TkRFMzZyYlJRbTRpR0p5eTkzNEotcnJqNGpGbTIwekk1RzZtSm9fUlYzMHRCYWdBTE9hT2pKU3NwMXlua3BQOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251334025" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that people who had consumed classic psychedelics before experiencing an extreme traumatic event reported lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms in the following weeks. The research, conducted among survivors of the October 7, 2023 terrorist attack at the Nova music festival in Israel, provides rare real-world data on how psychedelics might affect the way trauma is encoded in memory. The findings add to a growing body of research on the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances for trauma-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health condition that can occur after someone experiences or witnesses a terrifying event. People with PTSD may struggle with intrusive memories, emotional numbness, anxiety, and avoidance of reminders of the trauma. While some people recover naturally, others experience symptoms that persist for months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 7, 2023, during the early morning hours, militants from Hamas launched a large-scale, coordinated attack on Israel. One of their first targets was the Supernova Sukkot Gathering, a psychedelic trance music festival attended by approximately 3,500 people near the Gaza border. The attack began with a barrage of rockets, followed by an onslaught of armed militants who infiltrated the festival grounds. The massacre resulted in the deaths of 378 individuals, including civilians, security personnel, and the festival’s organizers. Many were shot at close range or killed while hiding. Dozens of attendees were abducted and taken into Gaza, and there were widespread reports of sexual and physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some survivors were under the influence of mind-altering substances at the time of the attack, including psychedelic drugs commonly used in recreational settings such as psilocybin (“magic” mushrooms) or LSD. The chaos and horror of the attack, combined with altered mental states, created an unprecedented context in which to study how such substances might shape the formation of traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My longstanding research in trauma, resilience, and mental health led us to explore the intersection between extreme events and altered states of consciousness,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/Zohar-Rubinstein/" target="_blank"&gt;Zohar Rubinstein&lt;/a&gt; of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The tragic attack at the Nova music festival presented a unique and heartbreaking opportunity to examine, in real-world conditions, how the peri-traumatic use of psychedelics might affect the development of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms. There was very limited empirical data on human psychedelic use during acute trauma, and we felt an urgent need to document and understand these effects to inform both science and clinical practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers began collecting data from October 22 to October 28, 2023—roughly three weeks after the attack, during the acute phase of trauma response. They approached survivors who were staying at a temporary “healing space” designed to provide psychological support. A total of 343 adults (189 women and 154 men) agreed to participate, with ages ranging from 18 to 64. Participants completed anonymous surveys asking about their drug use before and during the festival, as well as their current psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked participants whether they had consumed any of 18 mind-altering substances, including classic psychedelics such as mushrooms, LSD, and mescaline, as well as MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy). Participants also completed two standardized questionnaires: one measuring symptoms of anxiety and another measuring symptoms of acute stress disorder, a condition that can develop shortly after trauma and is often a precursor to PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into three groups: those who consumed classic psychedelics, those who consumed MDMA, and those who had not consumed any psychedelic substances. The researchers also accounted for whether people had consumed additional recreational substances like alcohol or cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that survivors who were under the influence of classic psychedelics at the time of the attack reported significantly lower levels of anxiety three weeks later, compared to those who had taken MDMA or no psychedelics at all. The average anxiety rating in the classic psychedelic group corresponded to symptoms being present “several days” over the past two weeks, while the other groups reported symptoms occurring “more than half the days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect remained even after accounting for participants’ gender, age, past psychiatric diagnoses, and whether they had used psychedelics in the previous year. In contrast, there was no significant difference in anxiety levels between the MDMA group and the group that had not consumed psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to post-traumatic symptoms, the picture was more nuanced. Overall, the groups did not differ significantly. But when the researchers looked only at people who had not consumed additional substances like alcohol or cannabis, they found that those in the classic psychedelics group again reported lower levels of trauma symptoms. This protective effect was not observed in the MDMA or no-psychedelic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that classic psychedelics may have a unique influence on how traumatic memories are encoded in the brain. Specifically, they appear to blunt the emotional intensity or durability of the trauma memory when consumed just before or during the event. However, this effect seems to be weakened or lost when the psychedelics are taken alongside other substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Survivors who consumed classic psychedelics—such as psilocybin, LSD, mescaline, or 2C-B—reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms three weeks after the attack, compared to those who did not use psychedelics or who used other substances like MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol,” Rubinstein told PsyPost. “This effect remained strong even after controlling for age, gender, psychiatric history, and previous psychedelic use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by the magnitude and consistency of the effect: classic psychedelics, but not MDMA, were associated with reduced anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms, especially among those who did not consume additional substances like alcohol or cannabis. We expected some protective effect based on prior animal studies, but seeing it so clearly in a real-life mass trauma was unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these results do not mean psychedelics are a recommended or safe treatment for trauma outside controlled settings,” Rubinstein noted. “Psychedelic use still carries psychological and legal risks and should not be undertaken without proper supervision and research guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why might classic psychedelics be protective? One possible explanation relates to how different substances affect the brain. Classic psychedelics act strongly on serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor, which plays a role in memory consolidation and emotional processing. By altering the way sensory and emotional information is processed during trauma, these substances may reduce the severity of later psychological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, MDMA has a different pharmacological profile, affecting not only serotonin but also dopamine and norepinephrine. While MDMA is known for its prosocial and euphoric effects, it may not engage the same neural systems involved in memory encoding in the same way that classic psychedelics do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also considered that the use of other substances like cannabis or alcohol may interfere with the potential benefits of psychedelics. These substances can impair memory and emotional regulation, possibly counteracting the protective effects of psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the compelling findings, the authors acknowledge several limitations. First, the study relied entirely on self-report data, and there were no objective measures of psychological symptoms or drug concentrations. The specific doses and purity of the substances consumed were also unknown, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the pharmacological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results do not establish causality; they only indicate a strong association in these particular circumstances,” Rubinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, since psychedelics are illegal in Israel, participants may have underreported their use, potentially skewing the results. There may also have been selection bias, as individuals who had more traumatic or negative experiences might have chosen not to participate in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, the study only looked at symptoms three weeks after the trauma. It remains unknown whether the effects observed here will persist or whether new symptoms might emerge over time. Longer follow-up periods are needed to understand how psychedelic use affects the development or prevention of PTSD in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the findings suggest a possible protective effect of psychedelics on trauma-related symptoms, the researchers caution against interpreting this as an endorsement for unsupervised use. Psychedelics can produce intense and sometimes destabilizing experiences, especially in uncontrolled settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most overlooked aspects in discussions of psychedelics for trauma is the importance of ‘set and setting,'” Rubinstein explained. “Safe and effective therapeutic use of psychedelics generally requires a carefully controlled environment, guided by trained professionals or, in some traditions, shamans. Our findings are based on substances consumed in the unpredictable and often unsafe environment of a music festival during a traumatic event, not in a therapeutic context. This means that no clinical recommendations or therapeutic conclusions should be drawn from experiences that occurred in such uncontrolled, non-clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope that future research will build on these findings to better understand the brain mechanisms that underlie trauma and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to understand better how psychedelics may affect trauma memory formation and resilience,” Rubinstein said. “We hope to inform future controlled studies that could clarify mechanisms and potentially lead to safe, evidence-based interventions for trauma and anxiety. Ultimately, we want to bridge the gap between neuroscience, clinical psychology, and real-world emergency contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study offers a rare glimpse into the real-world intersection of trauma and psychedelics, outside the lab, in the midst of a national tragedy. I am deeply grateful to the survivors who were willing to share their experiences, and I stress that this research should not be interpreted as an endorsement for unsupervised psychedelic use. More research, careful dialogue, and clinical caution are necessary as this field continues to evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251334025" target="_blank"&gt;Peri-traumatic consumption of classic psychedelics is associated with lower anxiety and post-traumatic responses 3 weeks after exposure&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Einat Karp Barnir, Zohar Rubinstein , Rany Abend, Shaul Lev-Ran, Lia Naor, and Mario Mikulincer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 12:13:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxORWx4TmpkTTN5RWFndU0yRHFFVGdBdWpSc3VtZFRCSmJXQWIxbTE5MlIwNjFCMlowck1VRXE3RUZqUjRYQUJ3V2puQ19jOW8za01RTTRWZE12eHd0RXNndU9MRC1kX2NqQ3J6b0hmTG9oSXh1Z25PbzBCTHdiMVo1TkRFMzZyYlJRbTRpR0p5eTkzNEotcnJqNGpGbTIwekk1RzZtSm9fUlYzMHRCYWdBTE9hT2pKU3NwMXlua3BQOA</guid></item><item><title>鲜为人知的细胞可能是人类大脑庞大记忆的关键--《华盛顿邮报》 | Little-known cells might be key to human brain’s massive memory - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa0hWbkRfNFlKVzh6ejZoUktIendQTklabTdseEltZzNDN3p3ck1DUG1iaS1QYkdwaEY5REVCby1VUENIdnVSYlktRFc4M1NFbFNGQ0gtSkVoWHpNdndVbUNjMU1PWElXNGtvSVhqNnJmRGNWcWNydUdHdklHWG9hU0JWNmQtNkd4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMRHQZ7DXRG4TP6FJRSUIY7ME4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A new model of memory — and a little-heralded type of brain cell — might explain why the human brain has such a huge storage capacity, researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2417788122" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;

According to a new study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, a daily dose of &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D3 may significantly delay aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D3 may significantly delay aging&lt;/a&gt; by protecting the DNA stored in your chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing more than 1,000 people aged 50 and older from the ongoing larger &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VITAL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; randomized trial at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, researchers from Harvard and the Medical College of Georgia, found &lt;strong&gt;taking 2,000 IUs of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a vitamin D3 supplement daily over four years helped decelerate the aging process&lt;/strong&gt;. How? It turns out vitamin D3 can help to maintain the length of your telomeres, which are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes, like the plastic casings found on shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are important because if telomeres shorten too quickly or by too much, the shortening can speed up the body’s biological aging process, says the study’s principal investigator &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist, Chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study isn’t the first to investigate the potential benefits of a vitamin D3 supplement on telomeres, it is the largest and the longest-term randomized trial to specifically explore the subject. Here’s a deeper dive into what the scientists uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of telomeres in the aging process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to know is telomere shortening is an inherent part of getting older and occur with everyone. In fact, their length is considered a marker of cellular aging. “Telomeres keep your chromosomes stable and prevent them from fraying or degrading when cells are replicating and dividing, and this helps to prevent damage to the cell’s DNA,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell division and replication is a natural biological function of aging, and when each cell divides or replicates, the telomeres shorten a bit. The shortening means there’s more of a chance the DNA in our chromosomes will be more vulnerable to damage and degradation, putting you at an increased risk of age-related chronic diseases, such as heart disease and certain kinds of cancers, including bladder, brain, esophageal and lung, says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomere shortening is also associated with some inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The researchers were curious to see if one of the supplements they’ve been studying in the VITAL trial might have a positive response for preserving telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that we’ve seen the benefits of vitamin D for reducing or ‘tamping down’ inflammation and in lowering the risk of autoimmune diseases, in this study we were interested in seeing whether it has a role in slowing down the clock for biological aging, which is also linked to inflammation,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year study tracked 1,054 U.S. adults, &lt;strong&gt;comprised of women aged 55 or older and men 50 and older&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers chose to examine people 50 and older because it’s during this time when the chances of chronic diseases start to increase, notes Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals were divided into two groups: One was given a placebo, while the others took both a daily vitamin D3 (2,000 IUs) supplement and a separate omega 3 fatty acid (1 g.) supplement. To examine telomere length in the participants’ white blood cells, blood was taken at the start of the study, and again at the second- and fourth-year mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, the two groups were identical, but at the two-year point, the researchers saw those in the vitamin D3 group had less telomere shortening. However, it was at the four-year mark where the differences really became apparent. It turns out compared to the placebo group, &lt;strong&gt;those who took the vitamin D3 supplement significantly reduced their telomere shortening, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging&lt;/strong&gt;. The omega 3 fatty acid supplement had no real significant effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible explanation? “We found a reduction in an inflammation C-reactive protein [in the vitamin D3 group] and think the effect of vitamin D3 in tamping down inflammation may be one of the reasons for less telomere shortening,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manson says her team was surprised by the magnitude of the study. “We did expect vitamin D would slow telomere shortening but didn’t expect to see such a difference in when it came to the time period,” she reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the vitamin D3 looks promising as a pathway to counter biological aging, Dr. Manson says more research needs to be done. “We always say a study’s findings need to be replicated, so we want to see if these results are the same in another large trial before public health guidelines can be changed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin

yogurt, cereals, and orange juice, says &lt;a href="https://medicine.vumc.org/department-directory/Heidi-Silver" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heidi J.
